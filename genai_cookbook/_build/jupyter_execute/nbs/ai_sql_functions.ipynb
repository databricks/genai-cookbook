    "# Query Foundation Models with Databricks SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to use the [`ai_query`](https://docs.databricks.com/en/sql/language-manual/functions/ai_query.html) SQL function to query models from the Foundation Model API. The `ai_query` function provides a simple and familiar SQL interface to Large Language Models via the Foundation Model API. It also provides a straightforward way to integrate LLMs into existing SQL-based Databricks workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic usage of the `ai_query` function takes a model endpoint name and a text query and returns a single result.\n",

    "### Generate Completions\n",
    "\n",
    "We can generate chat or text completions with supported Foundation Model API models as follows:"
