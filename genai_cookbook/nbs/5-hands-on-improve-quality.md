**Overview**

While a basic RAG chain is relatively straightforward to implement, refining it to consistently produce high-quality outputs is often non-trivial. Identifying the root causes of issues and determining which levers of the solution to pull to improve output quality requires understanding the various components and their interactions.

Simply vectorizing a set of documents, retrieving them via semantic search, and passing the retrieved documents to an LLM is not sufficient to guarantee optimal results. To yield high-quality outputs, you need to consider factors such as (but not limited to) chunking strategy of documents, choice of LLM and model parameters, or whether to include a query understanding step. As a result, ensuring high quality RAG outputs will generally involve iterating over both the data pipeline (e.g., chunking) and the RAG chain itself (e.g., choice of LLM).
