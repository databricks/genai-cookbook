    "# 10 minute demo of Mosaic AI Agent Framework & Agent Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TLDR; this notebook will:\n",
    "1. Deploy a RAG application built with [Agent Framework](https://docs.databricks.com/generative-ai/retrieval-augmented-generation.html) to the [Agent Evaluation](https://docs.databricks.com/generative-ai/agent-evaluation/index.html) review application\n",
    "    - The review application is used by your business stakeholders to provide feedback on your app\n",
    "2. Evaluate the quality of the application with [Agent Evaluation](https://docs.databricks.com/generative-ai/agent-evaluation/index.html) and MLflow\n",
    "    - These AI-assisted evaluations are used by developers to improve the application's quality\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Products used:\n",
    "- [**Mosaic AI Agent Framework**](https://docs.databricks.com/generative-ai/retrieval-augmented-generation.html) SDK to quickly and safely build high-quality RAG applications.\n",
    "- [**Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation**](https://docs.databricks.com/generative-ai/agent-evaluation/index.html) AI-assisted evaluation tool to determines if outputs are high-quality.  Provides an intuitive UI to get feedback from human stakeholders.\n",
    "- [**Mosaic AI Model Serving**](https://docs.databricks.com/generative-ai/deploy-agent.html) Hosts the application's logic as a production-ready, scalable REST API.\n",
    "- [**MLflow**](https://docs.databricks.com/mlflow/index.html) Tracks and manages the application lifecycle, including evaluation results and application code/config\n",
    "- [**Generative AI Cookbook**](https://ai-cookbook.io/) A definitive how-to guide, backed by a code repo, for building high-quality Gen AI apps, developed in partnership with Mosaic AIâ€™s research team.\n",
