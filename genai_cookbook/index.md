# Databricks Generative AI Cookbook

**TLDR;** this cookbook and its sample code will take you from initial POC to high-quality production-ready application using [Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation](https://docs.databricks.com/generative-ai/agent-evaluation/index.html) and [Mosaic AI Agent Framework](https://docs.databricks.com/generative-ai/retrieval-augmented-generation.html) on the Databricks platform.

The Databricks Generative AI Cookbook is a definitive how-to guide for building *high-quality* generative AI applications. *High-quality* applications are applications that:
1. **Accurate:** provide correct responses
2. **Safe:** do not deliver harmful or insecure responses
3. **Governed:** respect data permissions & access controls and track lineage

Developed in partnership with Mosaic AI's research team, this cookbook lays out Databricks best-practice development workflow for building high-quality RAG apps: *evaluation driven development.* It outlines the most relevant knobs & approaches that can increase RAG application quality and provides a comprehensive repository of sample code implementing those techniques. 

```{important}
- Only have a few minutes and want to see a demo of Mosaic AI Agent Framework & Agent Evaluation?  Start [here](https://ai-cookbook.io/10-min-demo/mosaic-ai-agents-demo-dbx-notebook.html).
- Want to hop into code and deploy a RAG POC using your data?  Start [here](./nbs/6-implement-overview.md).
- Don't have any data, but want to deploy a sample RAG application?  Start here.

This cookbook is intended for use with the Databricks platform.  Specifically:
- [Mosaic AI Agent Framework](https://docs.databricks.com/generative-ai/retrieval-augmented-generation.html) which provides a fast developer workflow with enterprise-ready LLMops & governance
- [Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation](https://docs.databricks.com/generative-ai/agent-evaluation/index.html) which provides reliable, quality measurement using proprietary AI-assisted LLM judges to measure quality metrics that are powered by human feedback collected through an intuitive web-based chat UI


# Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)

> This first release focuses on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).  Future releases will include the other popular generative AI techniques: agents & function calling, prompt engineering, fine tuning, and pre-training.

The RAG cookbook is divided into 2 sections:
1. **Learn:** Understand the required components of a production-ready, high-quality RAG application
2. **Implement:** Use our sample code to follow an evaluation-driven workflow for delivering a high-quality RAG application
