# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## 1/ Create the Vector Search Index
# MAGIC
# MAGIC First, we copy the sample data to a Delta Table and sync to a Vector Search index.  Here, we use the [gte-large-en-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/Alibaba-NLP/gte-large-en-v1.5) embedding model hosted on [Databricks Foundational Model APIs](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/foundation-models/index.html).

# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now that our Vector Search index is ready, let's prepare the RAG chain and deploy it to the review application backed by a scalable-production ready REST API on Model serving.
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### 2.1/ Configuring our Chain parameters
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Databricks makes it easy to parameterize your chain with MLflow Model Configurations. Later, you can tune application quality by adjusting these parameters, such as the system prompt or retrieval settings.  Most applications will include many more parameters, but for this demo, we'll keep the configuration to a minimum.

# COMMAND ----------

chain_config = {
    "llm_model_serving_endpoint_name": "databricks-dbrx-instruct",  # the foundation model we want to use
    "vector_search_endpoint_name": VECTOR_SEARCH_ENDPOINT,  # Endoint for vector search
    "vector_search_index": f"{CHUNKS_VECTOR_INDEX}",
    "llm_prompt_template": """You are an assistant that answers questions. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. Some pieces of context may be irrelevant, in which case you should not use them to form the answer.\n\nContext: {context}""", # LLM Prompt template
}

# Here, we define an input example in the schema required by Agent Framework
input_example = {"messages": [ {"role": "user", "content": "What is Retrieval-augmented Generation?"}]}

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md-sandbox
# MAGIC ### 2.1/ Log the application & view trace
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We first register the chain as an MLflow model and inspect the MLflow Trace to understand what is happening inside the chain.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### MLflow trace
# MAGIC <br/>
# MAGIC <img src="https://ai-cookbook.io/_images/mlflow_trace2.gif" width="80%" style="margin-left: 10px">

# Log the model to MLflow
with mlflow.start_run(run_name="databricks-docs-bot"):
    logged_chain_info = mlflow.langchain.log_model(
        lc_model=os.path.join(
            os.getcwd(),

        input_example=input_example,  # Save the chain's input schema.  MLflow will execute the chain before logging & capture it's output schema.
    )

# Test the chain locally to see the MLflow Trace
chain = mlflow.langchain.load_model(logged_chain_info.model_uri)
chain.invoke(input_example)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md-sandbox
# MAGIC ### 2.1/ Deploy the application
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now, we:
# MAGIC 1. Register the application in Unity Catalog
# MAGIC 2. Use Agent Framework to deploy to the Quality Lab review application
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Along side the review ap, a scalable, production-ready Model Serving endpoint is also deployed.

# MAGIC # 3/ Use Agent Evaluation to evaluate your application
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## 3.1/ Have stakeholders chat your bot to build your evaluation dataset
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Normally, you would now give access to internal domain experts and have them test and review the bot.  **Your domain experts do NOT need to have Databricks Workspace access** - you can assign permissions to any user in your SSO if you have enabled [SCIM](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/users-groups/scim/index.html)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This is a critical step to build or improve your evaluation dataset: have users ask questions to your bot, and provide the bot with output answer when they don't answer properly.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Your applicaation is automatically capturing all stakeholder questions and bot responses, including the MLflow Trace for each, into Delta Tables in your Lakehouse. On top of that, Databricks makes it easy to track feedback from your end user: if the chatbot doesn't give a good answer and the user gives a thumbdown, their feedback is included in the Delta Tables.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Your evaluation dataset forms the basis of your development workflow to improve quality: identifying the root causes of quality issues and then objectively measuring the impact of your fixes.

# MAGIC ## 3.2/ Run Evaluation of your Chain
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now, let's use everage Agent Evaluation's specialized AI evaluators to evaluate our model performance.  Agent Evaluation is integrated into `mlflow.evaluate(...)`, all you need to do is pass `model_type="databricks-agent"`.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For this demo, we use a toy 10 question evaluation dataset.  Read more about our [best practices](https://ai-cookbook.io/nbs/4-evaluation-eval-sets.html) on the size of your evaluation dataset.

To diagnose this issue, you can check the Spark UI to identify the longest stage of the job and look at the Input, Output, Shuffle Read, and Shuffle Write columns. If there is only one task, it could be a sign of a problem. To resolve this issue, you can try optimizing your Spark job by avoiding the aforementioned causes.

Monitor memory usage: Monitor memory usage in your Databricks workspace to identify potential memory leaks or inefficient memory utilization. Use tools like the Spark UI, Ganglia, or Grafana to monitor memory usage.",

# MAGIC The Databricks Generative AI Cookbook is a definitive how-to guide for building *high-quality* generative AI applications. *High-quality* applications are applications that:
# MAGIC 1. **Accurate:** provide correct responses
# MAGIC 2. **Safe:** do not deliver harmful or insecure responses
# MAGIC 3. **Governed:** respect data permissions & access controls and track lineage
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Developed in partnership with Mosaic AI's research team, this cookbook lays out Databricks best-practice development workflow for building high-quality RAG apps: *evaluation driven development.* It outlines the most relevant knobs & approaches that can increase RAG application quality and provides a comprehensive repository of sample code implementing those techniques.
