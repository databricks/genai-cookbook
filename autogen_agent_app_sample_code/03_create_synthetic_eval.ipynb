       "ML workflows include the following key assets: code, models and data. These assets need to be developed\n",
       "\n",
       "(dev), tested (staging) and deployed (prod). For each stage, we also need to operate within an execution\n",

       "\n",
       "staging and prod.\n",
       "\n",
       "These divisions can best be understood in terms of quality guarantees and access control. On one end,\n",
       "\n",
       "assets in prod are generally business critical, with the highest guarantee of quality and tightest control on\n",

       "\n",
       "of quality.\n",
       "\n",
       "For example, many data scientists will work together in a dev environment, freely producing dev model\n",
       "\n",
       "prototypes. Any flaws in these models are relatively low risk for the business, as they are separate from\n",
       "\n",
       "the live product. In contrast, the staging environment replicates the execution environment of production.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here, code changes made in the dev environment are tested prior to code being deployed to production.\n",

       "The staging environment acts as a gateway for code to reach production, and accordingly, fewer people\n",

       "are given access to staging. Code promoted to production is considered a live product. In the production\n",

       "|Many LLMs take general natural language queries and instructions as input. Those queries can contain carefully engineered ‚Äúprompts‚Äù to elicit the desired responses.|Development process: Designing text templates for querying LLMs is often an important part of developing new LLM pipelines. Packaging ML artifacts: Many LLM pipelines will use existing LLMs or LLM serving endpoints; the ML logic developed for those pipelines may focus on prompt templates, agents or ‚Äúchains‚Äù instead of the model itself. The ML artifacts packaged and promoted to production may frequently be these pipelines, rather than models.|\n",
       "|Many LLMs can be given prompts with examples and context, or additional information to help answer the query.|Serving infrastructure: When augmenting LLM queries with context, it is valuable to use previously uncommon tooling such as vector databases to search for relevant context.|\n",
       "|LLMs are very large deep learning models, often ranging from gigabytes to hundreds of gigabytes.|Serving infrastructure: Many LLMs may require GPUs for real-time model serving. Cost/performance trade-offs: Since larger models require more computation and are thus more expensive to serve, techniques for reducing model size and computation may be required.|\n",
       "|LLMs are hard to evaluate via traditional ML metrics since there is often no single ‚Äúright‚Äù answer.|Human feedback: Since human feedback is essential for evaluating and testing LLMs, it must be incorporated more directly into the MLOps process, both for testing and monitoring and for future fine-tuning.|\n",

       "**Challenges with data lakes**\n",
       "Data lakes are a common element within modern data architectures. They serve as a\n",
       "central ingestion point for the plethora of data that organizations seek to gather and\n",
       "mine. While a good step forward in getting to grips with the range of data, they run\n",
       "into the following common problems:\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "-----\n",
       "\n",
       "**1. \u0007Reading and writing into data lakes is not reliable.** Data engineers often run into\n",
       "the problem of unsafe writes into data lakes that cause readers to see garbage\n",
       "data during writes. They have to build workarounds to ensure readers always see\n",
       "consistent data during writes.\n",
       "\n",
       "**2. \u0007The data quality in data lakes is low.** Dumping unstructured data into a data\n",
       "lake is easy, but this comes at the cost of data quality. Without any mechanisms\n",
       "for validating schema and the data, data lakes suffer from poor data quality. As a\n",
       "consequence, analytics projects that strive to mine this data also fail.\n",
       "\n",
       "**3. Poor performance with increasing amounts of data.** As the amount of data\n",
       "that gets dumped into a data lake increases, the number of files and directories\n",
       "also increases. Big data jobs and query engines that process the data spend a\n",
       "significant amount of time handling the metadata operations. This problem is more\n",
       "pronounced in the case of streaming jobs or handling many concurrent batch jobs.\n",
       "\n",
       "**4. \u0007Modifying, updating or deleting records in data lakes is hard.** Engineers need to\n",
       "build complicated pipelines to read entire partitions or tables, modify the data and\n",
       "write them back. Such pipelines are inefficient and hard to maintain.\n",
       "\n",
       "Because of these challenges, many big data projects fail to deliver on their vision or\n",
       "sometimes just fail altogether. We need a solution that enables data practitioners to\n",
       "make use of their existing data lakes, while ensuring data quality.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Delta Lake‚Äôs key functionalities**\n",
       "Delta Lake addresses the above problems to simplify how you build your data lakes.\n",
       "Delta Lake offers the following key functionalities:\n",
       "\n",
       "**‚Ä¢ ACID transactions:** Delta Lake provides ACID transactions between multiple\n",
       "writes. Every write is a transaction, and there is a serial order for writes recorded in\n",
       "a transaction log. The transaction log tracks writes at file level and uses [optimistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control)\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "-----\n",
       "\n",
       "[concurrency control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control) , which is ideally suited for data lakes since multiple writes\n",
       "trying to modify the same files don‚Äôt happen that often. In scenarios where\n",
       "there is a conflict, Delta Lake throws a concurrent modification exception for\n",
       "users to handle them and retry their jobs. Delta Lake also offers the highest level\n",
       "of isolation possible ( [serializable isolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(database_systems)#Serializable) ) that allows engineers to continuously\n",
       "keep writing to a directory or table and consumers to keep reading from the same\n",
       "directory or table. Readers will see the latest snapshot that existed at the time the\n",
       "reading started.\n",
       "\n",
       "**‚Ä¢ \u0007Schema management:** Delta Lake automatically validates that the schema of the\n",
       "DataFrame being written is compatible with the schema of the table. Columns that\n",
       "are present in the table but not in the DataFrame are set to null. If there are extra\n",
       "columns in the DataFrame that are not present in the table, this operation throws\n",
       "an exception. Delta Lake has DDL to add new columns explicitly and the ability to\n",
       "update the schema automatically.\n",
       "\n",
       "**‚Ä¢ \u0007Scalable metadata handling:** Delta Lake stores the metadata information of\n",
       "a table or directory in the transaction log instead of the metastore. This allows\n",
       "Delta Lake to list files in large directories in constant time and be efficient while\n",
       "reading data.\n",
       "\n",
       "**‚Ä¢ Data versioning and time travel:** Delta Lake allows users to read a previous\n",
       "snapshot of the table or directory. When files are modified during writes, Delta\n",
       "Lake creates newer versions of the files and preserves the older versions. When\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "users want to read the older versions of the table or directory, they can provide\n",
       "a timestamp or a version number to Apache Spark‚Äôs read APIs, and Delta Lake\n",
       "constructs the full snapshot as of that timestamp or version based on the\n",
       "information in the transaction log. This allows users to reproduce experiments and\n",
       "reports and also revert a table to its older versions, if needed.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "However, as companies place mandates on becoming more data-driven,\n",
       "their data teams are left in a sprint to deliver the right data for business\n",
       "insights and innovation. With the widespread adoption of cloud, data teams\n",
       "often invest in large-scale complex data systems that have capabilities for\n",
       "streaming, business intelligence, analytics and machine learning to support\n",
       "the overall business objectives.\n",
       "\n",
       "To support these objectives, data teams have deployed cloud data\n",
       "\n",
       "warehouses and data lakes.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Traditional data systems: The data warehouse and data lake\n",
       "\n",
       "With the advent of big data, companies began collecting large amounts of\n",
       "data from many different sources, such as weblogs, sensor data and images.\n",
       "Data warehouses ‚Äî which have a long history as the foundation for decision\n",
       "support and business intelligence applications ‚Äî cannot handle large volumes\n",
       "of data.\n",
       "\n",
       "While data warehouses are great for structured data and historical analysis,\n",
       "they weren‚Äôt designed for unstructured data, semi-structured data, and data\n",
       "with high variety, velocity and volume, making them unsuitable for many types\n",
       "of data.\n",
       "\n",
       "This led to the introduction of data lakes, providing a single repository of raw\n",
       "data in a variety of formats. While suitable for storing big data, data lakes do\n",
       "not support transactions, nor do they enforce data quality, and their lack of\n",
       "consistency/isolation makes it almost impossible to read, write or process data.\n",
       "\n",
       "For these reasons, many of the promises of data lakes never materialized and,\n",
       "in many cases, reduced the benefits of data warehouses.\n",
       "\n",
       "As companies discovered new use cases for data exploration, predictive modeling\n",
       "and prescriptive analytics, the need for a single, flexible, high-performance system\n",
       "only grew. Data teams require systems for diverse data applications including SQL\n",

       "\n",
       "-----\n",
       "\n",
       "To solve for new use cases and new users, a common approach is to use multiple\n",
       "systems ‚Äî a data lake, several data warehouses and other specialized systems\n",
       "such as streaming, time-series, graph and image databases. But having multiple\n",
       "systems introduces complexity and delay, as data teams invariably need to\n",
       "move or copy data between different systems, effectively losing oversight and\n",
       "governance over data usage.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "You have now duplicated data in two different systems and the changes you\n",

       "measurable value from data. The challenge is that most companies continue to\n",
       "implement two different platforms: data warehouses for BI and data lakes for AI.\n",
       "These platforms are incompatible with each other, but data from both systems\n",
       "is generally needed to deliver game-changing outcomes, which makes success\n",
       "with AI extremely difficult.\n",
       "\n",
       "Today, most of the data is landing in the data lake, and a lot of it is unstructured.\n",
       "In fact, according to [IDC](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US47998321) , about 80% of the data in any organization will be\n",
       "unstructured by 2025. But, this data is where much of the value from AI resides.\n",
       "Subsets of the data are then copied to the data warehouse into structured\n",
       "tables, and back again in some cases.\n",
       "\n",
       "You also must secure and govern the data in both warehouses and offer\n",
       "fine-grained governance, while lakes tend to be coarser grained at the file level.\n",

       "the kind of flexibility and openness that allows your organization to stay agile\n",
       "as you scale. Here are key features to consider when evaluating data lakehouse\n",
       "architectures:\n",
       "\n",
       "Transaction support: In an enterprise lakehouse, many data pipelines will\n",
       "often be reading and writing data concurrently. Support for ACID (Atomicity,\n",
       "Consistency, Isolation and Durability) transactions ensures consistency as\n",
       "multiple parties concurrently read or write data.\n",
       "\n",
       "Schema enforcement and governance: The lakehouse should have\n",
       "a way to support schema enforcement and evolution, supporting data\n",
       "warehouse schema paradigms such as star/snowflake. The system should\n",
       "be able to reason about data integrity, and it should have robust governance\n",
       "and auditing mechanisms.\n",
       "\n",
       "Data governance: Capabilities including auditing, retention and lineage\n",
       "have become essential, particularly considering recent privacy regulations.\n",
       "\n",
       "Tools that allow data discovery have become popular, such as data catalogs\n",
       "and data usage metrics.\n",
       "\n",
       "BI support: Lakehouses allow the use of BI tools directly on the source\n",
       "data. This reduces staleness and latency, improves recency and lowers cost\n",
       "by not having to operationalize two copies of the data in both a data lake\n",
       "and a warehouse.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Storage decoupled from compute: In practice, this means storage and\n",
       "compute use separate clusters, thus these systems can scale to many more\n",
       "concurrent users and larger data sizes. Some modern data warehouses also\n",
       "have this property.\n",
       "\n",
       "Openness: The storage formats, such as Apache Parquet, are open and\n",
       "standardized, so a variety of tools and engines, including machine learning\n",
       "and Python/R libraries, can efficiently access the data directly.\n",
       "\n",
       "Support for diverse data types (unstructured and structured):\n",
       "The lakehouse can be used to store, refine, analyze and access data types\n",
       "needed for many new data applications, including images, video, audio,\n",
       "semi-structured data and text.\n",
       "\n",
       "Support for diverse workloads: Use the same data repository for a range\n",
       "of workloads including data science, machine learning and SQL analytics.\n",
       "Multiple tools might be needed to support all these workloads.\n",
       "\n",
       "End-to-end streaming: Real-time reports are the norm in many enterprises.\n",
       "Support for streaming eliminates the need for separate systems dedicated to\n",
       "serving real-time data applications.\n",

       "Apache Spark‚Ñ¢ and other processing engines.\n",
       "\n",
       "Delta Lake uses Delta Tables which are based on Apache Parquet, a commonly\n",
       "used format for structured data already utilized by many organizations. Therefore,\n",

       "make these types of data easily managed as well.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "As for performance, data lakes use object storage, so data is mostly kept in\n",
       "immutable files leading to the following problems:\n",
       "\n",
       "**‚Ä¢** **Ineffective partitioning:** In many cases, data engineers resort to ‚Äúpoor man‚Äôs‚Äù\n",
       "indexing practices in the form of partitioning that leads to hundreds of dev hours\n",

       "proves to be ineffective over time if the wrong field was selected for partitioning\n",
       "or due to high cardinality columns.\n",
       "\n",
       "**‚Ä¢** **Too many small files:** With no support for transactions, appending new data\n",

       "through many of Delta Lake‚Äôs most notable features, including ACID transactions,\n",
       "scalable metadata handling, time travel and more. The Delta Lake transaction log\n",
       "is an ordered record of every transaction that has ever been performed on\n",
       "a Delta Lake table since its inception.\n",
       "\n",
       "Delta Lake is built on top of Spark to allow multiple readers and writers of a\n",
       "given table to work on a table at the same time. To always show users correct\n",
       "views of the data, the transaction log serves as a single source of truth: the\n",
       "central repository that tracks all changes that users make to the table.\n",
       "\n",
       "When a user reads a Delta Lake table for the first time or runs a new query on\n",
       "an open table that has been modified since the last time it was read, Spark\n",
       "checks the transaction log to see what new transactions are posted to the table.\n",
       "Then, Spark updates the table with those recent changes. This ensures that a\n",
       "user‚Äôs version of a table is always synchronized with the master record as of the\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Batch processing refers to the discontinuous, periodic processing\n",

       "the need to access, process and analyze the volume, speed and variety of this\n",
       "data moving through their platforms. To keep pace with innovation, they must\n",

       "\n",
       "Three common technical challenges organizations experience\n",
       "with implementing real-time data streaming include:\n",
       "\n",
       "**‚Ä¢** **Specialized APIs and language skills:** Data practitioners encounter\n",
       "barriers to adopting streaming skillsets because there are new languages,\n",

       "\n",
       "**‚Ä¢** **Operational complexity:** To implement data streaming at scale, data\n",
       "teams need to integrate and manage streaming-specific tools with\n",
       "their other cloud services. They also have to manually build complex\n",
       "operational tooling to help these systems recover from failure, restart\n",
       "workloads without reprocessing data, optimize performance, scale the\n",
       "underlying infrastructure, and so on.\n",
       "\n",
       "**‚Ä¢** **Incompatible governance models:** Different governance and security\n",

       "**‚Ä¢** **Preventative maintenance:** By reducing unplanned outages and\n",
       "unnecessary site and maintenance visits, real-time streaming analytics can\n",

       "First, streaming capture systems **capture** and temporarily store streaming data\n",
       "for processing. Sometimes these systems are also called messaging systems\n",

       "according to the following seven phases:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Data is continuously generated at origin points\n",
       "\n",
       "2. The generated data is captured from those origin points by\n",

       "\n",
       "In recent years, there has been a significant\n",
       "breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence with\n",
       "the emergence of large language models (LLMs)\n",
       "and generative AI. These models, such as GPT-4 and\n",

       "built using deep learning techniques and massive\n",
       "amounts of training data, enabling them to generate\n",
       "human-like text and perform a wide range of natural\n",
       "language processing tasks. LLMs and generative AI\n",

       "margins in commoditized products. Open insurance,\n",
       "which involves sharing and managing insurancerelated data through APIs, is more than an item in\n",
       "the regulatory agenda. It can give consumers access\n",

       "to build solutions capable of real-time processing. This enables them to alert\n",

       "\n",
       "**Commercial insurance** , including property, general liability, cyber insurance and\n",
       "business income insurance, utilizes ML-based automation of actuarial models.\n",
       "This automation facilitates underwriting, claims forecasting and dynamic pricing\n",
       "for their customers. Another notable trend in recent years is the use of IoT-\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "based alerting for sensitive or valuable commodities. For example, in the case of\n",
       "vaccines, IoT sensors can monitor the temperature in real time and send alerts to\n",
       "the appropriate team or person if the temperature exceeds acceptable thresholds.\n",
       "This is crucial as vaccines must be stored within specific temperature ranges.\n",
       "\n",

       "## The four driving forces of change\n",
       "\n",
       "###### Over the last two years, demand imbalances and supply chain swings have added a sense of urgency for manufacturers to digitally transform. But in truth, the main challenges facing the industry have existed, and will continue to exist, outside these recent exceptional circumstances. Manufacturers will always strive for greater levels of visibility across their supply chain, always seek to optimize and streamline operations to improve margins. In the continuing quest for improved efficiency, productivity, adaptability and resilience, manufacturers are commonly tackling these major challenges:\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "###### Skills and production gaps\n",
       "\n",
       "The rise of the digital economy is demanding a new set of skills.\n",
       "For today‚Äôs Intelligent Manufacturing organizations, there‚Äôs a fundamental\n",
       "need for computer and programming skills for automation, along\n",
       "with critical-thinking abilities. Also important is the ability to use\n",
       "collaboration systems and new advanced assistance tools, such as\n",
       "automation, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). The deficit\n",
       "of workers with these skills is of critical concern to manufacturers.\n",
       "\n",
       "In addition, the industry dynamics are pushing companies to increase\n",
       "and refine both partner/supplier relationships, optimize internal\n",
       "operations and build robust supply chains that do not rely upon\n",
       "safety stock to weather supply chain swings. Historical focus on\n",
       "operational use cases is now extending to building agile supply chains.\n",
       "\n",
       "###### Supply chain volatility\n",
       "\n",
       "If the events of the last few years proved anything, it‚Äôs that supply\n",
       "chains need to be robust and resilient. Historically, supply chain volatility\n",
       "was smoothed by holding ‚Äúsafety stock,‚Äù which added costs without\n",
       "financial value. Then the pendulum swung to ‚Äújust in time delivery,‚Äù\n",
       "where efficient use of working capital disregarded demand risks.\n",
       "\n",
       "Recent experiences have highlighted that demand sensing is needed\n",
       "in addition to safety stock for high-risk parts or raw materials. The ability\n",
       "to monitor, predict and respond to external factors ‚Äì including natural\n",
       "disasters, shipping and warehouse constraints, and geopolitical disruption\n",
       "‚Äì is vital to reduce risk and promote agility. Many of these external\n",
       "data sources leverage unstructured data (news, social posts, videos\n",
       "and images), and being able to manage both structured and unstructured\n",
       "data available to measure and analyze this volatility is key.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "###### Need for new and additional sources of revenue\n",
       "\n",
       "Manufacturers‚Äô growth historically has been limited\n",
       "to new product introduction rate or expansion into\n",

       "businesses are in unison with use cases such as predictive\n",
       "maintenance, stock replenishment and worker safety.\n",

       "###### An increased focus on sustainability\n",
       "\n",
       "Manufacturers have always focused on efficiency,\n",
       "but they‚Äôre increasingly seeing the value chain as circular.\n",
       "It‚Äôs no longer enough to consider an organization‚Äôs own\n",
       "carbon footprint ‚Äì it needs to also include indirect\n",
       "emissions and other environmental impacts from the\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "According to George Webster, head of cybersecurity sciences and analytics at\n",
       "HSBC, Lakehouse and SIEM is the pattern for security operations. What does\n",
       "it look like? It leverages the strengths of the two components: Lakehouse for\n",
       "multicloud native storage and analytics, SIEM for security operations workflows.\n",
       "For Databricks customers like HSBC, there are two general patterns for this\n",
       "integration that are both underpinned by what Webster calls the cybersecurity\n",
       "data lake with Lakehouse.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the first pattern, Lakehouse stores all the data for the maximum retention\n",
       "period. A subset of the data is then sent to the SIEM and stored for a fraction of\n",
       "the time. This pattern has the advantage of allowing analysts to query near-term\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "data using the SIEM while having the ability to do historical analysis and more\n",
       "sophisticated analytics in Databricks. It also lets them manage any licensing or\n",
       "storage costs for the SIEM deployment.\n",
       "\n",
       "The second pattern is to send the highest-volume data sources to Databricks ‚Äî\n",
       "for example, cloud-native logs, endpoint threat detection and response logs, DNS\n",
       "data and network events. Low-volume data sources such as alerts, e-mail logs\n",
       "and vulnerability scan data go to the SIEM. This pattern enables Tier 1 analysts to\n",
       "quickly handle high-priority alerts in the SIEM. Threat-hunt teams and investigators\n",
       "can leverage the advanced analytical capabilities of Databricks. This pattern has a\n",
       "cost-benefit of offloading processing, ingestion and storage from the SIEM.\n",

       "### Introduction\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Most organizations operate their business with a complex data architecture that\n",
       "combines data warehouses and data lakes. For one thing, data lakes are great\n",
       "for machine learning (ML). They support open formats and a large ecosystem.\n",
       "But data lakes have poor support for business intelligence (BI) and suffer\n",
       "complex data quality problems. Data warehouses, on the other hand, are great\n",
       "for BI applications. But they have limited support for ML workloads, can‚Äôt handle\n",
       "natural language data, large-scale structured data, or raw, video, audio or image\n",
       "files, and are proprietary systems with only a SQL interface.\n",
       "\n",
       "As a result, data is moved around the organization through data pipelines and\n",
       "systems that create a multitude of data silos. A large amount of time is spent\n",
       "maintaining these pipelines and systems rather than creating new value from\n",
       "data, and downstream consumers struggle to get a single source of truth of the\n",
       "data due to the inherent siloing of data that takes place. The situation becomes\n",
       "very expensive, and decision-making speed and quality are negatively affected.\n",
       "\n",
       "Unifying these systems can be transformational in how we think about data.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "##### The need for simplification\n",
       "\n",
       "It is time for a new data architecture that can meet both today‚Äôs and tomorrow‚Äôs\n",
       "needs. Without any compromise. Advanced analytics and ML are one of the\n",
       "most strategic priorities for data-driven organizations today, and the amount\n",
       "of unstructured data is growing exponentially. So it makes sense to position\n",
       "the data lake as the center of the data infrastructure. However, for this to be\n",
       "achievable, the data lake needs to adopt the strengths of data warehouses.\n",
       "\n",
       "The answer is the [lakehouse](https://databricks.com/blog/2021/05/19/evolution-to-the-data-lakehouse.html) , an open data architecture enabled by a new open\n",
       "and standardized system design: one that implements data structure and data\n",
       "management features similar to those in a data warehouse, directly on the lowcost storage used for data lakes.\n",

Building on that foundation, agencies are starting to adopt advanced analytics and AI to automate costly, outdated and resource-intensive operations as well as improve decisionmaking with predictive insights that can better keep pace with the dynamic needs of citizens and global communities. That being said, there are a number of barriers standing in their way.\n",

       "##### Common challenges\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Many government agencies are burdened with a legacy IT infrastructure that is\n",

       "to scale as compute is coupled with storage, and lack support for unstructured\n",
       "data and advanced analytics. This severely inhibits data-driven innovation.\n",
       "Maintaining these systems requires a massive investment of both time and\n",

       "There are a few paths that one can take when looking to apply large language\n",
       "models for their given use case. Generally speaking, you can break them down\n",
       "into two categories, but there‚Äôs some crossover between each. We‚Äôll briefly cover\n",
       "the pros and cons of each and what scenarios fit best for each.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Proprietary services\n",
       "\n",
       "As the first widely available LLM powered service, OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT was the\n",
       "explosive charge that brought LLMs into the mainstream. ChatGPT provides\n",
       "a nice user interface (or API) where users can feed prompts to one of many\n",
       "models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and more) and typically get a fast response. These are\n",
       "among the highest-performing models, trained on enormous data sets, and are\n",
       "capable of extremely complex tasks both from a technical standpoint, such as\n",
       "code generation, as well as from a creative perspective like writing poetry in a\n",
       "specific style.\n",
       "\n",
       "The downside of these services is the absolutely enormous amount of compute\n",
       "required not only to train them (OpenAI has said GPT-4 cost them over $100\n",
       "million to develop) but also to serve the responses. For this reason, these\n",
       "extremely large models will likely always be under the control of organizations,\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "and require you to send your data to their servers in order to interact with their\n",
       "language models. This raises privacy and security concerns, and also subjects\n",
       "users to ‚Äúblack box‚Äù models, whose training and guardrails they have no control\n",
       "over. Also, due to the compute required, these services are not free beyond a\n",
       "very limited use, so cost becomes a factor in applying these at scale.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary: Proprietary services are great to use if you have very complex tasks,\n",
       "are okay with sharing your data with a third party, and are prepared to incur\n",
       "costs if operating at any significant scale.\n",
       "\n",
       "##### Open source models\n",
       "\n",
       "The other avenue for language models is to go to the open source community,\n",
       "where there has been similarly explosive growth over the past few years.\n",
       "Communities like [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) gather hundreds of thousands of models\n",

However,\naccessing and managing data for these initiatives has become increasingly\ncomplex. Most of the complexity has arisen with the explosion of data volumes\nand data types, with organizations amassing an estimated [80% of data in](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/01/29/the-80-blind-spot-are-you-ignoring-unstructured-organizational-data/?sh=681651dc211c)\n[unstructured and semi-structured format](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/01/29/the-80-blind-spot-are-you-ignoring-unstructured-organizational-data/?sh=681651dc211c) . As the collection of data continues\nto increase, 73% of the data goes unused for analytics or decision-making. In\norder to try and decrease this percentage and make more data usable, data\nengineering teams are responsible for building data pipelines to efficiently and\nreliably deliver data. But the process of building these complex data pipelines\ncomes with a number of difficulties:\n\n**‚Ä¢** In order to get data into a data lake, data engineers are required\nto spend immense time hand-coding repetitive data ingestion tasks\n\n**‚Ä¢** Since data platforms continuously change, data engineers\nspend time building and maintaining, and then rebuilding, complex\nscalable infrastructure\n\n**‚Ä¢** As data pipelines become more complex, data engineers are\nrequired to find reliable tools to orchestrate these pipelines\n\n**‚Ä¢** With the increasing importance of real-time data, low latency data\npipelines are required, which are even more difficult to build and maintain\n\n**‚Ä¢** Finally, with all pipelines written, data engineers need to constantly\nfocus on performance, tuning pipelines and architectures to meet SLAs\n\n\n**How can Databricks help?**\n\nWith the Databricks Lakehouse Platform, data engineers have access to an\nend-to-end data engineering solution for ingesting, transforming, processing,\nscheduling and delivering data. The Lakehouse Platform automates the\ncomplexity of building and maintaining pipelines and running ETL workloads\ndirectly on a data lake so data engineers can focus on quality and reliability to\ndrive valuable insights.\n\nLakehouse Platform\n\n**One platform to support multiple personas**\n\n\n**BI & Data**\n**Warehousing**\n\n\n**Data**\n**Engineering**\n\n\n**Data**\n**Streaming**\n\n\n**Data**\n**Science & ML**\n\n\n¬©2023 Databricks Inc. ‚Äî All rights reserved\n\n\n**Unity Catalog**\n**Fine-grained governance for data and AI**\n\n**Delta Lake**\n**Data reliability and performance**\n\n**Cloud Data Lake**\n\nAll Raw Data (Logs, Texts, Audio, Video, Images)\n\n\nFigure 1\nThe Databricks Lakehouse Platform unifies your data, analytics and AI on one common platform for all your data use cases\n\n\n-----\n\n**Key differentiators for successful data engineering**\n**with Databricks**\n\nBy simplifying on a lakehouse architecture, data engineers need an\nenterprise-grade and enterprise-ready approach to building data pipelines.\nTo be successful, a data engineering solution team must embrace these eight\nkey differentiating capabilities:\n\n**Data ingestion at scale**\nWith the ability to ingest petabytes of data with auto-evolving schemas,\ndata engineers can deliver fast, reliable, scalable and automatic data for\nanalytics, data science or machine learning.

To deliver reliable, trustworthy data, data engineers shouldn‚Äôt\nneed to spend time manually developing and maintaining an end-to-end\nETL lifecycle. Data engineering teams need an efficient, scalable way to\nsimplify ETL development, improve data reliability and manage operations.\n\nAs described, the eight key differentiating capabilities simplify the\nmanagement of the ETL lifecycle by automating and maintaining all data\ndependencies, leveraging built-in quality controls with monitoring and by\nproviding deep visibility into pipeline operations with automatic recovery.\nData engineering teams can now focus on easily and rapidly building reliable\nend-to-end production-ready data pipelines using only SQL or Python\nfor batch and streaming that deliver high-value data for analytics, data\nscience or machine learning.\n\n\n**Follow proven best practices**\n\nIn the next section, we describe best practices for data engineering\nend-to end use cases drawn from real-world examples. From data ingestion\nand real-time processing to analytics and machine learning, you‚Äôll learn\nhow to translate raw data into actionable data.\n\nAs you explore the rest of this guide, you can find data sets and code\nsamples in the various **[Databricks Solution Accelerators](https://www.databricks.com/solutions/accelerators)** , so you can\nget your hands dirty as you explore all aspects of the data lifecycle on the\nDatabricks Lakehouse Platform.\n\n**Start experimenting with these**\n**free Databricks** **notebooks** **.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**SECTION**\n\n# 02\n\n\n### Guidance and Best Practices\n\n**2.1** Top 5 Databricks Performance Tips\n\n**2.2** How to Profile PySpark\n\n**2.3** Low-Latency Streaming Data Pipelines With Delta Live Tables and Apache Kafka\n\n**2.4** Streaming in Production: Collected Best Practices\n\n**2.5** Streaming in Production: Collected Best Practices, Part 2\n\n**2.6** Building Geospatial Data Products\n\n**2.7** Data Lineage With Unity Catalog\n\n**2.8** Easy Ingestion to Lakehouse With COPY INTO\n\n**2.9** Simplifying Change Data Capture With Databricks Delta Live Tables\n\n**2.10** Best Practices for Cross-Government Data Sharing\n\n\n-----\n\nSECTION 2.1\n\n**Top 5 Databricks Performance Tips**\n\nby **B R YA N S M I T H** and **R O B S A K E R**\n\nMarch 10, 2022\n\n\nAs solutions architects, we work closely with customers every day to help them\nget the best performance out of their jobs on Databricks ‚Äî and we often end\nup giving the same advice. It‚Äôs not uncommon to have a conversation with a\ncustomer and get double, triple, or even more performance with just a few\ntweaks. So what‚Äôs the secret? How are we doing this? Here are the top 5 things\nwe see that can make a huge impact on the performance customers get\nfrom Databricks.\n\nHere‚Äôs a TLDR:\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Use larger clusters.** It may sound obvious, but this is the number\none problem we see. It‚Äôs actually not any more expensive to use a large\ncluster for a workload than it is to use a smaller one. It‚Äôs just faster.\nIf there‚Äôs anything you should take away from this article, it‚Äôs this.\n\nRead section 1. Really.\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Use** **[Photon](https://databricks.com/blog/2021/06/17/announcing-photon-public-preview-the-next-generation-query-engine-on-the-databricks-lakehouse-platform.html?itm_data=product-cta-announcingPhotonBlog)** , Databricks‚Äô new, super-fast execution engine. Read section 2\nto learn more. You won‚Äôt regret it.\n\n\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Clean out your configurations** . Configurations carried from one\nApache Spark‚Ñ¢ version to the next can cause massive problems. Clean up!\nRead section 3 to learn more.\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Use** **[Delta Caching](https://docs.databricks.com/delta/optimizations/delta-cache.html)** . There‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôre not using caching\ncorrectly, if at all. See Section 4 to learn more.\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Be aware of lazy evaluation** . If this doesn‚Äôt mean anything to you and\nyou‚Äôre writing Spark code, jump to section 5.\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Bonus tip! Table design is super important** . We‚Äôll go into this in a future\nblog, but for now, check out the [guide on Delta Lake best practices](https://docs.databricks.com/delta/best-practices.html) .\n\n**1. Give your clusters horsepower!**\n\nThis is the number one mistake customers make. Many customers create tiny\nclusters of two workers with four cores each, and it takes forever to do anything.\nThe concern is always the same: they don‚Äôt want to spend too much money on\nlarger clusters. Here‚Äôs the thing: **it‚Äôs actually not any more expensive to use a**\n**large cluster for a workload than it is to use a smaller one. It‚Äôs just faster.**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe key is that you‚Äôre renting the cluster for the length of the workload. So, if\nyou spin up that two worker cluster and it takes an hour, you‚Äôre paying for those\nworkers for the full hour. However, if you spin up a four worker cluster and it takes\nonly half an hour, the cost is actually the same! And that trend continues as long\nas there‚Äôs enough work for the cluster to do.\n\nHere‚Äôs a hypothetical scenario illustrating the point:\n\n**Number of Workers** **Cost Per Hour** **Length of Workload (hours)** **Cost of Workload**\n\n1 $1 2 $2\n\n2 $2 1 $2\n\n4 $4 0.5 $2\n\n8 $8 0.25 $2\n\nNotice that the total cost of the workload stays the same while the real-world\ntime it takes for the job to run drops significantly. So, bump up your Databricks\ncluster specs and speed up your workloads without spending any more money. It\n\ncan‚Äôt really get any simpler than that.\n\n**2. Use Photon**\n\nOur colleagues in engineering have rewritten the Spark execution engine in C++\nand dubbed it Photon. The results are impressive!\n\n\nBeyond the obvious improvements due to running the engine in native code,\nthey‚Äôve also made use of CPU-level performance features and better memory\n\nmanagement. On top of this, they‚Äôve rewritten the Parquet writer in C++. So this\nmakes writing to Parquet and Delta (based on Parquet) super fast as well!\n\nBut let‚Äôs also be clear about what Photon is speeding up. It improves\ncomputation speed for any built-in functions or operations, as well as writes to\nParquet or Delta. So joins? Yep! Aggregations? Sure! ETL? Absolutely! That UDF\n(user-defined function) you wrote? Sorry, but it won‚Äôt help there. The job that‚Äôs\nspending most of its time reading from an ancient on-prem database? Won‚Äôt\nhelp there either, unfortunately.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe good news is that it helps where it can. So even if part of your job can‚Äôt be\nsped up, it will speed up the other parts. Also, most jobs are written with the\nnative operations and spend a lot of time writing to Delta, and Photon helps a lot\nthere. So give it a try. You may be amazed by the results!\n\n**3. Clean out old configurations**\n\nYou know those Spark configurations you‚Äôve been carrying along from version to\nversion and no one knows what they do anymore? They may not be harmless.\nWe‚Äôve seen jobs go from running for hours down to minutes simply by cleaning\nout old configurations. There may have been a quirk in a particular version of\nSpark, a performance tweak that has not aged well, or something pulled off\nsome blog somewhere that never really made sense. At the very least, it‚Äôs worth\nrevisiting your Spark configurations if you‚Äôre in this situation. Often the default\nconfigurations are the best, and they‚Äôre only getting better. Your configurations\nmay be holding you back.\n\n**4. The Delta Cache is your friend**\n\nThis may seem obvious, but you‚Äôd be surprised how many people are not using\nthe [Delta Cache](https://docs.databricks.com/delta/optimizations/delta-cache.html) , which loads data off of cloud storage (S3, ADLS) and keeps it on\nthe workers‚Äô SSDs for faster access.\n\n\nIf you‚Äôre using Databricks SQL Endpoints you‚Äôre in luck. Those have caching on\nby default. In fact, we recommend using [CACHE SELECT * FROM table](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/spark-sql/language-manual/delta-cache.html) to preload\nyour ‚Äúhot‚Äù tables when you‚Äôre starting an endpoint. This will ensure blazing fast\nspeeds for any queries on those tables.\n\nIf you‚Äôre using regular clusters, be sure to use the i3 series on Amazon Web\nServices (AWS), L series or E series on Azure Databricks, or n2 in GCP. These will\nall have fast SSDs and caching enabled by default.\n\nOf course, your mileage may vary. If you‚Äôre doing BI, which involves reading the\nsame tables over and over again, caching gives an amazing boost. However, if\nyou‚Äôre simply reading a table once and writing out the results as in some ETL\njobs, you may not get much benefit. You know your jobs better than anyone.\nGo forth and conquer.\n\n\n-----\n\n**5. Be aware of lazy evaluation**\n\n\nHowever, there is a catch here. Every time you try to display or write out\nresults, it runs the execution plan again. Let‚Äôs look at the same block of code\nbut extend it and do a few more operations.\n\n‚Äî-------\n_# Build an execution plan._\n_# This returns in less than a second but does no work_\ndf2 = (df\n.join(...)\n.select(...)\n.filter(...)\n)\n\n_# Now run the execution plan to get results_\ndf2.display()\n\n_# Unfortunately this will run the plan again, including filtering, joining,_\n_etc_\ndf2.display()\n\n_# So will this‚Ä¶_\ndf2.count()\n‚Äî------\n\n\nIf you‚Äôre a data analyst or data scientist only using SQL or doing BI you can skip\nthis section. However, if you‚Äôre in data engineering and writing pipelines or doing\nprocessing using Databricks/Spark, read on.\n\nWhen you‚Äôre writing Spark code like select, groupBy, filter, etc., you‚Äôre really\nbuilding an execution plan. You‚Äôll notice the code returns almost immediately when\nyou run these functions. That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not actually doing any computation. So\neven if you have petabytes of data, it will return in less than a second.\n\nHowever, once you go to write your results out you‚Äôll notice it takes longer. This\nis due to lazy evaluation. It‚Äôs not until you try to display or write results that your\nexecution plan is actually run.\n\n‚Äî-------\n_# Build an execution plan._\n_# This returns in less than a second but does no work_\ndf2 = (df\n.join(...)\n.select(...)\n. filter (...)\n\n\n_# Now run the execution plan to get results_\ndf2.display()\n‚Äî------\n\n\n-----\n\nThe developer of this code may very well be thinking that they‚Äôre just printing\nout results three times, but what they‚Äôre really doing is kicking off the same\nprocessing three times. Oops. That‚Äôs a lot of extra work. This is a very common\nmistake we run into. So why is there lazy evaluation, and what do we do about it?\n\nIn short, processing with lazy evaluation is way faster than without it.\nDatabricks/Spark looks at the full execution plan and finds opportunities\nfor optimization that can reduce processing time by orders of magnitude.\nSo that‚Äôs great, but how do we avoid the extra computation? The answer\nis pretty straightforward: save computed results you will reuse.\n\n\nThis works especially well when [Delta Caching](https://docs.databricks.com/delta/optimizations/delta-cache.html) is turned on. In short, you\nbenefit greatly from lazy evaluation, but it‚Äôs something a lot of customers trip\nover. So be aware of its existence and save results you reuse in order to avoid\nunnecessary computation.\n\n**Start experimenting with these**\n**free Databricks** **notebooks** **.**\n\n\nLet‚Äôs look at the same block of code again, but this time let‚Äôs avoid the\nrecomputation:\n\n_# Build an execution plan._\n_# This returns in less than a second but does no work_\ndf2 = (df\n.join(...)\n.select(...)\n. filter (...)\n)\n\n_# save it_\ndf2.write.save(path)\n\n_# load it back in_\ndf3 = spark.read.load(path)\n\n_# now use it_\ndf3.display()\n\n_# this is not doing any extra computation anymore.

Furthermore,\nPySpark UDFs offer more flexibility since they enable users to run arbitrary\nPython code on top of the Apache Spark‚Ñ¢ engine. Users only have to state\n‚Äúwhat to do‚Äù; PySpark, as a sandbox, encapsulates ‚Äúhow to do it.‚Äù That makes\nPySpark easier to use, but it can be difficult to identify performance bottlenecks\nand apply custom optimizations.\n\nTo address the difficulty mentioned above, PySpark supports various profiling\ntools, which are all based on [cProfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#module-cProfile) , one of the standard Python [profiler](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html)\n[implementations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html) . PySpark Profilers provide information such as the number\nof function calls, total time spent in the given function, and filename, as well\nas line number to help navigation. That information is essential to exposing\ntight loops in your PySpark programs, and allowing you to make performance\n\nimprovement decisions.\n\n\n**Driver profiling**\n\nPySpark applications run as independent sets of processes on a cluster,\ncoordinated by the SparkContext object in the driver program. On the driver\nside, PySpark is a regular Python process; thus, we can profile it as a normal\nPython program using cProfile as illustrated below:\n\nimport cProfile\n\nwith cProfile.Profile() as pr:\n_# Your code_\n\npr.print_stats()\n\n**Workers profiling**\n\nExecutors are distributed on worker nodes in the cluster, which introduces\ncomplexity because we need to aggregate profiles. Furthermore, a Python worker\nprocess is spawned per executor for PySpark UDF execution, which makes the\nprofiling more intricate.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe UDF profiler, which is introduced in Spark 3.3, overcomes all those obstacles\nand becomes a major tool to profile workers for PySpark applications. We‚Äôll\nillustrate how to use the UDF profiler with a simple Pandas UDF example.\n\nFirstly, a PySpark DataFrame with 8,000 rows is generated, as shown below.\n```\n sdf = spark.range( 0 , 8 * 1000 ).withColumn(\n  'id' , (col( 'id' ) % 8 ). cast ( 'integer' ) # 1000 rows x 8 groups (if group\n by 'id' )\n ).withColumn( 'v' , rand())\n\n```\nLater, we will group by the id column, which results in 8 groups with 1,000 rows\nper group.\n\nThe Pandas UDF plus_one is then created and applied as shown below:\n```\n import pandas as pd\n def plus_one ( pdf: pd.DataFrame ) -> pd.DataFrame:\n   return pdf.apply( lambda x: x + 1 , axis= 1 )\n res = sdf.groupby( \"id\" ).applyInPandas(plus_one, schema=sdf.schema)\n res.collect()\n\n```\n\nExecuting the example above and running sc.show_profiles() prints the\nfollowing profile. The profile below can also be dumped to disk by sc.dump_\nprofiles(path).\n\nThe UDF id in the profile (271, highlighted above) matches that in the Spark plan\nfor res. The Spark plan can be shown by calling res.explain() .\n\n\nNote that plus_one takes a pandas DataFrame and returns another pandas\nDataFrame. For each group, all columns are passed together as a pandas\nDataFrame to the plus_one UDF, and the returned pandas DataFrames are\ncombined into a PySpark DataFrame.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe first line in the profile‚Äôs body indicates the total number of calls that were\nmonitored. The column heading includes\n\n**‚Ä¢** ncalls , for the number of calls.\n\n**‚Ä¢** tottime , for the total time spent in the given function (excluding time\nspent in calls to sub-functions)\n\n**‚Ä¢** percall , the quotient of tottime divided by ncalls\n\n**‚Ä¢** cumtime , the cumulative time spent in this and all subfunctions (from\ninvocation till exit)\n\n**‚Ä¢** percall , the quotient of cumtime divided by primitive calls\n\n**‚Ä¢** filename:lineno(function) , which provides the respective information\nfor each function\n\nDigging into the column details: plus_one is triggered once per group, 8 times\nin total; _arith_method of pandas Series is called once per row, 8,000 times\nin total. pandas.DataFrame.apply applies the function lambda x: x + 1 row by\nrow, thus suffering from high invocation overhead.\n\nWe can reduce such overhead by substituting the pandas.DataFrame.apply\nwith pdf + 1, which is vectorized in pandas. The optimized Pandas UDF looks as\nfollows:\n```\n import pandas as pd\n def plus_one_optimized ( pdf: pd.DataFrame ) -> pd.DataFrame:\n   return pdf + 1\n res = sdf.groupby( \"id\" ).applyInPandas(plus_one_optimized, schema=sdf.\n schema)\n res.collect()\n\n```\n\nThe updated profile is as shown below.\n\nWe can summarize the optimizations as follows:\n\n**‚Ä¢** Arithmetic operation from 8,000 calls to 8 calls\n\n**‚Ä¢** Total function calls from 2,898,160 calls to 2,384 calls\n\n**‚Ä¢** Total execution time from 2.300 seconds to 0.004 seconds\n\nThe short example above demonstrates how the UDF profiler helps us deeply\nunderstand the execution, identify the performance bottleneck and enhance\nthe overall performance of the user-defined function.\n\nThe UDF profiler was implemented based on the executor-side profiler,\nwhich is designed for PySpark RDD API. The executor-side profiler is available\nin all active Databricks Runtime versions.\n\n\n-----\n\nBoth the UDF profiler and the executor-side profiler run on Python workers.\nThey are controlled by the spark.python.profile Spark configuration, which\nis false by default. We can enable that Spark configuration on a Databricks\nRuntime cluster as shown below.\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nPySpark profilers are implemented based on cProfile; thus, the profile reporting\nrelies on the [Stats](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#the-stats-class) class. [Spark Accumulators](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html#accumulators) also play an important role when\ncollecting profile reports from Python workers.\n\nPowerful profilers are provided by PySpark in order to identify hot loops and\nsuggest potential improvements. They are easy to use and critical to enhance\nthe performance of PySpark programs. The UDF profiler, which is available\nstarting from Databricks Runtime 11.0 (Spark 3.3), overcomes all the technical\nchallenges and brings insights to user-defined functions.\n\nIn addition, there is an ongoing effort in the Apache Spark‚Ñ¢ open source\ncommunity to introduce memory profiling on executors; see [SPARK-40281](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-40281) for\nmore information.\n\n**Start experimenting with these**\n**free Databricks** **notebooks** **.**\n\n\n-----\n\nSECTION 2.3 \u0007\n\n**Low-Latency Streaming Data Pipelines With Delta Live Tables**\n**and Apache Kafka**\n\nby **F R A N K M U N Z**\n\nAugust 9, 2022\n\n\n[Delta Live Tables (DLT)](https://databricks.com/product/delta-live-tables) is the first ETL framework that uses a simple declarative\napproach for creating reliable data pipelines and fully manages the underlying\ninfrastructure at scale for batch and [streaming data](https://www.databricks.com/product/data-streaming) . Many use cases require\nactionable insights derived from near real-time data. Delta Live Tables enables\nlow-latency streaming data pipelines to support such use cases with low\nlatencies by directly ingesting data from event buses like [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) , [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/)\n[Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/) , [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud) , [Amazon MSK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtU9pb18g5Q) , or [Azure Event Hubs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/) .\n\nThis article will walk through using DLT with Apache Kafka while providing the\nrequired Python code to ingest streams. The recommended system architecture\nwill be explained, and related DLT settings worth considering will be explored\nalong the way.\n\n**Streaming platforms**\n\nEvent buses or message buses decouple message producers from consumers.\nA popular streaming use case is the collection of click-through data from\nusers navigating a website where every user interaction is stored as an event in\n\n\nApache Kafka. The event stream from Kafka is then used for real-time streaming\ndata analytics. Multiple message consumers can read the same data from Kafka\nand use the data to learn about audience interests, conversion rates, and bounce\nreasons. The real-time, streaming event data from the user interactions often\nalso needs to be correlated with actual purchases stored in a billing database.\n\n**Apache Kafka**\n\n[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is a popular open source event bus. Kafka uses the concept of a\ntopic, an append-only distributed log of events where messages are buffered for\na certain amount of time. Although messages in Kafka are not deleted once they\nare consumed, they are also not stored indefinitely. The message retention for\n\nKafka can be configured per topic and defaults to 7 days. Expired messages will\nbe deleted eventually.\n\nThis article is centered around Apache Kafka; however, the concepts discussed\nalso apply to many other event busses or messaging systems.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Streaming data pipelines**\n\n\nIn a data flow pipeline, Delta Live Tables and their dependencies can be declared\nwith a standard SQL Create Table As Select (CTAS) statement and the DLT\nkeyword ‚Äúlive.‚Äù\n\nWhen developing DLT with Python, the @dlt.table decorator is used to create a\nDelta Live Table. To ensure the data quality in a pipeline, DLT uses [Expectations](https://docs.databricks.com/data-engineering/delta-live-tables/delta-live-tables-expectations.html)\nwhich are simple SQL constraints clauses that define the pipeline‚Äôs behavior with\ninvalid records.\n\nSince streaming workloads often come with unpredictable data volumes,\nDatabricks employs [enhanced autoscaling](https://databricks.com/blog/2022/06/29/delta-live-tables-announces-new-capabilities-and-performance-optimizations.html) for data flow pipelines to minimize the\noverall end-to-end latency while reducing cost by shutting down unnecessary\ninfrastructure.\n\n**Delta Live Tables** are fully recomputed, in the right order, exactly once for each\npipeline run.\n\nIn contrast, **streaming Delta Live Tables** are stateful, incrementally computed\nand only process data that has been added since the last pipeline run. If the\nquery which defines a streaming live tables changes, new data will be processed\nbased on the new query but existing data is not recomputed. Streaming live\ntables always use a streaming source and only work over append-only streams,\nsuch as Kafka, Kinesis, or Auto Loader. Streaming DLTs are based on top of Spark\nStructured Streaming.\n\n\nYou can chain multiple streaming pipelines, for example, workloads with very\nlarge data volume and low latency requirements.\n\n**Direct ingestion from streaming engines**\n\nDelta Live Tables written in Python can directly ingest data from an event bus like\nKafka using Spark Structured Streaming. You can set a short retention period for\nthe Kafka topic to avoid compliance issues, reduce costs and then benefit from\nthe cheap, elastic and governable storage that Delta provides.\n\nAs a first step in the pipeline, we recommend ingesting the data as is to a Bronze\n(raw) table and avoid complex transformations that could drop important data.\nLike any Delta table the Bronze table will retain the history and allow it to perform\nGDPR and other compliance tasks.\n\nIngest streaming data from Apache Kafka\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen writing DLT pipelines in Python, you use the @dlt.table annotation\nto create a DLT table. There is no special attribute to mark streaming DLTs in\nPython; simply use spark.readStream() to access the stream. Example code\nfor creating a DLT table with the name kafka_bronze that is consuming data\nfrom a Kafka topic looks as follows:\n\nimport dlt\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import - \nfrom pyspark.sql.types import - \n\nTOPIC = \"tracker-events\"\nKAFKA_BROKER = spark.conf.get( \"KAFKA_SERVER\" )\n_# subscribe to TOPIC at KAFKA_BROKER_\nraw_kafka_events = (spark.readStream\n. format ( \"kafka\" )\n.option( \"subscribe\" , TOPIC)\n.option( \"kafka.bootstrap.servers\" , KAFKA_BROKER)\n.option( \"startingOffsets\" , \"earliest\" )\n.load()\n)\n\n**@dlt.table(table_properties={** **\"pipelines.reset.allowed\"** **:** **\"false\"** **})**\n```\n def kafka_bronze ():\n\n```\nreturn raw_kafka_events\n\npipelines.reset.allowed\n\nNote that event buses typically expire messages after a certain period of time,\nwhereas Delta is designed for infinite retention.\n\nThis might lead to the effect that source data on Kafka has already been deleted\nwhen running a full refresh for a DLT pipeline. In this case, not all historic data\ncould be backfilled from the messaging platform, and data would be missing in\nDLT tables. To prevent dropping data, use the following DLT table property:\n\n\npipelines.reset.allowed=false\n\nSetting pipelines.reset.allowed to false prevents refreshes to the table but\ndoes not prevent incremental writes to the tables or new data from flowing into\nthe table.\n\n**Checkpointing**\n\nIf you are an experienced Spark Structured Streaming developer, you will notice\nthe absence of checkpointing in the above code. In Spark Structured Streaming\ncheckpointing is required to persist progress information about what data has\nbeen successfully processed and upon failure, this metadata is used to restart a\nfailed query exactly where it left off.\n\nWhereas checkpoints are necessary for failure recovery with exactly-once\nguarantees in Spark Structured Streaming, DLT handles state automatically\nwithout any manual configuration or explicit checkpointing required.\n\n**Mixing SQL and Python for a DLT pipeline**\n\nA DLT pipeline can consist of multiple notebooks but one DLT notebook is\nrequired to be written entirely in either SQL or Python (unlike other Databricks\nnotebooks where you can have cells of different languages in a single notebook).\n\nNow, if your preference is SQL, you can code the data ingestion from Apache\nKafka in one notebook in Python and then implement the transformation logic of\nyour data pipelines in another notebook in SQL.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Schema mapping**\n\nWhen reading data from messaging platform, the data stream is opaque and a\nschema has to be provided.\n\nThe Python example below shows the schema definition of events from a fitness\ntracker, and how the value part of the [Kafka message is mapped](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/structured-streaming/kafka.html) to that schema.\n\nevent_schema = StructType([ \\\nStructField( \"time\" , TimestampType(), True )   , \\\nStructField( \"version\" , StringType(), True ), \\\nStructField( \"model\" , StringType(), True )   , \\\nStructField( \"heart_bpm\" , IntegerType(), True ), \\\nStructField( \"kcal\" , IntegerType(), True )    \\\n])\n\n_# temporary table, visible in pipeline but not in data browser,_\n_# cannot be queried interactively_\n**@dlt.table(comment=** **\"real schema for Kakfa payload\"** **,**\n**temporary=** **True** **)**\n```\n def kafka_silver ():\n\n```\nreturn (\n_# kafka streams are (timestamp,value)_\n_# value contains the kafka payload_\n\ndlt.read_stream( \"kafka_bronze\" )\n.select(col( \"timestamp\" ),from_json(col( \"value\" )\n.cast( \"string\" ), event_schema).alias( \"event\" ))\n.select( \"timestamp\" , \"event.*\" )\n\n\n**Benefits**\n\nReading streaming data in DLT directly from a message broker minimizes the\narchitectural complexity and provides lower end-to-end latency since data is\ndirectly streamed from the messaging broker and no intermediary step is involved.\n\n**Streaming ingest with cloud object store intermediary**\n\nFor some specific use cases, you may want to offload data from Apache Kafka,\ne.g., using a Kafka connector, and store your streaming data in a cloud object\nintermediary. In a Databricks workspace, the cloud vendor-specific objectstore can then be mapped via the Databricks Files System (DBFS) as a cloudindependent folder. Once the data is offloaded, [Databricks Auto Loader](https://docs.databricks.com/ingestion/auto-loader/index.html) can\ningest the files.\n\nAuto Loader can ingest data with a single line of SQL code. The syntax to ingest\nJSON files into a DLT table is shown below (it is wrapped across two lines for\nreadability).\n\n_-- INGEST with Auto Loader_\ncreate or replace streaming live table raw\nas select `*` FROM cloud_files(\"dbfs:/data/twitter\", \"json\")\n\n\n-----\n\nNote that Auto Loader itself is a streaming data source and all newly arrived files\nwill be processed exactly once, hence the streaming keyword for the raw table\nthat indicates data is ingested incrementally to that table.\n\nSince offloading streaming data to a cloud object store introduces an additional\nstep in your system architecture it will also increase the end-to-end latency\nand create additional storage costs. Keep in mind that the Kafka connector\nwriting event data to the cloud object store needs to be managed, increasing\noperational complexity.\n\nTherefore Databricks recommends as a best practice to directly access event\nbus data from DLT using [Spark Structured Streaming](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/08/09/low-latency-streaming-data-pipelines-with-delta-live-tables-and-apache-kafka.html#described) as described above.\n\n**Other event buses or messaging systems**\n\nThis article is centered around Apache Kafka; however, the concepts discussed\nalso apply to other event buses or messaging systems. DLT supports any data\nsource that Databricks Runtime directly supports.\n\n**Amazon Kinesis**\nIn Kinesis, you write messages to a fully managed serverless stream. Same as\nKafka, Kinesis does not permanently store messages. The default message\nretention in Kinesis is one day.\n\nWhen using Amazon Kinesis, replace format(‚Äúkafka‚Äù) with format(‚Äúkinesis‚Äù) in the\nPython code for streaming ingestion above and add Amazon Kinesis-specific\nsettings with option(). For more information, check the section about Kinesis\nIntegration in the Spark Structured Streaming documentation.\n\n\n**Azure Event Hubs**\n\nFor Azure Event Hubs settings, check the official [documentation at Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-kafka-spark-tutorial) and\nthe article [Delta Live Tables recipes: Consuming from Azure Event Hubs](https://alexott.blogspot.com/2022/06/delta-live-tables-recipes-consuming.html) .\n\n**Summary**\n\nDLT is much more than just the ‚ÄúT‚Äù in ETL. With DLT, you can easily ingest from\nstreaming and batch sources, cleanse and transform data on the Databricks\nLakehouse Platform on any cloud with guaranteed data quality.\n\nData from Apache Kafka can be ingested by directly connecting to a Kafka broker\nfrom a DLT notebook in Python. Data loss can be prevented for a full pipeline\nrefresh even when the source data in the Kafka streaming layer expired.\n\n**Get started**\n\nIf you are a Databricks customer, simply follow the [guide to get started](https://www.databricks.com/discover/pages/getting-started-with-delta-live-tables) .

Streaming pipelines are no\ndifferent in this regard; in this blog we present some of the most important\nconsiderations for deploying streaming pipelines and applications to a\nproduction environment.\n\nAt Databricks, we offer two different ways of building and running streaming\npipelines and applications ‚Äî [Delta Live Tables (DLT)](https://www.databricks.com/product/delta-live-tables) and [Databricks Workflows](https://www.databricks.com/product/workflows) .\nDLT is our flagship, fully managed ETL product that supports both batch and\nstreaming pipelines. It offers declarative development, automated operations,\ndata quality, advanced observability capabilities, and more. Workflows enable\ncustomers to run Apache Spark‚Ñ¢ workloads in Databricks‚Äô optimized runtime\nenvironment (i.e., Photon) with access to unified governance (Unity Catalog) and\nstorage (Delta Lake). Regarding streaming workloads, both DLT and Workflows\n\nshare the same core streaming engine ‚Äî Spark Structured Streaming. In the\ncase of DLT, customers program against the DLT API and DLT uses the Structured\nStreaming engine under the hood. In the case of Jobs, customers program\nagainst the Spark API directly.\n\n\nThe recommendations in this blog post are written from the Structured\nStreaming engine perspective, most of which apply to both DLT and Workflows\n(although DLT does take care of some of these automatically, like Triggers and\nCheckpoints). We group the recommendations under the headings ‚ÄúBefore\nDeployment‚Äù and ‚ÄúAfter Deployment‚Äù to highlight when these concepts will\nneed to be applied and are releasing this blog series with this split between\nthe two. There will be additional deep-dive content for some of the sections\nbeyond as well. We recommend reading all sections before beginning work\nto productionalize a streaming pipeline or application, and revisiting these\nrecommendations as you promote it from dev to QA and eventually production.\n\n**Before deployment**\n\nThere are many things you need to consider when creating your streaming\napplication to improve the production experience. Some of these topics, like\nunit testing, checkpoints, triggers, and state management, will determine how\nyour streaming application performs. Others, like naming conventions and how\nmany streams to run on which clusters, have more to do with managing multiple\nstreaming applications in the same environment.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Unit testing**\n\n\nThe cost associated with finding and fixing a bug goes up exponentially\nthe farther along you get in the SDLC process, and a Structured Streaming\napplication is no different. When you‚Äôre turning that prototype into a hardened\nproduction pipeline you need a CI/CD process with built-in tests. So how do you\ncreate those tests?\n\nAt first you might think that unit testing a streaming pipeline requires something\nspecial, but that isn‚Äôt the case. The general guidance for streaming pipelines is\nno different than [guidance you may have heard for Spark batch jobs](https://docs.databricks.com/notebooks/testing.html) . It starts by\norganizing your code so that it can be unit tested effectively:\n\n**‚Ä¢** Divide your code into testable chunks\n\n**‚Ä¢** Organize your business logic into functions calling other functions.\nIf you have a lot of logic in a [foreachBatch](https://docs.databricks.com/structured-streaming/foreach.html) or you‚Äôve implemented\n[mapGroupsWithState](https://docs.databricks.com/structured-streaming/initial-state-map-groups-with-state.html) or flatMapGroupsWithState, organize that code into\nmultiple functions that can be individually tested.\n\n**‚Ä¢** Do not code in dependencies on the global state or external systems\n\n**‚Ä¢** Any function manipulating a DataFrame or data set should be organized\nto take the DataFrame/data set/configuration as input and output the\nDataFrame/data set\n\nOnce your code is separated out in a logical manner you can implement unit\ntests for each of your functions. Spark-agnostic functions can be tested like any\nother function in that language. For testing UDFs and functions with DataFrames\nand data sets, there are multiple Spark testing frameworks available. These\n\n\nframeworks support all of the DataFrame/data set APIs so that you can easily\ncreate input, and they have specialized assertions that allow you to compare\nDataFrame content and schemas. Some examples are:\n\n**‚Ä¢** The built-in Spark test suite, designed to test all parts of Spark\n\n**‚Ä¢** spark-testing-base, which has support for both Scala and Python\n\n**‚Ä¢** spark-fast-tests, for testing Scala Spark 2 & 3\n\n**‚Ä¢** chispa, a Python version of spark-fast-tests\n\nCode examples for each of these libraries can be found [here](https://github.com/alexott/spark-playground/tree/master/testing) .\n\nBut wait! I‚Äôm testing a streaming application here ‚Äî don‚Äôt I need to make\nstreaming DataFrames for my unit tests? The answer is no; you do not! Even\nthough a streaming DataFrame represents a data set with no defined ending,\nwhen functions are executed on it they are executed on a microbatch ‚Äî a\ndiscrete set of data. You can use the same unit tests that you would use for a\nbatch application, for both stateless and stateful streams. One of the advantages\nof Structured Streaming over other frameworks is the ability to use the same\ntransformation code for both streaming and with other batch operations for\nthe same sink. This allows you to simplify some operations, like backfilling\ndata, for example, where rather than trying to sync the logic between two\ndifferent applications, you can just modify the input sources and write to the\nsame destination. If the sink is a Delta table, you can even do these operations\nconcurrently if both processes are append-only operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Triggers**\n\n\nprocess a microbatch in order to maximize resource utilization, but setting the\ninterval longer would make sense if your stream is running on a shared cluster\nand you don‚Äôt want it to constantly take the cluster resources.\n\nIf you do not need your stream to run continuously, either because data doesn‚Äôt\ncome that often or your SLA is 10 minutes or greater, then you can use the\nTrigger.Once option. This option will start up the stream, check for anything new\nsince the last time it ran, process it all in one big batch, and then shut down.\nJust like with a continuously running stream when using Trigger.Once, the\ncheckpoint that guarantees fault tolerance (see below) will guarantee exactlyonce processing.\n\nSpark has a new version of Trigger.Once called Trigger.AvailableNow. While\nTrigger.Once will process everything in one big batch, which depending on your\ndata size may not be ideal, Trigger.AvailableNow will split up the data based on\nmaxFilesPerTrigger and maxBytesPerTrigger settings. This allows the data to be\nprocessed in multiple batches. Those settings are ignored with Trigger.Once.\nYou can see examples for setting triggers [here](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html#triggers) .\n\n**Pop quiz ‚Äî** how do you turn your streaming process into a batch process\nthat automatically keeps track of where it left off with just one line of code?\n\n**Answer ‚Äî** change your processing time trigger to Trigger.Once/Trigger.\nAvailableNow! Exact same code, running on a schedule, that will neither miss nor\nreprocess any records.\n\n\nNow that you know your code works, you need to determine how often your\nstream will look for new data. This is where [triggers](https://docs.databricks.com/structured-streaming/triggers.html) come in. Setting a trigger is\none of the options for the writeStream command, and it looks like this:\n\n_// Scala/Java_\n.trigger(Trigger.ProcessingTime( \"30 seconds\" ))\n\n_# Python_\n.trigger(processingTime= '30 seconds' )\n\nIn the above example, if a microbatch completes in less than 30 seconds,\nthen the engine will wait for the rest of the time before kicking off the next\nmicrobatch. If a microbatch takes longer than 30 seconds to complete, then the\nengine will start the next microbatch immediately after the previous one finishes.\n\nThe two factors you should consider when setting your trigger interval are how\nlong you expect your stream to process a microbatch and how often you want\nthe system to check for new data. You can lower the overall processing latency\nby using a shorter trigger interval and increasing the resources available for\nthe streaming query by adding more workers or using compute or memory\noptimized instances tailored to your application‚Äôs performance. These increased\nresources come with increased costs, so if your goal is to minimize costs, then a\nlonger trigger interval with less compute can work. Normally you would not set a\ntrigger interval longer than what it would typically take for your stream to\n\n\n-----\n\n**Name your stream**\n\n\nYou name your children, you name your pets, now it‚Äôs time to name your streams.\nThere‚Äôs a writeStream option called .queryName that allows you to provide a\nfriendly name for your stream. Why bother? Well, suppose you don‚Äôt name it. In\nthat case, all you‚Äôll have to go on in the Structured Streaming tab in the Spark UI\nis the string <no name> and the unintelligible guid that is automatically generated\nas the stream‚Äôs unique identifier. If you have more than one stream running on a\ncluster, and all of them have <no name> and unintelligible strings as identifiers,\nhow do you find the one you want? If you‚Äôre exporting metrics how do you tell\nwhich is which?\n\nMake it easy on yourself, and name your streams. When you‚Äôre managing them in\nproduction you‚Äôll be glad you did, and while you‚Äôre at it, go and name your batch\nqueries in any foreachBatch() code you have.\n\n**Fault tolerance**\n\nHow does your stream recover from being shut down? There are a few different\ncases where this can come into play, like cluster node failures or intentional\nhalts, but the solution is to set up checkpointing. Checkpoints with write-ahead\nlogs provide a degree of protection from your streaming application being\ninterrupted, ensuring it will be able to pick up again where it last left off.\n\nCheckpoints store the current offsets and state values (e.g., aggregate values) for\nyour stream. Checkpoints are stream specific so each should be set to its own\nlocation. Doing this will let you recover more gracefully from shutdowns, failures\nfrom your application code or unexpected cloud provider failures or limitations.\n\n\nTo configure checkpoints, add the checkpointLocation option to your stream\ndefinition:\n\n_// Scala/Java/Python_\nstreamingDataFrame.writeStream\n.format( \"delta\" )\n.option( \"path\" , \"\" )\n.queryName( \"TestStream\" )\n.option( \"checkpointLocation\" , \"\" )\n.start()\n\nTo keep it simple ‚Äî every time you call .writeStream, you must specify the\ncheckpoint option with a unique checkpoint location. Even if you‚Äôre using\nforeachBatch and the writeStream itself doesn‚Äôt specify a path or table option,\nyou must still specify that checkpoint. It‚Äôs how Spark Structured Streaming gives\nyou hassle-free fault tolerance.\n\nEfforts to manage the checkpointing in your stream should be of little concern\nin general. As [Tathagata Das has said](https://youtu.be/rl8dIzTpxrI?t=454) , ‚ÄúThe simplest way to perform streaming\nanalytics is not having to reason about streaming at all.‚Äù That said, one setting\n\ndeserves mention as questions around the maintenance of checkpoint files\ncome up occasionally. Though it is an internal setting that doesn‚Äôt require direct\nconfiguration, the setting spark.sql.streaming.minBatchesToRetain (default 100)\ncontrols the number of checkpoint files that get created. Basically, the number\nof files will be roughly this number times two, as there is a file created noting the\noffsets at the beginning of the batch (offsets, a.k.a write ahead logs) and another\non completing the batch (commits). The number of files is checked periodically\nfor cleanup as part of the internal processes. This simplifies at least one aspect\nof long-term streaming application maintenance for you.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt is also important to note that some changes to your application code can\ninvalidate the checkpoint. Checking for any of these changes during code\nreviews before deployment is recommended. You can find examples of changes\nwhere this can happen in [Recovery Semantics after Changes in a Streaming](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html#recovery-semantics-after-changes-in-a-streaming-query)\n[Query](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html#recovery-semantics-after-changes-in-a-streaming-query) . Suppose you want to look at checkpointing in more detail or consider\nwhether asynchronous checkpointing might improve the latency in your\nstreaming application. In that case, these are covered in greater depth in\n[Speed Up Streaming Queries With Asynchronous State Checkpointing](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/05/02/speed-up-streaming-queries-with-asynchronous-state-checkpointing.html) .\n\n**State management and RocksDB**\n\nStateful streaming applications are those where current records may depend\non previous events, so Spark has to retain data in between microbatches.\nThe data it retains is called state, and Spark will store it in a state store and\nread, update and delete it during each microbatch. Typical stateful operations\nare streaming aggregations, streaming dropDuplicates, stream-stream joins,\nmapGroupsWithState, or flatMapGroupsWithState. Some common types of\nexamples where you‚Äôll need to think about your application state could be\nsessionization or hourly aggregation using group by methods to calculate\n\nbusiness metrics. Each record in the state store is identified by a key that is used\nas part of the stateful computation, and the more unique keys that are required\nthe larger the amount of state data that will be stored.\n\nWhen the amount of state data needed to enable these stateful operations\ngrows large and complex, it can degrade your workloads‚Äô performance, leading\nto increased latency or even failures. A typical indicator of the state store being\n\n\nthe culprit of added latency is large amounts of time spent in garbage collection\n(GC) pauses in the JVM. If you are monitoring the microbatch processing time,\nthis could look like a continual increase or wildly varying processing time across\nmicrobatches.\n\nThe default configuration for a state store, which is sufficient for most general\nstreaming workloads, is to store the state data in the executors‚Äô JVM memory.\nLarge number of keys (typically millions, see the Monitoring & Instrumentation\nsection in part 2 of this blog) can add excessive memory pressure on the\nmachine memory and increase the frequency of hitting these GC pauses as it\ntries to free up resources.\n\nOn the Databricks Runtime (now also supported in [Apache Spark 3.2+](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html#rocksdb-state-store-implementation) ) you can\nuse [RocksDB](http://rocksdb.org/) as an alternative state store provider to alleviate this source of\nmemory pressure. RocksDB is an embeddable persistent key-value store for fast\nstorage. It features high performance through a log-structured database engine\nwritten entirely in C++ and optimized for fast, low-latency storage.\n\nLeveraging RocksDB as the state store provider still uses machine memory\nbut no longer occupies space in the JVM and makes for a more efficient\nstate management system for large amounts of keys. This doesn‚Äôt come for\nfree, however, as it introduces an extra step in processing every microbatch.\nIntroducing RocksDB shouldn‚Äôt be expected to reduce latency except when it is\nrelated to memory pressure from state data storage in the JVM. The RocksDBbacked state store still provides the same degree of fault tolerance as the\nregular state storage as it is included in the stream checkpointing.\n\n\n-----\n\nRocksDB configuration, like checkpoint configuration, is minimal by design and so\nyou only need to declare it in your overall Spark configuration:\n\nspark.conf. set (\n\"spark.sql.streaming.stateStore.providerClass\" ,\n\"com.databricks.sql.streaming.state.RocksDBStateStoreProvider\" )\n\nIf you are monitoring your stream using the streamingQueryListener class, then\nyou will also notice that RocksDB metrics will be included in the stateOperators\nfield. For more detailed information on this see the [RocksDB State Store Metrics](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/structured-streaming/production.html#rocksdb-state-store-metrics)\n[section](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/structured-streaming/production.html#rocksdb-state-store-metrics) of ‚ÄúStructured Streaming in Production.‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs worth noting that large numbers of keys can have other adverse impacts in\naddition to raising memory consumption, especially with unbounded or nonexpiring state keys. With or without RocksDB, the state from the application\nalso gets backed up in checkpoints for fault tolerance. So it makes sense that\nif you have state files being created so that they will not expire, you will keep\naccumulating files in the checkpoint, increasing the amount of storage required\nand potentially the time to write it or recover from failures as well. For the data\nin memory (see the Monitoring & Instrumentation section in part 2 of this blog)\n\nthis situation can lead to somewhat vague out-of-memory errors, and for the\ncheckpointed data written to cloud storage you might observe unexpected\nand unreasonable growth. Unless you have a business need to retain streaming\nstate for all the data that has been processed (and that is rare), read the [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html)\n[Structured Streaming documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html) and make sure to implement your stateful\noperations so that the system can drop state records that are no longer needed\n(pay close attention to dropDuplicates and stream-stream joins).\n\n\n**Running multiple streams on a cluster**\n\nOnce your streams are fully tested and configured, it‚Äôs time to figure out how to\norganize them in production. It‚Äôs a common pattern to stack multiple streams on\nthe same Spark cluster to maximize resource utilization and save cost. This is fine\nto a point, but there are limits to how much you can add to one cluster before\nperformance is affected. The driver has to manage all of the streams running on\nthe cluster, and all streams will compete for the same cores across the workers.\nYou need to understand what your streams are doing and plan your capacity\nappropriately to stack effectively.\n\nHere is what you should take into account when you‚Äôre planning on stacking\nmultiple streams on the same cluster:\n\n**‚Ä¢** Make sure your driver is big enough to manage all of your streams. Is your\ndriver struggling with a high CPU utilization and garbage collection? That\nmeans it‚Äôs struggling to manage all of your streams. Either reduce the\nnumber of streams or increase the size of your driver.\n\n**‚Ä¢** Consider the amount of data each stream is processing. The more data\nyou are ingesting and writing to a sink, the more cores you will need in\norder to maximize your throughput for each stream. You‚Äôll need to reduce\nthe number of streams or increase the number of workers depending on\nhow much data is being processed. For sources like Kafka you will need to\nconfigure how many cores are being used to ingest with the minPartitions\noption if you don‚Äôt have enough cores for all of the partitions across all of\nyour streams.\n\n\n-----\n\n**‚Ä¢** Consider the complexity and data volume of your streams. If all of the\nstreams are doing minimal manipulation and just appending to a sink, then\neach stream will need fewer resources per microbatch and you‚Äôll be able to\nstack more. If the streams are doing stateful processing or computation/\nmemory-intensive operations, that will require more resources for good\nperformance and you‚Äôll want to stack fewer streams.\n\n**‚Ä¢** Consider [scheduler pools](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/job-scheduling.html#fair-scheduler-pools) . When stacking streams they will all be\ncontending for the same workers and cores, and one stream that needs a\nlot of cores will cause the other streams to wait. Scheduler pools enable\nyou to have different streams execute on different parts of the cluster.\nThis will enable streams to execute in parallel with a subset of the available\nresources.\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSome of the ideas we‚Äôve addressed here certainly deserve their own time\nand special treatment with a more in-depth discussion, which you can look\nforward to in later deep dives. However, we hope these recommendations are\nuseful as you begin your journey or seek to enhance your production streaming\nexperience.

Here we discuss the ‚ÄúAfter Deployment‚Äù\nconsiderations for a Structured Streaming Pipeline. The majority of the\nsuggestions in this post are relevant to both Structured Streaming Jobs and\nDelta Live Tables (our flagship and fully managed ETL product that supports\nboth batch and streaming pipelines).\n\n**After deployment**\n\nAfter the deployment of your streaming application, there are typically three\nmain things you‚Äôll want to know:\n\n**‚Ä¢** How is my application running?\n\n**‚Ä¢** Are resources being used efficiently?\n\n**‚Ä¢** How do I manage any problems that come up?\n\nWe‚Äôll start with an introduction to these topics, followed by a deeper dive later in\nthis blog series.\n\n\n**Monitoring and instrumentation (How is my application running?)**\n\nStreaming workloads should be pretty much hands-off once deployed to\nproduction. However, one thing that may sometimes come to mind is: ‚Äúhow is my\napplication running?‚Äù Monitoring applications can take on different levels and\nforms depending on:\n\n**‚Ä¢** the metrics collected for your application (batch duration/latency,\nthroughput, ‚Ä¶)\n\n**‚Ä¢** where you want to monitor the application from\n\nAt the simplest level, there is a streaming dashboard ( [A Look at the New](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2020/07/29/a-look-at-the-new-structured-streaming-ui-in-apache-spark-3-0.html)\n[Structured Streaming UI](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2020/07/29/a-look-at-the-new-structured-streaming-ui-in-apache-spark-3-0.html) ) and built-in logging directly in the Spark UI that can be\nused in a variety of situations.\n\nThis is in addition to setting up failure alerts on jobs running streaming\nworkloads.\n\nIf you want more fine-grained metrics or to create custom actions based on\nthese metrics as part of your code base, then the StreamingQueryListener is\nbetter aligned with what you‚Äôre looking for.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf you want the Spark metrics to be reported (including machine level traces for\ndrivers or workers) you should use the platform‚Äôs [metrics sink](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html#metrics) .\n\nThe Apache Spark Structured Streaming UI\n\n\nAnother point to consider is where you want to surface these metrics for\nobservability. There is a Ganglia dashboard at the cluster level, integrated partner\napplications like [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/databricks-monitoring-datadog/) for monitoring streaming workloads, or even more open\nsource options you can build using tools like Prometheus and Grafana. Each\nhas advantages and disadvantages to consider around cost, performance, and\nmaintenance requirements.\n\nWhether you have low volumes of streaming workloads where interactions in the\nUI are sufficient or have decided to invest in a more robust monitoring platform,\nyou should know how to observe your production streaming workloads. Further\n‚ÄúMonitoring and Alerting‚Äù posts later in this series will contain a more thorough\ndiscussion. In particular, we‚Äôll see different measures on which to monitor\nstreaming applications and then later take a deeper look at some of the tools\nyou can leverage for observability.\n\n**Application optimization (Are resources being used effectively?**\n\n**Think ‚Äúcost‚Äù)**\n\nThe next concern we have after deploying to production is ‚Äúis my application\n\nusing resources effectively?‚Äù As developers, we understand (or quickly learn) the\ndistinction between working code and well-written code. Improving the way your\ncode runs is usually very satisfying, but what ultimately matters is the overall\ncost of running it. Cost considerations for Structured Streaming applications will\nbe largely similar to those for other Spark applications. One notable difference\nis that failing to optimize for production workloads can be extremely costly,\nas these workloads are frequently ‚Äúalways-on‚Äù applications, and thus wasted\nexpenditure can quickly compound. Because assistance with cost optimization is\n\n\n-----\n\nfrequently requested, a separate post in this series will address it. The key points\nthat we‚Äôll focus on will be efficiency of usage and sizing.\n\nGetting the cluster sizing right is one of the most significant differences between\nefficiency and wastefulness in streaming applications. This can be particularly\ntricky because in some cases it‚Äôs difficult to estimate the full load conditions of\nthe application in production before it‚Äôs actually there. In other cases, it may be\ndifficult due to natural variations in volume handled throughout the day, week, or\nyear. When first deploying, it can be beneficial to oversize slightly, incurring the\nextra expense to avoid inducing performance bottlenecks. Utilize the monitoring\ntools you chose to employ after the cluster has been running for a few weeks\nto ensure proper cluster utilization. For example, are CPU and memory levels\nbeing used at a high level during peak load or is the load generally small and the\ncluster may be downsized? Maintain regular monitoring of this and keep an eye\nout for changes in data volume over time; if either occurs, a cluster resize may be\nrequired to maintain cost-effective operation.\n\nAs a general guideline, you should avoid excessive shuffle operations, joins, or an\nexcessive or extreme watermark threshold (don‚Äôt exceed your needs), as each\ncan increase the number of resources you need to run your application. A large\nwatermark threshold will cause Structured Streaming to keep more data in the\nstate store between batches, leading to an increase in memory requirements\nacross the cluster. Also, pay attention to the type of VM configured ‚Äî are you\nusing memory-optimized for your memory-intense stream? Compute-optimized\nfor your computationally-intensive stream? If not, look at the utilization levels\nfor each and consider trying a machine type that could be a better fit. Newer\nfamilies of servers from cloud providers with more optimal CPUs often lead to\nfaster execution, meaning you might need fewer of them to meet your SLA.\n\n\n**Troubleshooting (How do I manage any problems that come up?)**\n\nThe last question we ask ourselves after deployment is ‚Äúhow do I manage any\nproblems that come up?‚Äù As with cost optimization, troubleshooting streaming\napplications in Spark often looks the same as other applications since most of\nthe mechanics remain the same under the hood. For streaming applications,\nissues usually fall into two categories ‚Äî failure scenarios and latency scenarios\n\n**Failure scenarios**\n\nFailure scenarios typically manifest with the stream stopping with an error,\nexecutors failing or a driver failure causing the whole cluster to fail. Common\ncauses for this are:\n\n**‚Ä¢** Too many streams running on the same cluster, causing the driver to be\noverwhelmed. On Databricks, this can be seen in Ganglia, where the driver\nnode will show up as overloaded before the cluster fails.\n\n**‚Ä¢** Too few workers in a cluster or a worker size with too small of a core-tomemory ratio, causing executors to fail with an Out Of Memory error.\nThis can also be seen on Databricks in Ganglia before an executor fails,\nor in the Spark UI under the executors tab.\n\n**‚Ä¢** Using a collect to send too much data to the driver, causing it to fail\nwith an Out Of Memory error.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Latency scenarios**\n\nFor latency scenarios, your stream will not execute as fast as you want or expect.\nA latency issue can be intermittent or constant. Too many streams or too small\nof a cluster can be the cause of this as well. Some other common causes are:\n\n**‚Ä¢** Data skew ‚Äî when a few tasks end up with much more data than the rest\nof the tasks. With skewed data, these tasks take longer to execute than the\nothers, often spilling to disk. Your stream can only run as fast as its slowest\ntask.\n\n**‚Ä¢** Executing a stateful query without defining a watermark or defining a very\nlong one will cause your state to grow very large, slowing down your stream\nover time and potentially leading to failure.\n\n**‚Ä¢** Poorly optimized sink. For example, performing a merge into an overpartitioned Delta table as part of your stream.\n\n**‚Ä¢** Stable but high latency (batch execution time). Depending on the cause,\nadding more workers to increase the number of cores concurrently available\nfor Spark tasks can help. Increasing the number of input partitions and/or\ndecreasing the load per core through batch size settings can also reduce\nthe latency.\n\nJust like troubleshooting a batch job, you‚Äôll use Ganglia to check cluster\nutilization and the Spark UI to find performance bottlenecks. There is a\nspecific [Structured Streaming tab](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2020/07/29/a-look-at-the-new-structured-streaming-ui-in-apache-spark-3-0.html) in the Spark UI created to help monitor and\ntroubleshoot streaming applications. On that tab each stream that is running will\nbe listed, and you‚Äôll see either your stream name if you named your stream or\n\n\n<no name> if you didn‚Äôt. You‚Äôll also see a stream ID that will be visible on the Jobs\ntab of the Spark UI so that you can tell which jobs are for a given stream.\n\nYou‚Äôll notice above we said which jobs are for a given stream. It‚Äôs a common\nmisconception that if you were to look at a streaming application in the Spark\nUI you would just see one job in the Jobs tab running continuously. Instead,\ndepending on your code, you will see one or more jobs that start and complete\nfor each microbatch. Each job will have the stream ID from the Structured\nStreaming tab and a microbatch number in the description, so you‚Äôll be able to\ntell which jobs go with which stream. You can click into those jobs to find the\nlongest running stages and tasks, check for disk spills, and search by Job ID in\nthe SQL tab to find the slowest queries and check their explain plans.\n\nThe Jobs tab in the Apache Spark UI\n\n\n-----\n\nIf you click on your stream in the Structured Streaming tab you‚Äôll see how much\ntime the different streaming operations are taking for each microbatch, such as\nadding a batch, query planning and committing (see earlier screenshot of the\nApache Spark Structured Streaming UI). You can also see how many rows are\nbeing processed as well as the size of your state store for a stateful stream.\nThis can give insights into where potential latency issues are.\n\nWe will go more in-depth with troubleshooting later in this blog series, where\nwe‚Äôll look at some of the causes and remedies for both failure scenarios and\nlatency scenarios as we outlined above.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nYou may have noticed that many of the topics covered here are very similar to\nhow other production Spark applications should be deployed. Whether your\nworkloads are primarily streaming applications or batch processes, the majority\nof the same principles will apply. We focused more on things that become\nespecially important when building out streaming applications, but as we‚Äôre\n\n\nsure you‚Äôve noticed by now, the topics we discussed should be included in\nmost production deployments.\n\nAcross the majority of industries in the world today information is needed\nfaster than ever, but that won‚Äôt be a problem for you. With Spark Structured\nStreaming you‚Äôre set to make it happen at scale in production. Be on the lookout\nfor more in-depth discussions on some of the topics we‚Äôve covered in this blog,\nand in the meantime keep streaming!\n\n**[Review Databricks Structured Streaming in](https://docs.databricks.com/structured-streaming/production.html)**\n**[Production Documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/structured-streaming/production.html)**\n\n**Start experimenting with these**\n**free Databricks** **notebooks** **.**\n\n\n-----\n\nSECTION 2.6 \u0007\n\n**Building Geospatial Data Products**\n\nby **M I L O S C O L I C**\n\nJanuary 6, 2023\n\n\nGeospatial data has been driving innovation for centuries, through use of\nmaps, cartography and more recently through digital content. For example,\nthe oldest map has been found etched in a piece of mammoth tusk and dates\n[approximately 25,000 BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cartography) . This makes geospatial data one of the oldest data\nsources used by society to make decisions. A more recent example, labeled\nas the birth of spatial analysis, is that of Charles Picquet in 1832 who used\ngeospatial data to analyze [Cholera outbreaks in Paris](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k842918.image) ; a couple of decades\nlater John Snow in 1854 followed the same approach for [Cholera outbreaks in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak)\n[London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak) . These two individuals used geospatial data to solve one of the toughest\nproblems of their times and in effect save countless lives. Fast-forwarding to the\n20th century, the concept of [Geographic Information Systems (GIS)](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/geographic-information-system-gis) was [first](https://gisandscience.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/3-an-introduction-to-the-geo-information-system-of-the-canada-land-inventory.pdf)\n[introduced](https://gisandscience.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/3-an-introduction-to-the-geo-information-system-of-the-canada-land-inventory.pdf) in 1967 in Ottawa, Canada, by the Department of Forestry and\nRural Development.\n\nToday we are in the midst of the cloud computing industry revolution ‚Äî\nsupercomputing scale available to any organization, virtually infinitely scalable\nfor both storage and compute. Concepts like [data mesh](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/10/19/building-data-mesh-based-databricks-lakehouse-part-2.html) and [data marketplace](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/06/28/introducing-databricks-marketplace-an-open-marketplace-for-all-data-and-ai-assets.html)\nare emerging within the data community to address questions like platform\nfederation and interoperability. How can we adopt these concepts to geospatial\ndata, spatial analysis and GIS systems? By adopting the concept of data\nproducts and approaching the design of geospatial data as a product.\n\n\nIn this blog we will provide a point of view on how to design scalable geospatial\ndata products that are modern and robust. We will discuss how Databricks\nLakehouse Platform can be used to unlock the full potential of geospatial\nproducts that are one of the most valuable assets in solving the toughest\nproblems of today and the future.\n\n**What is a data product? And how to design one?**\n\nThe most broad and the most concise definition of a ‚Äúdata product‚Äù was coined\nby DJ Patil (the first U.S. Chief Data Scientist) in _Data Jujitsu: The Art of Turning_\n_Data into Product:_ ‚Äúa product that facilitates an end goal through the use of\ndata.‚Äù The complexity of this definition (as admitted by Patil himself) is needed to\nencapsulate the breadth of possible products, to include dashboards, reports, Excel\n\nspreadsheets, and even CSV extracts shared via emails. You might notice that the\nexamples provided deteriorate rapidly in quality, robustness and governance.\n\nWhat are the concepts that differentiate a successful product versus an\nunsuccessful one? Is it the packaging? Is it the content? Is it the quality of the\ncontent? Or is it only the product adoption in the market? Forbes defines the\n10 must-haves of a successful product. A good framework to summarize this is\nthrough the value pyramid.\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 1: Product value pyramid (source)\n\nThe value pyramid provides a priority on each aspect of the product. Not every\nvalue question we ask about the product carries the same amount of weight. If\nthe output is not useful none of the other aspects matter ‚Äî the output isn‚Äôt really\na product but becomes more of a data pollutant to the pool of useful results.\nLikewise, scalability only matters after simplicity and explainability are addressed.\n\nHow does the value pyramid relate to the data products? Each data output, in\norder to be a data product:\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Should have clear usefulness.** The amount of the data society is\ngenerating is rivaled only by the amount of data pollutants we are\ngenerating. These are outputs lacking clear value and use, much less a\nstrategy for what to do with them.\n\n\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Should be explainable.** With the emergence of AI/ML, explainability has\nbecome even more important for data driven decision-making. Data\nis as good as the metadata describing it. Think of it in terms of food ‚Äî\ntaste does matter, but a more important factor is the nutritional value\nof ingredients.\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Should be simple.** An example of product misuse is using a fork to eat\ncereal instead of using a spoon. Furthermore, simplicity is essential but\nnot sufficient ‚Äî beyond simplicity the products should be intuitive.\nWhenever possible both intended and unintended uses of the data\nshould be obvious.\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Should be scalable.** Data is one of the few resources that grows with\nuse. The more data you process the more data you have. If both inputs\nand outputs of the system are unbounded and ever-growing, then the\nsystem has to be scalable in compute power, storage capacity and\ncompute expressive power. Cloud data platforms like Databricks are in\na unique position to answer for all of the three aspects.\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Should generate habits.** In the data domain we are not concerned\nwith customer retention as is the case for the retail products. However,\nthe value of habit generation is obvious if applied to best practices.\nThe systems and data outputs should exhibit the best practices and\npromote them ‚Äî it should be easier to use the data and the system in\nthe intended way than the opposite.\n\nThe geospatial data should adhere to all the aforementioned aspects ‚Äî any data\nproducts should. On top of this tall order, geospatial data has some specific needs.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Geospatial data standards**\n\n\n\n**‚Ä¢** **‚ÄúAdvocate the understanding and use of geospatial data standards**\n**within other sectors of government.‚Äù** ‚Äî Value pyramid applies to\nthe standards as well ‚Äî concepts like ease of adherence (usefulness/\nsimplicity), purpose of the standard (explainability/usefulness), adoption\n(habit generation) are critical for the value generation of a standard.\n\nA critical tool for achieving the data standards mission is the [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) data\nprinciples:\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Findable** ‚Äî The first step in (re)using data is to find them. Metadata\nand data should be easy to find for both humans and computers.\nMachine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of\ndata sets and services.\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Accessible** ‚Äî Once the user finds the required data, she/he/they\nneed to know how they can be accessed, possibly including\nauthentication and authorization.\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Interoperable** ‚Äî The data usually needs to be integrated with\nother data. In addition, the data needs to interoperate with\napplications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing.\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Reusable** ‚Äî The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimize the reuse of data.\nTo achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that\nthey can be replicated and/or combined in different settings.\n\n\nGeospatial data standards are used to ensure that geographic data is collected,\norganized, and shared in a consistent and reliable way. These standards can\ninclude guidelines for things like data formatting, coordinate systems, map\nprojections, and metadata. Adhering to standards makes it easier to share data\nbetween different organizations, allowing for greater collaboration and broader\naccess to geographic information.\n\nThe Geospatial Commision (UK government) has defined the UK Geospatial\nData Standards Register as a central repository for data standards to be applied\nin the case of geospatial data. Furthermore, the mission of this registry is to:\n\n**‚Ä¢** **‚ÄúEnsure UK geospatial data is more consistent and coherent and usable**\n**across a wider range of systems.‚Äù** ‚Äî These concepts are a callout for the\nimportance of explainability, usefulness and habit generation (possibly\nother aspects of the value pyramid).\n\n**‚Ä¢** **‚ÄúEmpower the UK geospatial community to become more engaged with**\n**the relevant standards and standards bodies.‚Äù** ‚Äî Habit generation within\nthe community is as important as the robust and critical design on the\nstandard. If not adopted standards are useless.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe share the belief that the FAIR principles are crucial for the design of scalable\ndata products we can trust. To be fair, FAIR is based on common sense, so why\nis it key to our considerations? _‚ÄúWhat I see in FAIR is not new in itself, but what it_\n_does well is to articulate, in an accessible way, the need for a holistic approach_\n_to data improvement. This ease in communication is why FAIR is being used_\n_increasingly widely as an umbrella for data improvement ‚Äî and not just in the_\n_geospatial community.‚Äù_ ‚Äî [A FAIR wind sets our course for data improvement](https://geospatialcommission.blog.gov.uk/2022/03/02/a-fair-wind-sets-our-course-for-data-improvement/) .\n\nTo further support this approach, the [Federal Geographic Data Committee](https://www.fgdc.gov/standards) has\ndeveloped the [National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) Strategic Plan](https://www.fgdc.gov/nsdi-plan/nsdi-strategic-plan-2021-2024.pdf) that\ncovers the years 2021-2024 and was approved in November 2020. The goals\nof NSDI are in essence FAIR principles and convey the same message of designing\nsystems that promote the circular economy of data ‚Äî data products that flow\nbetween organizations following common standards and in each step through the\ndata supply chain unlock new value and new opportunities. The fact that these\nprinciples are permeating different jurisdictions and are adopted across different\nregulators is a testament to the robustness and soundness of the approach.\n\n\nThe FAIR concepts weave really well together with the data product design.\nIn fact FAIR is traversing the whole product value pyramid and forms a value\ncycle. By adopting both the value pyramid and FAIR principles we design data\nproducts with both internal and external outlook. This promotes data reuse\nas opposed to data accumulation.\n\nWhy do FAIR principles matter for geospatial data and geospatial data\n\nproducts? FAIR is transcendent to geospatial data, it is actually transcendent\nto data, it is a simple yet coherent system of guiding principles for good design\n‚Äî and that good design can be applied to anything including geospatial data\nand geospatial systems.\n\n\nFigure 2:\nNDSI Strategic Goals\n\n\n-----\n\n**Grid index systems**\n\nIn traditional GIS solutions‚Äô performance of spatial operations are usually\nachieved by building tree structures ( [KD trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree) , [ball trees](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283471105_Ball-tree_Efficient_spatial_indexing_for_constrained_nearest-neighbor_search_in_metric_spaces) , [Quad trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree) , etc).\nThe issue with tree approaches is that they eventually break the scalability\nprinciple ‚Äî when the data is too big to be processed in order to build the tree\nand the computation required to build the tree is too long and defeats the\npurpose. This also negatively affects the accessibility of data; if we cannot\nconstruct the tree we cannot access the complete data and in effect we cannot\nreproduce the results. In this case, grid index systems provide a solution.\n\n\nGrid index systems are built from the start with the scalability aspects of the\ngeospatial data in mind. Rather than building the trees, they define a series of\ngrids that cover the area of interest. In the case of [H3](https://h3geo.org/) (pioneered by Uber),\nthe grid covers the area of the Earth; in the case of local grid index systems\n(e.g., [British National Grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnance_Survey_National_Grid) ) they may only cover the specific area of interest.\nThese grids are composed of cells that have unique identifiers. There is a\nmathematical relationship between location and the cell in the grid. This makes\nthe grid index systems very scalable and parallel in nature.\n\n\nFigure 4: Grid Index Systems (H3, British National Grid)\n\n\n-----\n\nAnother important aspect of grid index systems is that they are open source,\nallowing index values to be universally leveraged by data producers and\nconsumers alike. Data can be enriched with the grid index information at any\nstep of its journey through the data supply chain. This makes the grid index\nsystems an example of community driven data standards. Community driven\ndata standards by nature do not require enforcement, which fully adheres\nto the habit generation aspect of value pyramid and meaningfully addresses\ninteroperability and accessibility principles of FAIR.\n\n\nDatabricks has recently announced [native support for the H3 grid index system](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/09/14/announcing-built-h3-expressions-geospatial-processing-and-analytics.html)\nfollowing the same value proposition. Adopting common industry standards\ndriven by the community is the only way to properly drive habit generation and\ninteroperability. To strengthen this statement, organizations like [CARTO](https://carto.com/blog/hexagons-for-location-intelligence/) , [ESRI](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/bus-analyst/analytics/using-uber-h3-hexagons-arcgis-business-analyst-pro/)\nand [Google](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2017/12/announcing-s2-library-geometry-on-sphere.html) have been promoting the usage of grid index systems for scalable\nGIS system design. In addition, Databricks Labs project [Mosaic](https://databrickslabs.github.io/mosaic/) supports the\n[British National Grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnance_Survey_National_Grid) as the standard grid index system that is widely used in\nthe UK government. Grid index systems are key for the scalability of geospatial\ndata processing and for properly designing solutions for complex problems\n(e.g., figure 5 ‚Äî flight holding patterns using H3).\n\n**Geospatial data diversity**\n\nGeospatial data standards spend a solid amount of effort regarding data\nformat standardization, and format for that matter is one of the most\nimportant considerations when it comes to interoperability and reproducibility.\nFurthermore, if the reading of your data is complex ‚Äî how can we talk about\nsimplicity? Unfortunately geospatial data formats are typically complex, as\ndata can be produced in a number of formats including both open source\n\nand vendor-specific formats. Considering only vector data, we can expect\ndata to arrive in WKT, WKB, GeoJSON, web CSV, CSV, Shape File, GeoPackage,\nand many others. On the other hand, if we are considering raster data we can\nexpect data to arrive in any number of formats such as GeoTiff, netCDF, GRIB, or\nGeoDatabase; for a comprehensive list of formats please consult this [blog](https://gisgeography.com/gis-formats/) .\n\n\nFigure 5: Example of using H3 to express flight holding patterns\n\n\n-----\n\nGeospatial data domain is so diverse and has organically grown over the years\naround the use cases it was addressing. Unification of such a diverse ecosystem\nis a massive challenge. A recent effort by the Open Geospatial Consortium\n(OGC) to standardize to [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) and its geospatial schema specification\n[GeoParquet](https://geoparquet.org/) is a step in the right direction. Simplicity is one of the key aspects\nof designing a good scalable and robust product ‚Äî unification leads to simplicity\nand addresses one of the main sources of friction in the ecosystem ‚Äî the data\ningestion. Standardizing to GeoParquet brings a lot of value that addresses all of\nthe aspects of FAIR data and value pyramid.\n\nFigure 6: Geoparquet as a geospatial standard data format\n\n\nWhy introduce another format into an already complex ecosystem? GeoParquet\nisn‚Äôt a new format ‚Äî it is a schema specification for Apache Parquet format that\nis already widely adopted and used by the industry and the community. Parquet\nas the base format supports binary columns and allows for storage of arbitrary\ndata payload. At the same time the format supports structured data columns\nthat can store metadata together with the data payload. This makes it a choice\nthat promotes interoperability and reproducibility. Finally, [Delta Lake](https://delta.io/) format\nhas been built on top of parquet and brings [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) properties to the table. ACID\nproperties of a format are crucial for reproducibility and for trusted outputs. In\naddition, Delta is the format used by scalable data sharing solution [Delta Sharing](https://www.databricks.com/product/delta-sharing) .\n\nDelta Sharing enables enterprise scale data sharing between any public cloud\nusing Databricks (DIY options for private cloud are available using open source\nbuilding blocks). Delta Sharing completely abstracts the need for custom built\nRest APIs for exposing data to other third parties. Any data asset stored in Delta\n(using GeoParquet schema) automatically becomes a data product that can be\nexposed to external parties in a controlled and governed manner. Delta Sharing\nhas been built from the ground up with [security best practices in mind](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/08/01/security-best-practices-for-delta-sharing.html?utm_source=bambu&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=advocacy&blaid=3352307) .\n\n\n-----\n\nFigure 7: Delta Sharing simplifying data access in the ecosystem\n\n**Circular data economy**\n\n\nBorrowing the concepts from the sustainability domain, we can define a circular\ndata economy as a system in which data is collected, shared, and used in a way\nthat maximizes its value while minimizing waste and negative impacts, such as\nunnecessary compute time, untrustworthy insights, or biased actions based\ndata pollutants. Reusability is the key concept in this consideration ‚Äî how can\nwe minimize the \"reinvention of the wheel.\" There are countless data assets out\nin the wild that represent the same area, same concepts with just ever slight\nalterations to better match a specific use case. Is this due to the actual\n\n\noptimizations or due to the fact it was easier to create a new copy of the assets\nthan to reuse the existing ones? Or was it too hard to find the existing data\nassets, or maybe it was too complex to define data access patterns.\n\nData asset duplication has many negative aspects in both FAIR considerations\nand data value pyramid considerations ‚Äî having many disparate similar (but\ndifferent) data assets that represent the same area and same concepts can\ndeteriorate simplicity considerations of the data domain ‚Äî it becomes hard\nto identify the data asset we actually can trust. It can also have very negative\n\n\n-----\n\nimplications toward habit generation. Many niche communities will emerge\nthat will standardize to themselves ignoring the best practices of the wider\necosystem, or worse yet they will not standardize at all.\n\nIn a circular data economy, data is treated as a valuable resource that can be\nused to create new products and services, as well as improving existing ones.\nThis approach encourages the reuse and recycling of data, rather than treating it\nas a disposable commodity. Once again, we are using the sustainability analogy\nin a literal sense ‚Äî we argue that this is the correct way of approaching the\nproblem. Data pollutants are a real challenge for organizations both internally and\nexternally. An article by The Guardian states that less than 1% of collected data is\nactually analyzed. There is too much data duplication, the majority of data is hard\nto access and deriving actual value is too cumbersome. Circular data economy\npromotes best practices and reusability of existing data assets allowing for a more\nconsistent interpretation and insights across the wider data ecosystem.\n\n\nFigure 8: Databricks Marketplace\n\n\n-----\n\nInteroperability is a key component of FAIR data principles, and from\ninteroperability a question of circularity comes to mind. How can we design an\necosystem that maximizes data utilization and data reuse? Once again, FAIR\ntogether with the value pyramid holds answers. Findability of the data is key to\nthe data reuse and to solving for data pollution. With data assets that can be\ndiscovered easily we can avoid the recreation of same data assets in multiple\nplaces with just slight alteration. Instead we gain a coherent data ecosystem\nwith data that can be easily combined and reused. Databricks has recently\nannounced the [Databricks Marketplace](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/06/28/introducing-databricks-marketplace-an-open-marketplace-for-all-data-and-ai-assets.html) . The idea behind the marketplace is in\nline with the original definition of data product by DJ Patel. The marketplace\nwill support sharing of data sets, notebooks, dashboards, and machine learning\nmodels. The critical building block for such a marketplace is the concept of\nDelta Sharing ‚Äî the scalable, flexible and robust channel for sharing any data ‚Äî\ngeospatial data included.\n\n\nDesigning scalable data products that will live in the marketplace is crucial.\nIn order to maximize the value add of each data product one should strongly\nconsider FAIR principles and the product value pyramid. Without these guiding\nprinciples we will only increase the issues that are already present in the\ncurrent systems. Each data product should solve a unique problem and should\nsolve it in a simple, reproducible and robust way.\n\n**You can read more on how Databricks Lakehouse**\n**Platform can help you accelerate time to value from**\n**your data products in the eBook:** **[A New Approach](https://www.databricks.com/p/ebook/a-new-approach-to-data-sharing)**\n**[to Data Sharing](https://www.databricks.com/p/ebook/a-new-approach-to-data-sharing)** **.**\n\n**Start experimenting with these**\n**free Databricks** **notebooks** **.**\n\n\n-----\n\nSECTION 2.7 \u0007\n\n**Data Lineage With Unity Catalog**\n\nby **P A U L R O O M E , TA O F E N G A N D S A C H I N T H A K U R**\n\nJune 8, 2022\n\n\nThis blog will discuss the importance of data lineage, some of the common\nuse cases, our vision for better data transparency and data understanding with\ndata lineage.\n\n**What is data lineage and why is it important?**\n\nData lineage describes the transformations and refinements of data from source\nto insight. Lineage includes capturing all the relevant metadata and events\nassociated with the data in its lifecycle, including the source of the data set,\nwhat other data sets were used to create it, who created it and when, what\ntransformations were performed, what other data sets leverage it, and many other\nevents and attributes. With a data lineage solution, data teams get an end-to-end\nview of how data is transformed and how it flows across their data estate.\n\nAs more and more organizations embrace a data-driven culture and set up\nprocesses and tools to democratize and scale data and AI, data lineage is\nbecoming an essential pillar of a pragmatic data management and governance\nstrategy.\n\nTo understand the importance of data lineage, we have highlighted some of the\ncommon use cases we have heard from our customers below.\n\n\n**Impact analysis**\nData goes through multiple updates or revisions over its lifecycle, and\nunderstanding the potential impact of any data changes on downstream\nconsumers becomes important from a risk management standpoint. With data\nlineage, data teams can see all the downstream consumers ‚Äî applications,\ndashboards, machine learning models or data sets, etc. ‚Äî impacted by data\nchanges, understand the severity of the impact, and notify the relevant\nstakeholders. Lineage also helps IT teams proactively communicate data\nmigrations to the appropriate teams, ensuring business continuity.\n\n**Data understanding and transparency**\nOrganizations deal with an influx of data from multiple sources, and building\na better understanding of the context around data is paramount to ensure\nthe trustworthiness of the data. Data lineage is a powerful tool that enables\ndata leaders to drive better transparency and understanding of data in their\norganizations. Data lineage also empowers data consumers such as data scientists,\ndata engineers and data analysts to be context-aware as they perform analyses,\nresulting in better quality outcomes. Finally, data stewards can see which data sets\nare no longer accessed or have become obsolete to retire unnecessary data and\nensure data quality for end business users .\n\n\n-----\n\n**Debugging and diagnostics**\nYou can have all the checks and balances in place, but something will eventually\nbreak. Data lineage helps data teams perform a root cause analysis of any errors\nin their data pipelines, applications, dashboards, machine learning models, etc.,\nby tracing the error to its source. This significantly reduces the debugging time,\nsaving days, or in many cases, months of manual effort.\n\n**Compliance and audit readiness**\nMany compliance regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation\n(GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Health Insurance Portability and\nAccountability Act (HIPPA), Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) 239,\nand Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), require organizations to have clear understanding\nand visibility of data flow. As a result, data traceability becomes a key requirement\nin order for their data architecture to meet legal regulations. Data lineage helps\norganizations be compliant and audit-ready, thereby alleviating the operational\noverhead of manually creating the trails of data flows for audit reporting purposes.\n\n\n**Effortless transparency and proactive control with**\n**data lineage**\n\nThe [lakehouse](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2020/01/30/what-is-a-data-lakehouse.html) provides a pragmatic data management architecture that\nsubstantially simplifies enterprise data infrastructure and accelerates innovation\nby unifying your data warehousing and AI use cases on a single platform.\nWe believe data lineage is a key enabler of better data transparency and data\nunderstanding in your lakehouse, surfacing the relationships between data,\njobs, and consumers, and helping organizations move toward proactive data\nmanagement practices. For example:\n\n**‚Ä¢** As the owner of a dashboard, do you want to be notified next time that a\ntable your dashboard depends upon wasn‚Äôt loaded correctly?\n\n**‚Ä¢** As a machine learning practitioner developing a model, do you want to be\nalerted that a critical feature in your model will be deprecated soon?\n\n**‚Ä¢** As a governance admin, do you want to automatically control access to\ndata based on its provenance?\n\nAll of these capabilities rely upon the automatic collection of data lineage across\nall use cases and personas ‚Äî which is why the lakehouse and data lineage are a\npowerful combination.\n\n\n-----\n\nData lineage for tables\n\nData lineage for table columns\n\n\nData Lineage for notebooks, workflows, dashboards\n\n**Built-in security:** Lineage graphs in Unity Catalog are privilege-aware and share\nthe same permission model as Unity Catalog. If users do not have access to\na table, they will not be able to explore the lineage associated with the table,\nadding an additional layer of security for privacy considerations.\n\n**Easily exportable via REST API:** Lineage can be visualized in the Data Explorer\nin near real-time, and retrieved via REST API to support integrations with our\ncatalog partners.\n\n**Getting started with data lineage in Unity Catalog**\n\nData lineage is available with Databricks Premium and Enterprise tiers for\nno additional cost. If you already are a Databricks customer, follow the data\nlineage guides ( [AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/data-lineage.html) | [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/data-governance/unity-catalog/data-lineage) ) to get started.

One of the key success factors for using the\ndata lakehouse for analytics and machine learning is the ability to quickly and\neasily ingest data of various types, including data from on-premises storage\nplatforms (data warehouses, mainframes), real-time streaming data, and bulk\ndata assets.\n\nAs data ingestion into the lakehouse is an ongoing process that feeds the\nproverbial ETL pipeline, you will need multiple options to ingest various formats,\ntypes and latency of data. For data stored in cloud object stores such as AWS\nS3, Google Cloud Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage, Databricks offers\nAuto Loader, a natively integrated feature, that allows data engineers to ingest\nmillions of files from the cloud storage continuously. In other streaming cases\n\n(e.g., IoT sensor or clickstream data), Databricks provides native connectors\nfor Apache Spark Structured Streaming to quickly ingest data from popular\nmessage queues, such as [Apache Kafka](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/structured-streaming/kafka.html?_ga=2.117268486.126296912.1643033657-734003504.1641217794) , Azure Event Hubs or AWS Kinesis at low\nlatencies. Furthermore, many customers can leverage popular ingestion tools\n\n\nthat integrate with Databricks, such as Fivetran ‚Äî to easily ingest data from\nenterprise applications, databases, mainframes and more into the lakehouse.\nFinally, analysts can use the simple ‚ÄúCOPY INTO‚Äù command to pull new data into\nthe lakehouse automatically, without the need to keep track of which files have\nalready been processed.\n\nThis blog focuses on COPY INTO, a simple yet powerful SQL command that allows\nyou to perform batch file ingestion into Delta Lake from cloud object stores.\nIt‚Äôs idempotent, which guarantees to ingest files with exactly-once semantics\nwhen executed multiple times, supporting incremental appends and simple\ntransformations. It can be run once, in an ad hoc manner, and can be scheduled\nthrough Databricks Workflows. In recent Databricks [Runtime releases](https://docs.databricks.com/release-notes/runtime/releases.html) , COPY\nINTO introduced new functionalities for data preview, validation, enhanced error\nhandling, and a new way to copy into a schemaless Delta Lake table so that users\n\ncan get started quickly, completing the end-to-end user journey to ingest from\ncloud object stores. Let‚Äôs take a look at the popular COPY INTO use cases.\n\n\n-----\n\n**1. Ingesting data for the first time**\n\n\nThe default for data validation is to parse all the data in the source directory to\nensure that there aren‚Äôt any issues, but the rows returned for preview are limited.\nOptionally, you can provide the number of rows to preview after VALIDATE.\n\nThe COPY_OPTION ‚ÄúmergeSchema‚Äù specifies that it is okay to evolve the schema\nof your target Delta table. Schema evolution only allows the addition of new\ncolumns, and does not support data type changes for existing columns. In other\nuse cases, you can omit this option if you intend to manage your table schema\nmore strictly as your data pipeline may have strict schema requirements and\nmay not want to evolve the schema at all times. However, our target Delta table\nin the example above is an empty, columnless table at the moment; therefore,\nwe have to specify the COPY_OPTION ‚ÄúmergeSchema‚Äù here.\n\nFigure 1: COPY INTO VALIDATE mode output\n\n\nCOPY INTO requires a table to exist as it ingests the data into a target Delta\ntable. However, you have no idea what your data looks like. You first create an\nempty Delta table.\n```\n CREATE TABLE my_example_data;\n\n```\nBefore you write out your data, you may want to preview it and ensure the\ndata looks correct. The COPY INTO Validate mode is a new feature in\nDatabricks Runtime [10.3](https://docs.databricks.com/release-notes/runtime/10.3.html) and above that allows you to preview and validate\nsource data before ingesting many files from the cloud object stores.\nThese validations include:\n\n**‚Ä¢** if the data can be parsed\n\n**‚Ä¢** the schema matches that of the target table or if the schema\nneeds to be evolved\n\n**‚Ä¢** all nullability and check constraints on the table are met\n\nCOPY INTO my_example_data\nFROM 's3://my-bucket/exampleData'\nFILEFORMAT `=` CSV\nVALIDATE\nCOPY_OPTIONS ( 'mergeSchema' `=` 'true' )\n\n\n-----\n\n**2. Configuring COPY INTO**\n\n\nFigure 2 shows the validate output that the header is properly parsed.\n\nFigure 2: COPY INTO VALIDATE mode output with enabled header and inferSchema\n\n**3. Appending data to a Delta table**\n\nNow that the preview looks good, we can remove the VALIDATE keyword and\nexecute the COPY INTO command.\n\nCOPY INTO my_example_data\nFROM 's3://my-bucket/exampleData'\nFILEFORMAT `=` CSV\nFORMAT_OPTIONS ( 'header' `=` 'true' , 'inferSchema' `=` 'true' , 'mergeSchema' `=`\n'true' )\nCOPY_OPTIONS ( 'mergeSchema' `=` 'true' )\n\n\nWhen looking over the results of VALIDATE (see Figure 1), you may notice that\nyour data doesn‚Äôt look like what you want. Aren‚Äôt you glad you previewed your\ndata set first? The first thing you notice is the column names are not what is\nspecified in the CSV header. What‚Äôs worse, the header is shown as a row in your\ndata. You can configure the CSV parser by specifying FORMAT_OPTIONS.\nLet‚Äôs add those next.\n\nCOPY INTO my_example_data\nFROM 's3://my-bucket/exampleData'\nFILEFORMAT `=` CSV\nVALIDATE\nFORMAT_OPTIONS ( 'header' `=` 'true' , 'inferSchema' `=` 'true' , 'mergeSchema' `=`\n'true' )\nCOPY_OPTIONS ( 'mergeSchema' `=` 'true' )\n\nWhen using the FORMAT OPTION, you can tell COPY INTO to infer the data types\nof the CSV file by specifying the inferSchema option; otherwise, all default\ndata types are STRINGs. On the other hand, binary file formats like AVRO and\nPARQUET do not need this option since they define their own schema. Another\n\noption, ‚ÄúmergeSchema‚Äù states that the schema should be inferred over a\ncomprehensive sample of CSV files rather than just one. The comprehensive list\nof format-specific options can be found in the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sql/language-manual/delta-copy-into#format-options) .\n\n\n-----\n\nCOPY INTO keeps track of the state of files that\nhave been ingested. Unlike commands like INSERT\nINTO, users get idempotency with COPY INTO,\nwhich means users won‚Äôt get duplicate data in\nthe target table when running COPY INTO multiple\ntimes from the same source data.\n\nCOPY INTO can be run once, in an ad hoc manner,\nand can be scheduled with Databricks Workflows.\nWhile COPY INTO does not support low latencies\nfor ingesting natively, you can trigger COPY INTO\nthrough orchestrators like Apache Airflow.\n\n\nFigure 3: Databricks workflow UI to schedule a task\n\n\n-----\n\n**4. Secure data access with COPY INTO**\n\nCOPY INTO supports secure access in several ways. In this section, we want to\nhighlight two new options you can use in both [Databricks SQL](https://dbricks.co/dbsql) and notebooks\nfrom recent releases:\n\n**Unity Catalog**\nWith the general availability of Databrick Unity Catalog, you can use COPY INTO\nto ingest data to Unity Catalog managed or external tables from any source and\nfile format supported by COPY INTO. Unity Catalog also adds new options for\nconfiguring secure access to raw data, allowing you to use Unity Catalog external\nlocations or storage credentials to access data in cloud object storage. Learn\nmore about how to use [COPY INTO with Unity Catalog](https://docs.databricks.com/ingestion/copy-into/unity-catalog.html#use-copy-into-to-load-data-with-unity-catalog) .\n\n**Temporary Credentials**\nWhat if you have not configured Unity Catalog or instance profile? How about\ndata from a trusted third party bucket? Here is a convenient COPY INTO feature\nthat allows you to [ingest data with inline temporary credentials](https://docs.databricks.com/ingestion/copy-into/temporary-credentials.html) to handle the ad\nhoc bulk ingestion use case.\n\nCOPY INTO my_example_data\nFROM 's3://my-bucket/exampleDataPath' WITH (\nCREDENTIAL (AWS_ACCESS_KEY `=` '...' , AWS_SECRET_KEY `=` '...' , AWS_SESSION_\nTOKEN `=` '...' )\n)\nFILEFORMAT `=` CSV\n\n\n**5. Filtering files for ingestion**\n\nWhat about ingesting a subset of files where the filenames match a pattern? You\ncan apply glob patterns ‚Äî a glob pattern that identifies the files to load from the\nsource directory. For example, let‚Äôs filter and ingest files which contain the word\n`raw_data` in the filename below.\n\nCOPY INTO my_example_data\nFROM 's3://my-bucket/exampleDataPath'\nFILEFORMAT `=` CSV\nPATTERN `=` '*raw_data*.csv'\nFORMAT_OPTIONS ( 'header' `=` 'true' )\n\n**6. Ingest files in a time period**\n\nIn data engineering, it is frequently necessary to ingest files that have been\nmodified before or after a specific timestamp. Data between two timestamps\nmay also be of interest. The ‚ÄòmodifiedAfter‚Äô and ‚ÄòmodifiedBefore‚Äô format options\noffered by COPY INTO allow users to ingest data from a chosen time window into\na Delta table.\n\nCOPY INTO my_example_data\nFROM 's3://my-bucket/exampleDataPath'\nFILEFORMAT `=` CSV\nPATTERN `=` '*raw_data_*.csv'\nFORMAT_OPTIONS( '2022-0912T10:53:11.000+0000' 'header' ) `=` 'true' , 'modifiedAfter' `=`\n\n\n-----\n\n**7. Correcting data with the force option**\n\nBecause COPY INTO is by default idempotent, running the same query against\nthe same source files more than once has no effect on the destination table\nafter the initial execution. You must propagate changes to the target table\nbecause, in real-world circumstances, source data files in cloud object storage\nmay be altered for correction at a later time. In such a case, it is possible to first\nerase the data from the target table before ingesting the more recent data files\nfrom the source. For this operation you only need to set the copy option ‚Äòforce‚Äô\nto ‚Äòtrue‚Äô.\n\nCOPY INTO my_example_data\nFROM 's3://my-bucket/exampleDataPath'\nFILEFORMAT `=` CSV\nPATTERN `=` '*raw_data_2022*.csv'\nFORMAT_OPTIONS( 'header' `=` 'true' )\nCOPY_OPTIONS ( 'force' `=` 'true' )\n\n\n**8. Applying simple transformations**\n\nWhat if you want to rename columns? Or the source data has changed and a\nprevious column has been renamed to something else? You don‚Äôt want to ingest\nthat data as two separate columns, but as a single column. We can leverage the\nSELECT statement in COPY INTO perform simple transformations.\n\nCOPY INTO demo.my_example_data\nFROM ( SELECT concat(first_name, \" \", last_name) as full_name,\n`*` EXCEPT (first_name, last_name)\nFROM 's3://my-bucket/exampleDataPath'\n)\nFILEFORMAT `=` CSV\nPATTERN `=` '*.csv'\nFORMAT_OPTIONS( 'header' `=` 'true' )\nCOPY_OPTIONS ( 'force' `=` 'true' )\n\n**9. Error handling and observability with COPY INTO**\n\n**Error handling:**\nHow about ingesting data with file corruption issues? Common examples of file\ncorruption are:\n\n**‚Ä¢** Files with an incorrect file format\n\n**‚Ä¢** Failure to decompress\n\n**‚Ä¢** Unreadable files (e.g., invalid Parquet)\n\n\n-----\n\nCOPY INTO‚Äôs format option ignoreCorruptFiles helps skip those files while\nprocessing. The result of the COPY INTO command returns the number of files\nskipped in the num_skipped_corrupt_files column. In addition, these corrupt\nfiles aren‚Äôt tracked by the ingestion state in COPY INTO, therefore they can be\nreloaded in a subsequent execution once the corruption is fixed. This option is\navailable in Databricks [Runtime 11.0+](https://docs.databricks.com/release-notes/runtime/11.0.html) .\n\nYou can see which files have been detected as corrupt by running COPY INTO in\nVALIDATE mode.\n\nCOPY INTO my_example_data\nFROM 's3://my-bucket/exampleDataPath'\nFILEFORMAT `=` CSV\nVALIDATE ALL\nFORMAT_OPTIONS( 'ignoreCorruptFiles' `=` 'true' )\n\n**Observability:**\nIn Databricks Runtime 10.5, [file metadata column](https://docs.databricks.com/ingestion/file-metadata-column.html) was introduced to provide\ninput file metadata information, which allows users to monitor and get key\nproperties of the ingested files like path, name, size and modification time, by\nquerying a hidden STRUCT column called _metadata. To include this information\nin the destination, you must explicitly reference the _metadata column in your\nquery in COPY INTO.\n\nCOPY INTO my_example_data\nFROM (\nSELECT `*` , _metadata source_metadata FROM 's3://my-bucket/\nexampleDataPath'\n)\nFILEFORMAT `=` CSV\n\n\n**How does it compare to Auto Loader?**\n\nCOPY INTO is a simple and powerful command to use when your source\ndirectory contains a small number of files (i.e., thousands of files or less), and if\nyou prefer SQL. In addition, COPY INTO can be used over JDBC to push data into\nDelta Lake at your convenience, a common pattern by many ingestion partners.\nTo ingest a larger number of files both in streaming and batch we recommend\nusing [Auto Loader](https://docs.databricks.com/ingestion/auto-loader/index.html) . In addition, for a modern data pipeline based on [medallion](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture)\n[architecture](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture) , we recommend using Auto Loader in [Delta Live Tables pipelines](https://docs.databricks.com/ingestion/auto-loader/dlt.html) ,\nleveraging advanced capabilities of automatic error handling, quality control,\ndata lineage and setting [expectations](https://docs.databricks.com/workflows/delta-live-tables/delta-live-tables-expectations.html) in a declarative approach.\n\n**How to get started?**\n\nTo get started, you can go to **[Databricks SQL](https://dbricks.co/dbsql)** query editor, update and run the\nexample SQL commands to ingest from your cloud object stores. Check out\nthe options in No. 4 to establish secure access to your data for querying it in\nDatabricks SQL. To get familiar with COPY INTO in Databricks SQL, you can also\nfollow this [quickstart tutorial.](https://docs.databricks.com/ingestion/copy-into/tutorial-dbsql.html)\n\nAs an alternative, you can use this [notebook](https://www.databricks.com/wp-content/uploads/notebooks/db-385-demo_copy_into.html) in Data Science & Engineering and\nMachine Learning workspaces to learn most of the COPY INTO features in this\nblog, where source data and target Delta tables are generated in DBFS.\n\nMore tutorials for COPY INTO can be found [here](https://docs.databricks.com/ingestion/copy-into/index.html) .\n\n\n-----\n\nSECTION 2.9 \u0007\n\n**Simplifying Change Data Capture With Databricks Delta Live Tables**\n\nby **M O J G A N M A Z O U C H I**\n\nApril 25, 2022\n\n\nThis guide will demonstrate how you can leverage change data capture in Delta\nLive Tables pipelines to identify new records and capture changes made to the\ndata set in your data lake. Delta Live Tables pipelines enable you to develop\nscalable, reliable and low latency data pipelines, while performing change data\ncapturee in your data lake with minimum required computation resources and\nseamless out-of-order data handling.\n\n**Note:** We recommend following [Getting Started with Delta Live Tables](https://www.databricks.com/discover/pages/getting-started-with-delta-live-tables)\nwhich explains creating scalable and reliable pipelines using Delta Live Tables\n(DLT) and its declarative ETL definitions.\n\n**Background on change data capture**\n\nChange data capture ( [CDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture) ) is a process that identifies and captures incremental\nchanges (data deletes, inserts and updates) in databases, like tracking customer,\norder or product status for near-real-time data applications. CDC provides realtime data evolution by processing data in a continuous incremental fashion as\nnew events occur.\n\n\nSince [over 80% of organizations plan on implementing multicloud strategies](https://solutionsreview.com/data-integration/whats-changed-2020-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-data-integration-tools/)\n[by 2025](https://solutionsreview.com/data-integration/whats-changed-2020-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-data-integration-tools/) , choosing the right approach for your business that allows seamless\nreal-time centralization of all data changes in your ETL pipeline across multiple\nenvironments is critical.\n\nBy capturing CDC events, Databricks users can re-materialize the source table\nas Delta Table in Lakehouse and run their analysis on top of it, while being able\nto combine data with external systems. The MERGE INTO command in Delta Lake\non Databricks enables customers to efficiently upsert and delete records in\ntheir data lakes ‚Äî you can check out our previous deep dive on the topic [here](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2018/10/29/simplifying-change-data-capture-with-databricks-delta.html) .\nThis is a common use case that we observe many of Databricks customers are\nleveraging Delta Lakes to perform, and keeping their data lakes up to date with\nreal-time business data.\n\nWhile Delta Lake provides a complete solution for real-time CDC synchronization\nin a data lake, we are now excited to announce the change data capture feature\nin Delta Live Tables that makes your architecture even simpler, more efficient and\nscalable. DLT allows users to ingest CDC data seamlessly using SQL and Python.\n\nEarlier CDC solutions with Delta tables were using MERGE INTO operation, which\nrequires manually ordering the data to avoid failure when multiple rows of the\nsource data set match while attempting to update the same rows of the target\n\n\n-----\n\nDelta table. To handle the out-of-order data, there was an extra step required to\npreprocess the source table using a foreachBatch implementation to eliminate\nthe possibility of multiple matches, retaining only the latest change for each\nkey (see the [change data capture example](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/04/25/simplifying-change-data-capture-with-databricks-delta-live-tables.html#) ). The new APPLY CHANGES INTO\noperation in DLT pipelines automatically and seamlessly handles out-of-order\ndata without any need for data engineering manual intervention.\n\n**CDC with Databricks Delta Live Tables**\n\nIn this blog, we will demonstrate how to use the APPLY CHANGES INTO command\nin Delta Live Tables pipelines for a common CDC use case where the CDC data\nis coming from an external system. A variety of CDC tools are available such\nas Debezium, Fivetran, Qlik Replicate, Talend, and StreamSets. While specific\nimplementations differ, these tools generally capture and record the history\nof data changes in logs; downstream applications consume these CDC logs. In\nour example, data is landed in cloud object storage from a CDC tool such as\nDebezium, Fivetran, etc.\n\nWe have data from various CDC tools landing in a cloud object storage or a\nmessage queue like Apache Kafka. Typically we see CDC used in an ingestion\nto what we refer as the medallion architecture. A medallion architecture is a\ndata design pattern used to logically organize data in a Lakehouse, with the\ngoal of incrementally and progressively improving the structure and quality of\ndata as it flows through each layer of the architecture. Delta Live Tables allows\nyou to seamlessly apply changes from CDC feeds to tables in your Lakehouse;\ncombining this functionality with the medallion architecture allows for\n\n\nincremental changes to easily flow through analytical workloads at scale. Using\nCDC together with the medallion architecture provides multiple benefits to users\nsince only changed or added data needs to be processed. Thus, it enables users\nto cost-effectively keep Gold tables up-to-date with the latest business data.\n\n**NOTE:** The example here applies to both SQL and Python versions of CDC\nand also on a specific way to use the operations; to evaluate variations,\nplease see the official documentation [here](https://docs.databricks.com/data-engineering/delta-live-tables/delta-live-tables-cdc.html#python) .\n\n**Prerequisites**\n\nTo get the most out of this guide, you should have a basic familiarity with:\n\n**‚Ä¢** SQL or Python\n\n**‚Ä¢** Delta Live Tables\n\n**‚Ä¢** Developing ETL pipelines and/or working with Big Data systems\n\n**‚Ä¢** Databricks interactive notebooks and clusters\n\n**‚Ä¢** You must have access to a Databricks Workspace with permissions\nto create new clusters, run jobs, and save data to a location on\nexternal cloud object storage or [DBFS](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/data/databricks-file-system.html)\n\n**‚Ä¢** For the pipeline we are creating in this blog, ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù product\nedition which supports enforcement of data quality constraints,\nneeds to be selected\n\n\n-----\n\n**The data set**\n\nHere we are consuming realistic looking CDC data from an external database. In\nthis pipeline, we will use the [Faker](https://github.com/joke2k/faker) library to generate the data set that a CDC\ntool like Debezium can produce and bring into cloud storage for the initial ingest\nin Databricks. Using [Auto Loader](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/structured-streaming/auto-loader.html) we incrementally load the messages from cloud\nobject storage, and store them in the Bronze table as it stores the raw messages.\nThe Bronze tables are intended for data ingestion which enable quick access to a\nsingle source of truth. Next we perform APPLY CHANGES INTO from the cleaned\nBronze layer table to propagate the updates downstream to the Silver table. As\ndata flows to Silver tables, generally it becomes more refined and optimized\n(‚Äújust-enough‚Äù) to provide an enterprise a view of all its key business entities.\nSee the diagram below.\n\n\nThis blog focuses on a simple example that requires a JSON message with\nfour fields of customer‚Äôs name, email, address and id along with the two fields:\noperation (which stores operation code (DELETE, APPEND, UPDATE, CREATE) and\noperation_date (which stores the date and timestamp for the record came for\neach operation action) to describe the changed data.\n\nTo generate a sample data set with the above fields, we are using a Python\npackage that generates fake data, Faker. You can find the notebook related to this\ndata generation section [here](https://www.databricks.com/wp-content/uploads/notebooks/DB-129/1-cdc-data-generator.html) . In this notebook we provide the name and storage\nlocation to write the generated data there. We are using the DBFS functionality of\nDatabricks; see the [DBFS documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/user-guide/dbfs-databricks-file-system.html) to learn more about how it works. Then,\nwe use a PySpark user-defined function to generate the synthetic data set for\neach field, and write the data back to the defined storage location, which we will\nrefer to in other notebooks for accessing the synthetic data set.\n\n**Ingesting the raw data set using Auto Loader**\n\nAccording to the medallion architecture paradigm, the Bronze layer holds the\nmost raw data quality. At this stage we can incrementally read new data using\nAuto Loader from a location in cloud storage. Here we are adding the path to our\ngenerated data set to the configuration section under pipeline settings, which\nallows us to load the source path as a variable. So now our configuration under\npipeline settings looks like below:\n\n\"configuration\" : {\n\"source\" : \"/tmp/demo/cdc_raw\"\n\n\n-----\n\nThen we load this configuration property in our notebooks.\n\nLet‚Äôs take a look at the Bronze table we will ingest, a. In SQL, and b. Using Python\n\n**A . S Q L**\n\nSET spark.source;\nCREATE STREAMING LIVE TABLE customer_bronze\n(\naddress string ,\nemail string ,\nid string ,\nfirstname string ,\nlastname string ,\noperation string ,\noperation_date string ,\n_rescued_data string\n)\nTBLPROPERTIES ( \"quality\" = \"bronze\" )\nCOMMENT \"New customer data incrementally ingested from cloud object\nstorage landing zone\"\nAS\nSELECT *\nFROM cloud_files( \"${source}/customers\" , \"json\" , map( \"cloudFiles.\ninferColumnTypes\" , \"true\" ));\n\n\n**B . P Y T H O N**\n\nimport dlt\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import - \nfrom pyspark.sql.types import - \n\nsource = spark.conf.get( \"source\" )\n\n**@dlt.table(name=** **\"customer_bronze\"** **,**\n**comment =** **\"New customer data incrementally ingested from**\n**cloud object storage landing zone\"** **,**\n**table_properties={**\n**\"quality\"** **:** **\"bronze\"**\n**}**\n**)**\n```\n def customer_bronze ():\n\n```\nreturn (\nspark.readStream. format ( \"cloudFiles\" ) \\\n.option( \"cloudFiles.format\" , \"json\" ) \\\n.option( \"cloudFiles.inferColumnTypes\" , \"true\" ) \\\n.load( f\" {source} /customers\" )\n)\n\nThe above statements use the Auto Loader to create a streaming live table\ncalled customer_bronze from json files. When using Auto Loader in Delta Live\n\nTables, you do not need to provide any location for schema or checkpoint, as\nthose locations will be managed automatically by your DLT pipeline.\n\nAuto Loader provides a Structured Streaming source called cloud_files in\nSQL and cloudFiles in Python, which takes a cloud storage path and format as\nparameters.\n\nTo reduce compute costs, we recommend running the DLT pipeline in\nTriggered mode as a micro-batch assuming you do not have very low latency\nrequirements.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Expectations and high-quality data**\n\nIn the next step to create a high-quality, diverse, and accessible data set,\nwe impose quality check expectation criteria using Constraints. Currently,\na constraint can be either retain, drop, or fail. For more detail see [here](https://docs.databricks.com/data-engineering/delta-live-tables/delta-live-tables-expectations.html) . All\nconstraints are logged to enable streamlined quality monitoring.\n\n**A . S Q L**\n\nCREATE TEMPORARY STREAMING LIVE TABLE customer_bronze_clean_v(\nCONSTRAINT valid_id EXPECT (id IS NOT NULL ) ON VIOLATION DROP ROW ,\nCONSTRAINT valid_address EXPECT (address IS NOT NULL ),\nCONSTRAINT valid_operation EXPECT (operation IS NOT NULL ) ON VIOLATION\nDROP ROW\n)\nTBLPROPERTIES (\"quality\" `=` \"silver\")\nCOMMENT \"Cleansed bronze customer view (i.e. what will become Silver)\"\nAS SELECT `*`\nFROM STREAM(LIVE.customer_bronze);\n\n**B . P Y T H O N**\n```\n @dlt.view(name= \"customer_bronze_clean_v\" ,\n  comment= \"Cleansed bronze customer view (i.e. what will become Silver)\" )\n\n```\n\n**Using APPLY CHANGES INTO statement to propagate changes to**\n\n**downstream target table**\n\nPrior to executing the Apply Changes Into query, we must ensure that a target\nstreaming table which we want to hold the most up-to-date data exists. If it\ndoes not exist we need to create one. Below cells are examples of creating a\ntarget streaming table. Note that at the time of publishing this blog, the target\nstreaming table creation statement is required along with the Apply Changes\nInto query, and both need to be present in the pipeline ‚Äî otherwise your table\ncreation query will fail.\n\n**A . S Q L**\n\nCREATE STREAMING LIVE TABLE customer_silver\nTBLPROPERTIES (\"quality\" `=` \"silver\")\nCOMMENT \"Clean, merged customers\";\n\n**B . P Y T H O N**\n\ndlt.create_target_table(name= \"customer_silver\" ,\ncomment= \"Clean, merged customers\" ,\ntable_properties={\n\"quality\" : \"silver\"\n\n```\n@dlt.expect_or_drop( \"valid_id\" , \"id IS NOT NULL\" )\n@dlt.expect( \"valid_address\" , \"address IS NOT NULL\" )\n@dlt.expect_or_drop( \"valid_operation\" , \"operation IS NOT NULL\" )\ndef customer_bronze_clean_v ():\n return dlt.read_stream( \"customer_bronze\" ) \\\n\n```\n`.select(` `\"address\"` `,` `\"email\"` `,` `\"id\"` `,` \"firstname\" `,` `\"lastname\"` `,`\n```\n\"operation\" , \"operation_date\" , \"_rescued_data\" )\n\n```\n\n-----\n\nNow that we have a target streaming table, we can propagate changes to the\ndownstream target table using the Apply Changes Into query. While CDC feed\ncomes with INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE events, DLT default behavior is to apply\nINSERT and UPDATE events from any record in the source data set matching\non primary keys, and sequenced by a field which identifies the order of events.\nMore specifically it updates any row in the existing target table that matches\nthe primary key(s) or inserts a new row when a matching record does not exist\nin the target streaming table. We can use APPLY AS DELETE WHEN in SQL, or its\nequivalent apply_as_deletes argument in Python to handle DELETE events.\n\nIn this example we used \"id\" as my primary key, which uniquely identifies the\ncustomers and allows CDC events to apply to those identified customer records\nin the target streaming table. Since \"operation_date\" keeps the logical order of\nCDC events in the source data set, we use \"SEQUENCE BY operation_date\" in\nSQL, or its equivalent \"sequence_by = col(\"operation_date\")\" in Python to handle\nchange events that arrive out of order. Keep in mind that the field value we use\nwith SEQUENCE BY (or sequence_by) should be unique among all updates to\nthe same key. In most cases, the sequence by column will be a column with\ntimestamp information.\n\nFinally we used \"COLUMNS * EXCEPT (operation, operation_date, _rescued_\ndata)\" in SQL, or its equivalent \"except_column_list\"= [\"operation\", \"operation_\ndate\", \"_rescued_data\"] in Python to exclude three columns of \"operation\",\n\"operation_date\", \"_rescued_data\" from the target streaming table. By default all\nthe columns are included in the target streaming table, when we do not specify\nthe \"COLUMNS\" clause.\n\n\n**A . S Q L**\n\nAPPLY CHANGES INTO LIVE.customer_silver\nFROM stream(LIVE.customer_bronze_clean_v)\nKEYS (id)\nAPPLY AS DELETE WHEN operation `=` \"DELETE\"\nSEQUENCE BY operation_date\nCOLUMNS `*` EXCEPT (operation, operation_date,\n_rescued_data);\n\n**B . P Y T H O N**\n```\n dlt.apply_changes(\n  target = \"customer_silver\",\n  source = \"customer_bronze_clean_v\",\n  keys = [\"id\"],\n  sequence_by = col(\"operation_date\"),\n  apply_as_deletes = expr(\"operation = 'DELETE'\"),\n  except_column_list = [\"operation\", \"operation_date\", \"_rescued_data\"])\n\n```\nTo check out the full list of available clauses see [here](https://docs.databricks.com/data-engineering/delta-live-tables/delta-live-tables-cdc.html#requirements) .\n\nPlease note that, at the time of publishing this blog, a table that reads from the\ntarget of an APPLY CHANGES INTO query or apply_changes function must be a\nlive table, and cannot be a streaming live table.\n\nA [SQL](https://www.databricks.com/wp-content/uploads/notebooks/DB-129/2-retail-dlt-cdc-sql.html) and [Python](https://www.databricks.com/wp-content/uploads/notebooks/DB-129/2-Retail_DLT_CDC_Python.html) notebook is available for reference for this section. Now that\nwe have all the cells ready, let‚Äôs create a pipeline to ingest data from cloud object\nstorage. Open Jobs in a new tab or window in your workspace, and select ‚ÄúDelta\nLive Tables.‚Äù\n\n\n-----\n\nThe pipeline associated with this blog has the following DLT pipeline settings:\n\n{\n\"clusters\" : [\n{\n\"label\" : \"default\" ,\n\"num_workers\" : 1\n}\n],\n\"development\" : true ,\n\"continuous\" : false ,\n\"edition\" : \"advanced\" ,\n\"photon\" : false ,\n\"libraries\" : [\n{\n\"notebook\" : {\n\"path\" : \"/Repos/mojgan.mazouchi@databricks.com/Delta-Live-Tables/\nnotebooks/1-CDC_DataGenerator\"\n}\n},\n{\n\"notebook\" : {\n\"path\" : \"/Repos/mojgan.mazouchi@databricks.com/Delta-Live-Tables/\nnotebooks/2-Retail_DLT_CDC_sql\"\n}\n}\n],\n\"name\" : \"CDC_blog\" ,\n\"storage\" : \"dbfs:/home/mydir/myDB/dlt_storage\" ,\n\"configuration\" : {\n\"source\" : \"/tmp/demo/cdc_raw\" ,\n\"pipelines.applyChangesPreviewEnabled\" : \"true\"\n},\n\"target\" : \"my_database\"\n\n\n1. Select ‚ÄúCreate Pipeline‚Äù to create a new pipeline\n\n2. Specify a name such as ‚ÄúRetail CDC Pipeline‚Äù\n\n3. Specify the Notebook Paths that you already created earlier, one for the\ngenerated data set using Faker package, and another path for the ingestion\nof the generated data in DLT. The second notebook path can refer to the\nnotebook written in SQL, or Python depending on your language of choice.\n\n4. To access the data generated in the first notebook, add the data set path in\nconfiguration. Here we stored data in ‚Äú/tmp/demo/cdc_raw/customers‚Äù, so\nwe set ‚Äúsource‚Äù to ‚Äú/tmp/demo/cdc_raw/‚Äù to reference ‚Äúsource/customers‚Äù in\nour second notebook.\n\n5. Specify the Target (which is optional and referring to the target database),\nwhere you can query the resulting tables from your pipeline\n\n6. Specify the Storage Location in your object storage (which is optional), to\naccess your DLT produced data sets and metadata logs for your pipeline\n\n7. Set Pipeline Mode to Triggered. In Triggered mode, DLT pipeline will consume\nnew data in the source all at once, and once the processing is done it will\nterminate the compute resource automatically. You can toggle between\nTriggered and Continuous modes when editing your pipeline settings. Setting\n‚Äúcontinuous‚Äù: false in the JSON is equivalent to setting the pipeline to\nTriggered mode.\n\n8. For this workload you can disable the autoscaling under Autopilot Options,\nand use only one worker cluster. For production workloads, we recommend\nenabling autoscaling and setting the maximum numbers of workers needed\nfor cluster size.\n\n9. Select ‚ÄúStart‚Äù\n\n10. Your pipeline is created and running now!\n\n\n-----\n\nYou can check out our previous deep dive on the topic [here](https://www.databricks.com/discover/pages/getting-started-with-delta-live-tables#pipeline-observability) . Try this [notebook](https://www.databricks.com/wp-content/uploads/notebooks/DB-129/3-retail-dlt-cdc-monitoring.html)\nto see pipeline observability and data quality monitoring on the example DLT\npipeline associated with this blog.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn this blog, we showed how we made it seamless for users to efficiently\nimplement change data capture (CDC) into their lakehouse platform with Delta\nLive Tables (DLT).

Government\ncan share data for various reasons, such as to improve government operations‚Äô\nefficiency, provide better services to the public, or support research and policymaking. In addition, data exchange in the public sector can involve sharing with the\nprivate sector or receiving data from the private sector. The considerations span\nmultiple jurisdictions and over almost all industries. In this blog, we will address the\nneeds disclosed as part of national data strategies and how modern technologies,\nparticularly Delta Sharing, Unity Catalog, and clean rooms, can help you design,\nimplement and manage a future-proof and sustainable data ecosystem.\n\n**Data sharing and public sector**\n\n‚ÄúThe miracle is this: the more we share the more we have.‚Äù ‚Äî [Leonard Nimoy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Nimoy)\n\nProbably the quote about sharing that applies the most profoundly to the\ntopic of data sharing. To the extent that the purpose of sharing the data is to\ncreate new information, new insights, and new data. The importance of data\nsharing is even more amplified in the government context, where federation\n\n\nbetween departments allows for increased focus. Still, the very same federation\nintroduces challenges around data completeness, data quality, data access,\nsecurity and control, [FAIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data) -ness of data, etc. These challenges are far from trivial\nand require a strategic, multifaceted approach to be addressed appropriately.\nTechnology, people, process, legal frameworks, etc., require dedicated\nconsideration when designing a robust data sharing ecosystem.\n\n[The National Data Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-national-data-strategy/national-data-strategy) (NDS) by the UK government outlines five actionable\nmissions through which we can materialize the value of data for the citizen and\nsociety-wide benefits.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt comes as no surprise that each and every one of the missions is strongly\nrelated to the concept of data sharing, or more broadly, data access both within\nand outside of government departments:\n\n**1. Unlocking the value of the data across the economy** ‚Äî Mission 1 of the\nNDS aims to assert government and the regulators as enablers of the value\nextraction from data through the adoption of best practices. The UK data\neconomy was estimated to be near [¬£125 billion in 2021](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uks-digital-strategy/uk-digital-strategy) with an upwards trend.\nIn this context, it is essential to understand that the government-collected\nand provided open data can be crucial for addressing many of the challenges\nacross all industries.\n\nFor example, insurance providers can better assess the risk of insuring\nproperties by ingesting and integrating [Flood areas](https://environment.data.gov.uk/flood-monitoring/doc/reference#flood-areas) provided by [DEFRA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs) . On\nthe other hand, capital market investors could better understand the risk of\ntheir investments by ingesting and integrating the [Inflation Rate Index](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/timeseries/l55o/mm23) by [ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/) .\nReversely, it is crucial for regulators to have well-defined data access and\ndata sharing patterns for conducting their regulatory activities. This clarity\ntruly enables the economic actors that interact with government data.\n\n\n**2. Securing a pro-growth and trusted data regime** ‚Äî The key aspect of\nMission 2 is data trust, or more broadly, adherence to data quality norms.\nData quality considerations become further amplified for data sharing and\ndata exchange use cases where we are considering the whole ecosystem\nat once, and quality implications transcend the boundaries of our own\nplatform. This is precisely why we have to adopt ‚Äúdata sustainability.‚Äù What\nwe mean by sustainable data products are data products that harness the\nexisting sources over reinvention of the same/similar assets, accumulation of\nunnecessary data (data pollutants) and that anticipate future uses.\n\nUngoverned and unbounded data sharing could negatively impact data\nquality and hinder the growth and value of data. The quality of how the data\nis shared should be a key consideration of data quality frameworks. For\nthis reason, we require a solid set of standards and best practices for data\nsharing with governance and quality assurance built into the process and\ntechnologies. Only this way can we ensure the sustainability of our data and\nsecure a pro-growth trusted data regime.\n\n\n-----\n\n**3. Transforming government‚Äôs use of data to drive efficiency and improve**\n**public services** ‚Äî ‚ÄúBy 2025 data assets are organized and supported as\nproducts, regardless of whether they‚Äôre used by internal teams or external\ncustomers‚Ä¶ Data products continuously evolve in an agile manner to meet\nthe needs of consumers‚Ä¶ these products provide data solutions that can\nmore easily and repeatedly be used to meet various business challenges and\nreduce the time and cost of delivering new AI-driven capabilities.‚Äù ‚Äî\n[The data-driven enterprise of 2025](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-data-driven-enterprise-of-2025) by McKinsey. AI and ML can be powerful\nenablers of digital transformation for both the public and private sectors.\n\nAI, ML, reports, and dashboards are just a few examples of data products\nand services that extract value from data. The quality of these solutions is\ndirectly reflected in the quality of data used for building them and our ability\nto access and leverage available data assets both internally and externally.\nWhilst there is a vast amount of data available for us to build new intelligent\nsolutions for driving efficiency for better processes, better decision-making,\nand better policies ‚Äî there are numerous barriers that can trap the data,\nsuch as legacy systems, data silos, fragmented standards, proprietary\nformats, etc. Modeling data solutions as data products and standardizing\nthem to a unified format allows us to abstract such barriers and truly\nleverage the data ecosystem.\n\n\n**4. Ensuring the security and resilience of the infrastructure on which**\n**data relies** ‚Äî Reflecting on the vision of the year 2025 ‚Äî this isn‚Äôt that far\nfrom now and even in a not so distant future, we will be required to rethink\nour approach to data, more specifically ‚Äî what is our digital supply chain\ninfrastructure/data sharing infrastructure? Data and data assets are products\nand should be managed as products. If data is a product, we need a coherent\nand unified way of providing those products.\n\nIf data is to be used across industries and across both private and public\nsectors, we need an open protocol that drives adoption and habit generation.\nTo drive adoption, the technologies we use must be resilient, robust, trusted\nand usable by/for all. Vendor lock-in, platform lock-in or cloud lock-in are all\nboundaries to achieving this vision.\n\n**5. Championing the international flow of data** ‚Äî Data exchange between\njurisdictions and across governments will likely be one of the most\ntransformative applications of data at scale. Some of the world‚Äôs toughest\nchallenges depend on the efficient exchange of data between governments\n‚Äî prevention of criminal activities, counterterrorism activities, net-zero\nemission goals, international trade, the list goes on and on. Some steps in\nthis direction are already materializing: the U.S. federal government and UK\ngovernment have agreed on data exchange for countering serious crime\nactivities. This is a true example of championing international flow data and\nusing data for good. It is imperative that for these use cases, we approach\ndata sharing from a security-first angle. Data sharing standards and protocols\nneed to adhere to security and privacy best practices.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile originally built with a focus on the UK government and how to better\nintegrate data as a key asset of a modern government, these concepts apply in\na much wider global public sector context. In the same spirit, the U.S. Federal\nGovernment proposed the [Federal Data Strategy](https://strategy.data.gov/overview/) as a collection of principles,\npractices, action steps and timeline through which government can leverage\nthe full value of Federal data for mission, service and the public good.\n\nThe principles are grouped into three primary topics:\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Ethical governance** ‚Äî Within the domain of ethics, the sharing of data\nis a fundamental tool for promoting transparency, accountability and\nexplainability of decision-making. It is practically impossible to uphold\nethics without some form of audit conducted by an independent party.\nData (and metadata) exchange is a critical enabler for continuous robust\nprocesses that ensure we are using the data for good and we are using data\nwe can trust.\n\n\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Conscious design** ‚Äî These principles are strongly aligned with the idea of\ndata sustainability. The guidelines promote forward thinking around usability\nand interoperability of the data and user-centric design principles of\nsustainable data products.\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Learning culture** ‚Äî Data sharing, or alternatively knowledge sharing, has\nan important role in building a scalable learning ecosystem and learning\nculture. Data is front and center of knowledge synthesis, and from a\nscientific angle, data proves factual knowledge. Another critical component\nof knowledge is the ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù and data is what we need to address the\n‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù component of any decisions we make, which policy to enforce, who\nto sanction, who to support with grants, how to improve the efficiency of\ngovernment services, how to better serve citizens and society.\n\nIn contrast to afore discussed qualitative analysis of the value of data sharing\nacross governments, the European Commission forecasts the economic value\nof the European data economy will [exceed ‚Ç¨800 billion by 2027](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-data-strategy_en) ‚Äî roughly the\nsame size as the [Dutch economy in 2021](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/NAMA_10_GDP/default/table?lang=en&category=na10.nama10.nama_10_ma) ! Furthermore, they predict more than 10\nmillion data professionals in Europe alone. The technology and infrastructure to\nsupport the data society have to be accessible to all, interoperable, extensible,\nflexible and open. Imagine a world in which you‚Äôd need a different truck to\ntransport products between different warehouses because each road requires a\ndifferent set of tires ‚Äî the whole supply chain would collapse. When it comes to\ndata, we often experience the ‚Äúone set of tires for one road‚Äù paradox. Rest APIs\nand data exchange protocols have been proposed in the past but have failed\nto address the need for simplicity, ease of use and cost of scaling up with the\nnumber of data products.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Delta Sharing ‚Äî the new data**\n**highway**\n\nDelta Sharing provides an open protocol for\nsecure data sharing to any computing platform.\nThe protocol is based on Delta data format and is\nagnostic concerning the cloud of choice.\n\nDelta is an open source data format that avoids\nvendor, platform and cloud lock-in, thus fully\nadhering to the principles of data sustainability,\nconscious design of the U.S. Federal Data Strategy\nand mission 4 of the UK National Data Strategy.\nDelta provides a governance layer on top of the\nParquet data format. Furthermore, it provides many\nperformance optimizations not available in Parquet\nout of the box. The openness of the data format\nis a critical consideration. It is the main factor for\ndriving the habit generation and adoption of best\npractices and standards.\n\n\n-----\n\nDelta Sharing is a protocol based on a lean set of REST APIs to manage sharing,\npermissions and access to any data asset stored in Delta or Parquet formats.\nThe protocol defines two main actors, the data provider (data supplier, data\nowner) and the data recipient (data consumer). The recipient, by definition, is\nagnostic to the data format at the source. Delta Sharing provides the necessary\nabstractions for governed data access in many different languages and tools.\n\nDelta Sharing is uniquely positioned to answer many of the challenges of data\nsharing in a scalable manner within the context of highly regulated domains like\nthe public sector:\n\n**‚Ä¢ Privacy and security concerns** ‚Äî Personally identifiable data or otherwise\nsensitive or restricted data is a major part of the data exchange needs of a\ndata-driven and modernized government. Given the sensitive nature of such\ndata, it is paramount that the governance of data sharing is maintained in a\ncoherent and unified manner. Any unnecessary process and technological\ncomplexities increase the risk of over-sharing data. With this in mind,\nDelta Sharing has been designed with [security best practices](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/08/01/security-best-practices-for-delta-sharing.html) from the\nvery inception. The protocol provides end-to-end encryption, short-lived\ncredentials, and accessible and intuitive audit and governance features. All\nof these capabilities are available in a centralized way across all your Delta\ntables across all clouds.\n\n**‚Ä¢ Quality and accuracy** ‚Äî Another challenge of data sharing is ensuring\nthat the data being shared is of high quality and accuracy. Given that\nthe underlying data is stored as Delta tables, we can guarantee that the\n[transactional nature of data](https://docs.delta.io/latest/concurrency-control.html#concurrency-control) is respected; Delta ensures ACID properties\nof data. Furthermore, Delta supports [data constraints](https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-constraints.html#constraints) to guarantee data\n\n\nquality requirements at storage. Unfortunately, other formats such as [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) ,\n[CSVW](https://csvw.org/) , [ORC](https://www.google.com/search?q=orc+data+format&rlz=1C5GCEM_enGB931GB932&ei=CzHRY6KqI4S78gL7hoigCw&oq=ORC+da&gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQARgAMgUIABCRAjIFCAAQkQIyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIHCAAQgAQQCjIHCAAQgAQQCjIHCAAQgAQQCjIHCAAQgAQQCjIHCAAQgAQQCjIHCAAQgAQQCjoKCAAQRxDWBBCwAzoHCAAQsAMQQzoNCAAQ5AIQ1gQQsAMYAToPCC4Q1AIQyAMQsAMQQxgCOgwILhDIAxCwAxBDGAI6FQguEMcBENEDENQCEMgDELADEEMYAjoECAAQQzoGCAAQChBDOgoIABCxAxCDARBDOgcIABCxAxBDSgQIQRgASgQIRhgBUCxY3AJg3QxoAXABeACAAW6IAbgCkgEDMC4zmAEAoAEByAETwAEB2gEGCAEQARgJ2gEGCAIQARgI&sclient=gws-wiz-serp) , [Avro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Avro) , [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) , etc., do not have such properties without significant\nadditional effort. The issue becomes even more emphasized by the fact\nthat data quality cannot be ensured in the same way on both the data\nprovider and data recipient side without the exact reimplementation of the\nsource systems. It is critical to embed quality and metadata together with\ndata to ensure quality travels together with data. Any decoupled approach\nto managing data, metadata and quality separately increases the risk of\nsharing and can lead to undesirable outcomes.\n\n**‚Ä¢ Lack of standardization** ‚Äî Another challenge of data sharing is the lack\nof standardization in how data is collected, organized, and stored. This is\nparticularly pronounced in the context of governmental activities. While\ngovernments have proposed standard formats (e.g., Office for National\nStatistics [promotes usage of CSVW](https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/transparencyandgovernance/datastrategy/datastandards#metadata-exchange) ), aligning all private and public\nsector companies to standards proposed by such initiatives is a massive\nchallenge. Other industries may have different requirements for scalability,\ninteroperability, format complexity, lack of structure in data, etc. Most of\nthe currently advocated standards are lacking in multiple such aspects.\nDelta is the most mature candidate for assuming the central role in the\nstandardization of data exchange format. It has been built as a transactional\nand scalable data format, it supports structured, semi-structured and\nunstructured data, it stores data schema and metadata together with data\nand it provides a scalable enterprise-grade sharing protocol through Delta\nSharing. Finally, Delta is one of the most popular open source projects\nin the ecosystem and, since May 2022, has surpassed [7 million monthly](https://delta.io/blog/2022-08-02-delta-2-0-the-foundation-of-your-data-lake-is-open/)\n[downloads](https://delta.io/blog/2022-08-02-delta-2-0-the-foundation-of-your-data-lake-is-open/) .\n\n\n-----\n\n**‚Ä¢ Cultural and organizational barriers** ‚Äî These challenges can be\nsummarized by one word: friction. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs a common problem\nfor civil servants to struggle to obtain access to both internal and external\ndata due to over-cumbersome processes, policies and outdated standards.\nThe principles we are using to build our data platforms and our data sharing\nplatforms have to be self-promoting, have to drive adoption and have to\ngenerate habits that adhere to best practices.\n\nIf there is friction with standard adoption, the only way to ensure standards\nare respected is by enforcement and that itself is yet another barrier to\nachieving data sustainability. Organizations have already adopted Delta\nSharing both in the private and public sectors. For example, [U.S. Citizenship](https://www.uscis.gov/)\n[and Immigration Services](https://www.uscis.gov/) (USCIS) uses Delta Sharing to satisfy several\n[interagency data-sharing](https://delta.io/blog/2022-12-08-data-sharing-across-government-delta-sharing/) requirements. Similarly, Nasdaq describes Delta\nSharing as the ‚Äú [future of financial data sharing,](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/delta-sharing-protocol%3A-the-evolution-of-financial-data-sharing-2021-05-26) ‚Äù and that future is open\nand governed.\n\n\n\n**‚Ä¢ Technical challenges** ‚Äî Federation at the government scale or even\nfurther across multiple industries and geographies poses technical\nchallenges. Each organization within this federation owns its platform\nand drives technological, architectural, platform and tooling choices.\n\nHow can we promote interoperability and data exchange in this vast,\ndiverse technological ecosystem? The data is the only viable integration\nvehicle. As long as the data formats we utilize are scalable, open and\ngoverned, we can use them to abstract from individual platforms and\ntheir intrinsic complexities.\n\nDelta format and Delta Sharing solve this wide array of requirements and\nchallenges in a scalable, robust and open way. This positions Delta Sharing\nas the strongest choice for unification and simplification of the protocol and\nmechanism through which we share data across both private and public sectors.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Data Sharing through data clean rooms**\n\n\n[Data clean rooms](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/06/28/introducing-data-cleanrooms-for-the-lakehouse.html) address this particular need. With data clean rooms you can\nshare data with third parties in a privacy-safe environment. With Unity Catalog ,\nyou can enable fine-grained access controls on the data and meet your privacy\nrequirements. In this architecture, the data participants never get access to\nthe raw data. The only outputs from the clean rooms are those data assets\ngenerated in a pre-agreed, governed and fully controlled manner that ensures\ncompliance with the requirements of all parties involved.\n\nFinally, data clean rooms and Delta Sharing can address hybrid on-premise-offpremise deployments, where the data with the most restricted access remains\non the premise. In contrast, less restricted data is free to leverage the power\nof the cloud offerings. In said scenario, there may be a need to combine the\npower of the cloud with the restricted data to solve advanced use cases where\ncapabilities are unavailable on the on-premises data platforms. Data clean rooms\ncan ensure that no physical data copies of the raw restricted data are created,\nresults are produced within the clean room‚Äôs controlled environment and results\nare shared back to the on-premises environment (if the results maintain the\nrestricted access within the defined policies) or are forwarded to any other\ncompliant and predetermined destination system.\n\n\nTaking the complexities of data sharing within highly regulated space and the\npublic sector one step further ‚Äî what if we require to share the knowledge\ncontained in the data without ever granting direct access to the source data to\nexternal parties? These requirements may prove achievable and desirable where\nthe data sharing risk appetite is very low.\n\nIn many public sector contexts, there are concerns that combining the data that\ndescribes citizens could lead to a big brother scenario where simply too much\ndata about an individual is concentrated in a single data asset. If it were to fall\ninto the wrong hands, such a hypothetical data asset could lead to immeasurable\nconsequences for individuals and the trust in public sector services could\nerode. On the other hand, the value of a 360 view of the citizen could accelerate\nimportant decision-making. It could immensely improve the quality of policies\nand services provided to the citizens.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Citizen value of data sharing**\n\nEvery decision made by the government is a decision that affects its citizens.\nWhether the decision is a change to a policy, granting a benefit or preventing\ncrime, it can significantly influence the quality of our society. Data is a key factor\nin making the right decisions and justifying the decisions made. Simply put,\nwe can‚Äôt expect high-quality decisions without the high quality of data and a\ncomplete view of the data (within the permitted context). Without data sharing,\nwe will remain in a highly fragmented position where our ability to make those\ndecisions is severely limited or even completely compromised. In this blog, we\nhave covered several technological solutions available within the lakehouse that\ncan derisk and accelerate how the government is leveraging the data ecosystem\nin a sustainable and scalable way.\n\nFor more details on the industry use cases that Delta Sharing is addressing\nplease consult [A New Approach to Data Sharing](https://www.databricks.com/product/unity-catalog) eBook.\n\n**Start experimenting with these**\n**free Databricks** **notebooks** **.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**SECTION**\n\n# 03\n\n\n### Ready-to-Use Notebooks  and Data Sets\n\n\n-----\n\n**Digital Twins**\n\nLeverage digital twins ‚Äî virtual\nrepresentations of devices and\nobjects ‚Äî to optimize operations and\ngain insights\n\n\nThis section includes several Solution Accelerators ‚Äî free, ready-to-use\n\nexamples of data solutions from different industries ranging from retail to\n\nmanufacturing and healthcare.

The company sought to improve ingestion and query speed\nto meet those SLAs. ‚ÄúData needs to be as real-time as possible so customers\ncan see what is attacking them,‚Äù says Tomer Patel, Engineering Manager at\nAkamai. ‚ÄúProviding queryable data to customers quickly is critical. We wanted to\nmove away from on-prem to improve performance and our SLAs so the latency\nwould be seconds rather than minutes.‚Äù\n\n**Delta Lake allows us to not only query the data better but to**\n**also acquire an increase in the data volume. We‚Äôve seen an**\n**80% increase in traffic and data in the last year, so being able**\n**to scale fast is critical.**\n\n\nAfter conducting proofs of concept with several companies, Akamai chose to\nbase its streaming analytics architecture on Spark and the Databricks Lakehouse\nPlatform. ‚ÄúBecause of our scale and the demands of our SLA, we determined that\nDatabricks was the right solution for us,‚Äù says Patel. ‚ÄúWhen we consider storage\noptimization, and data caching, if we went with another solution, we couldn‚Äôt\nachieve the same level of performance.‚Äù\n\n**Improving speed and reducing costs**\n\nToday, the web security analytics tool ingests and transforms data, stores it\nin cloud storage, and sends the location of the file via Kafka. It then uses a\nDatabricks Job as the ingest application. Delta Lake, the open source storage\nformat at the base of the Databricks Lakehouse Platform, supports real-time\nquerying on the web security analytics data. Delta Lake also enables Akamai to\nscale quickly. ‚ÄúDelta Lake allows us to not only query the data better but to also\nacquire an increase in the data volume,‚Äù says Patel. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen an 80% increase\nin traffic and data in the last year, so being able to scale fast is critical.‚Äù\n\nAkamai also uses Databricks SQL (DBSQL) and Photon, which provide extremely\n\nfast query performance. Patel added that Photon provided a significant boost\nto query performance. Overall, Databricks‚Äô streaming architecture combined\nwith DBSQL and Photon enables Akamai to achieve real-time analytics, which\ntranslates to real-time business benefits.\n\n\n**Tomer Patel**\nEngineering Manager, Akamai\n\n\n-----\n\nPatel says he likes that Delta Lake is open source, as the company has benefitted\nfrom a community of users working to improve the product. ‚ÄúThe fact that Delta\nLake is open source and there‚Äôs a big community behind it means we don‚Äôt need\nto implement everything ourselves,‚Äù says Patel. ‚ÄúWe benefit from fixed bugs that\nothers have encountered and from optimizations that are contributed to the\nproject.‚Äù Akamai worked closely with Databricks to ensure Delta Lake can meet\nthe scale and performance requirements Akamai defined. These improvements\nhave been contributed back to the project (many of which were made available as\npart of Delta Lake 2.0), and so any user running Delta Lake now benefits from the\ntechnology being tested at such a large scale in a real-world production scenario.\n\n\n**Meeting aggressive requirements for scale,**\n**reliability and performance**\n\nUsing Spark Structured Streaming on the Databricks Lakehouse Platform enables\nthe web security analytics tool to stream vast volumes of data and provide\nlow-latency, real-time analytics-as-a-service to Akamai‚Äôs customers. That way\nAkamai is able to make available security event data to customers within the\nSLA of 5 to 7 minutes from when an attack occurs. ‚ÄúOur focus is performance,\nperformance, performance,‚Äù says Patel. ‚ÄúThe platform‚Äôs performance and\nscalability are what drives us.‚Äù\n\nUsing the Databricks Lakehouse Platform, it now takes under 1 minute to ingest\nthe security event data. ‚ÄúReducing ingestion time from 15 minutes to under 1\nminute is a huge improvement,‚Äù says Patel. ‚ÄúIt benefits our customers because\nthey can see the security event data faster and they have a view of what exactly\nis happening as well as the capability to filter all of it.‚Äù\n\nAkamai‚Äôs biggest priority is to provide customers with a good experience and\nfast response times. To date, Akamai has moved about 70% of security event\ndata from its on-prem architecture to Databricks, and the SLA for customer\nquery and response time has improved significantly as a result. ‚ÄúNow, with the\nmove to Databricks, our customers experience much better response time, with\nover 85% of queries completing under 7 seconds.‚Äù Providing that kind of realtime data means Akamai can help its customers stay vigilant and maintain an\noptimal security configuration.\n\n\n-----\n\nSECTION 4.2\n**Grammarly uses Databricks Lakehouse to improve**\n**user experience**\n\n\n###### 110%\n\n**Faster querying, at 10% of the cost**\n**to ingest, than a data warehouse**\n\n\n###### 5 billion\n\n**Daily events available for**\n**analytics in under 15 minutes**\n\n\nGrammarly‚Äôs mission is to improve lives by improving communication.

Grammarly receives feedback when users accept, reject\nor ignore its suggestions through app-created events, which total about 5 billion\nevents per day.\n\nHistorically, Grammarly relied on a homegrown legacy analytics platform and\nleveraged an in-house SQL-like language that was time-intensive to learn and\nmade it challenging to onboard new hires. As the company grew, Grammarly\ndata analysts found that the platform did not sufficiently meet the needs of its\nessential business functions, especially marketing, sales and customer success.\nAnalysts found themselves copying and pasting data from spreadsheets\nbecause the existing system couldn‚Äôt effectively ingest the external data needed\nto answer questions such as, ‚ÄúWhich marketing channel delivers the highest\nROI?‚Äù Reporting proved challenging because the existing system didn‚Äôt support\nTableau dashboards, and company leaders and analysts needed to ensure they\ncould make decisions quickly and confidently.\n\n\n**Databricks Lakehouse has given us the flexibility to unleash**\n**our data without compromise. That flexibility has allowed us**\n**to speed up analytics to a pace we‚Äôve never achieved before.**\n\n**Chris Locklin**\nEngineering Manager, Data Platforms, Grammarly\n\nGrammarly also sought to unify its data warehouses in order to scale and\nimprove data storage and query capabilities. As it stood, large Amazon EMR\nclusters ran 24/7 and drove up costs. With the various data sources, the team\nalso needed to maintain access control. ‚ÄúAccess control in a distributed file\nsystem is difficult, and it only gets more complicated as you ingest more data\nsources,‚Äù says Chris Locklin, Engineering Manager, Data Platforms at Grammarly.\nMeanwhile, reliance on a single streaming workflow made collaboration among\nteams challenging. Data silos emerged as different business areas implemented\nanalytics tools individually. ‚ÄúEvery team decided to solve their analytics needs in\nthe best way they saw fit,‚Äù says Locklin. ‚ÄúThat created challenges in consistency\nand knowing which data set was correct.‚Äù\n\n\n-----\n\nAs its data strategy was evolving, Grammarly‚Äôs priority was to get the most out\nof analytical data while keeping it secure. This was crucial because security is\nGrammarly‚Äôs number-one priority and most important feature, both in how it\nprotects its users‚Äô data and how it ensures its own company data remains secure.\nTo accomplish that, Grammarly‚Äôs data platform team sought to consolidate\ndata and unify the company on a single platform. That meant sustaining a highly\nsecure infrastructure that could scale alongside the company‚Äôs growth, improving\ningestion flexibility, reducing costs and fueling collaboration.\n\n**Improving analytics, visualization and decision-making**\n**with the lakehouse**\n\nAfter conducting several proofs of concept to enhance its infrastructure,\nGrammarly migrated to the Databricks Lakehouse Platform. Bringing all the\nanalytical data into the lakehouse created a central hub for all data producers\nand consumers across Grammarly, with Delta Lake at the core.\n\nUsing the lakehouse architecture, data analysts within Grammarly now have a\nconsolidated interface for analytics, which leads to a single source of truth and\n\nconfidence in the accuracy and availability of all data managed by the data\nplatform team. Across the organization, teams are using Databricks SQL to\nconduct queries within the platform on both internally generated product data\nand external data from digital advertising platform partners. Now, they can easily\nconnect to Tableau and create dashboards and visualizations to present to\nexecutives and key stakeholders.\n\n\n‚ÄúSecurity is of utmost importance at Grammarly, and our team‚Äôs numberone objective is to own and protect our analytical data,‚Äù says Locklin. ‚ÄúOther\ncompanies ask for your data, hold it for you, and then let you perform analytics\non it. Just as Grammarly ensures our users‚Äô data always remains theirs, we\nwanted to ensure our company data remained ours. Grammarly‚Äôs data stays\ninside of Grammarly.‚Äù\n\nWith its data consolidated in the lakehouse, different areas of Grammarly‚Äôs\nbusiness can now analyze data more thoroughly and effectively. For example,\nGrammarly‚Äôs marketing team uses advertising to attract new business. Using\nDatabricks, the team can consolidate data from various sources to extrapolate\na user‚Äôs lifetime value, compare it with customer acquisition costs and get rapid\nfeedback on campaigns. Elsewhere, data captured from user interactions flow\ninto a set of tables used by analysts for ad hoc analysis to inform and improve\nthe user experience.\n\nBy consolidating data onto one unified platform, Grammarly has eliminated data\nsilos. ‚ÄúThe ability to bring all these capabilities, data processing and analysis\nunder the same platform using Databricks is extremely valuable,‚Äù says Sergey\nBlanket, Head of Business Intelligence at Grammarly. ‚ÄúDoing everything from ETL\nand engineering to analytics and ML under the same umbrella removes barriers\nand makes it easy for everyone to work with the data and each other.‚Äù\n\n\n-----\n\nTo manage access control, enable end-to-end observability and monitor data\nquality, Grammarly relies on the data lineage capabilities within Unity Catalog.\n‚ÄúData lineage allows us to effectively monitor usage of our data and ensure it\nupholds the standards we set as a data platform team,‚Äù says Locklin. ‚ÄúLineage is\nthe last crucial piece for access control. It allows analysts to leverage data to do\ntheir jobs while adhering to all usage standards and access controls, even when\nrecreating tables and data sets in another environment.‚Äù\n\n**Faster time to insight drives more intelligent**\n**business decisions**\n\nUsing the Databricks Lakehouse Platform, Grammarly‚Äôs engineering teams now\nhave a tailored, centralized platform and a consistent data source across the\ncompany, resulting in greater speed and efficiency and reduced costs. The\nlakehouse architecture has led to 110% faster querying, at 10% of the cost to\ningest, than a data warehouse. Grammarly can now make its 5 billion daily events\navailable for analytics in under 15 minutes rather than 4 hours, enabling lowlatency data aggregation and query optimization. This allows the team to quickly\n\nreceive feedback about new features being rolled out and understand if they are\nbeing adopted as expected. Ultimately, it helps them understand how groups\nof users engage with the UX, improving the experience and ensuring features\nand product releases bring the most value to users. ‚ÄúEverything my team does\nis focused on creating a rich, personalized experience that empowers people to\ncommunicate more effectively and achieve their potential,‚Äù says Locklin.\n\n\nMoving to the lakehouse architecture also solved the challenge of access control\nover distributed file systems, while Unity Catalog enabled fine-grained, rolebased access controls and real-time data lineage. ‚ÄúUnity Catalog gives us the\nability to manage file permissions with more flexibility than a database would\nallow,‚Äù says Locklin. ‚ÄúIt solved a problem my team couldn‚Äôt solve at scale. While\nusing Databricks allows us to keep analytical data in-house, Unity Catalog helps\nus continue to uphold the highest standards of data protection by controlling\naccess paradigms inside our data. That opens a whole new world of things that\nwe can do.‚Äù\n\nUltimately, migrating to the Databricks Lakehouse Platform has helped\nGrammarly to foster a data-driven culture where employees get fast access\nto analytics without having to write complex queries, all while maintaining\nGrammarly‚Äôs enterprise-grade security practices. ‚ÄúOur team‚Äôs mission is to help\nGrammarly make better, faster business decisions,‚Äù adds Blanket. ‚ÄúMy team\nwould not be able to effectively execute on that mission if we did not have a\nplatform like Databricks available to us.‚Äù Perhaps most critically, migrating off its\nrigid legacy infrastructure gives Grammarly the adaptability to do more while\nknowing the platform will evolve as its needs evolve. ‚ÄúDatabricks has given us the\nflexibility to unleash our data without compromise,‚Äù says Locklin. ‚ÄúThat flexibility\nhas allowed us to speed up analytics to a pace we‚Äôve never achieved before.‚Äù\n\n\n-----\n\nSECTION 4.3\n**Honeywell selects Delta Live Tables for streaming data**\n\nCompanies are under growing pressure to reduce energy use, while at the same time\n\nthey are looking to lower costs and improve efficiency. Honeywell delivers industry-\n\nspecific solutions that include aerospace products and services, control technologies\n\nfor buildings and industry, and performance materials globally. Honeywell‚Äôs Energy\n\nand Environmental Solutions division uses IoT sensors and other technologies to help\n\nbusinesses worldwide manage energy demand, reduce energy consumption and carbon\n\nemissions, optimize indoor air quality, and improve occupant well-being.\n\nAccomplishing this requires Honeywell to collect vast amounts of data. Using Delta Live\n\nTables on the Databricks Lakehouse Platform, Honeywell‚Äôs data team can now ingest\n\nbillions of rows of sensor data into Delta Lake and automatically build SQL endpoints for\n\nreal-time queries and multilayer insights into data at scale ‚Äî helping Honeywell improve\n\nhow it manages data and extract more value from it, both for itself and for its customers.\n\n\n**I N D U S T R Y**\n[Manufacturing](https://databricks.com/solutions/industries/manufacturing-industry-solutions)\n\n**P L AT F O R M U S E C A S E**\nLakehouse, Delta Lake, Delta Live Tables\n\n\n**C LO U D**\n[Azure](https://databricks.com/product/azure) **Databricks helps us pull together many different data sources, do**\n**aggregations, and bring the significant amount of data we collect**\n**from our buildings under control so we can provide customers value.**\n\n**Dr. Chris Inkpen**\nGlobal Solutions Architect, Honeywell Energy and Environmental Solutions\n\n\n-----\n\n**Processing billions of IoT data points per day**\n\nHoneywell‚Äôs solutions and services are used in millions of buildings around the\nworld. Helping its customers create buildings that are safe, more sustainable\nand productive can require thousands of sensors per building. Those sensors\nmonitor key factors such as temperature, pressure, humidity and air quality.\nIn addition to the data collected by sensors inside a building, data is also\ncollected from outside, such as weather and pollution data. Another data set\nconsists of information about the buildings themselves ‚Äî such as building\ntype, ownership, floor plan, square footage of each floor and square footage\nof each room. That data set is combined with the two disparate data streams,\nadding up to a lot of data across multiple structured and unstructured formats,\nincluding images and video streams, telemetry data, event data, etc. At peaks,\nHoneywell ingests anywhere between 200 to 1,000 events per second for any\nbuilding, which equates to billions of data points per day. Honeywell‚Äôs existing\ndata infrastructure was challenged to meet such demand. It also made it difficult\nfor Honeywell‚Äôs data team to query and visualize its disparate data so it could\nprovide customers with fast, high-quality information and analysis.\n\n**ETL simplified: high-quality, reusable data pipelines**\n\nWith Delta Live Tables (DLT) on the Databricks Lakehouse Platform, Honeywell‚Äôs\ndata team can now ingest billions of rows of sensor data into Delta Lake and\nautomatically build SQL endpoints for real-time queries and multilayer insights\ninto data at scale. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt have to do anything to get DLT to scale,‚Äù says Dr.\n\n\nChris Inkpen, Global Solutions Architect at Honeywell Energy and Environmental\nSolutions. ‚ÄúWe give the system more data, and it copes. Out of the box, it‚Äôs given\nus the confidence that it will handle whatever we throw at it.‚Äù\n\nHoneywell credits the Databricks Lakehouse Platform for helping it to unify its\nvast and varied data ‚Äî batch, streaming, structured and unstructured ‚Äî into\none platform. ‚ÄúWe have many different data types. The Databricks Lakehouse\nPlatform allows us to use things like Apache Kafka and Auto Loader to load and\nprocess multiple types of data and treat everything as a stream of data, which is\nawesome. Once we‚Äôve got structured data from unstructured data, we can write\nstandardized pipelines.‚Äù\n\nHoneywell data engineers can now build and leverage their own ETL pipelines\nwith Delta Live Tables and gain insights and analytics quickly. ETL pipelines can\nbe reused regardless of environment, and data can run in batches or streams. It‚Äôs\nalso helped Honeywell‚Äôs data team transition from a small team to a larger team.\n‚ÄúWhen we wrote our first few pipelines before DLT existed, only one person could\nwork in one part of the functionality. Now that we‚Äôve got DLT and the ability to\nhave folders with common functionality, we‚Äôve got a really good platform where\nwe can easily spin off different pipelines.‚Äù\n\nDLT also helped Honeywell establish standard log files to monitor and costjustify its product pipelines. ‚ÄúUtilizing DLT, we can analyze which parts of our\npipeline need optimization,‚Äù says Inkpen. ‚ÄúWith standard pipelines, that was\nmuch more chaotic.‚Äù\n\n\n-----\n\n**Enabling ease, simplicity and scalability across the**\n**infrastructure**\n\nDelta Live Tables has helped Honeywell‚Äôs data team consistently query\ncomplex data while offering simplicity of scale. It also enables end-to-end data\nvisualization of Honeywell‚Äôs data streams as they flow into its infrastructure, are\ntransformed, and then flow out. ‚ÄúNinety percent of our ETL is now captured in\ndiagrams, so that‚Äôs helped considerably and improves data governance. DLT\nencourages ‚Äî and almost enforces ‚Äî good design,‚Äù says Inkpen.\n\nUsing the lakehouse as a shared workspace has helped promote teamwork and\ncollaboration at Honeywell. ‚ÄúThe team collaborates beautifully now, working\ntogether every day to divvy up the pipeline into their own stories and workloads,‚Äù\nsays Inkpen.\n\nMeanwhile, the ability to manage streaming data with low latency and better\nthroughput has improved accuracy and reduced costs. ‚ÄúOnce we‚Äôve designed\nsomething using DLT, we‚Äôre pretty safe from scalability issues ‚Äî certainly a\nhundred times better than if we hadn‚Äôt written it in DLT,‚Äù says Inkpen. ‚ÄúWe can\nthen go back and look at how we can take a traditional job and make it more\nperformant and less costly. We‚Äôre in a much better position to try and do that\nfrom DLT.‚Äù\n\n\nUsing Databricks and DLT also helps the Honeywell team perform with greater\nagility, which allows them to innovate faster while empowering developers to\nrespond to user requirements almost immediately. ‚ÄúOur previous architecture\nmade it impossible to know what bottlenecks we had and what we needed to\nscale. Now we can do data science in near real-time.‚Äù\n\nUltimately, Honeywell can now more quickly provide its customers with the\ndata and analysis they need to make their buildings more efficient, healthier\nand safer for occupants. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm continuously looking for ways to improve our\nlifecycles, time to market, and data quality,‚Äù says Inkpen. ‚ÄúDatabricks helps\nus pull together many different data sources, do aggregations, and bring the\nsignificant amount of data we collect from our buildings under control so we\ncan provide customers value.‚Äù\n\n**Ready to get started?

Using [Databricks Workflows](https://www.databricks.com/product/workflows) , the team defined a common\nworkstream that the entire team uses. Each stage of the pipeline is implemented\nin a Python notebook, which is run as a job in the main workflow.\n\nEach team member can now see exactly what code is running on each stage,\nmaking it easy to find the cause of the issue. Knowing who owns the part of the\npipeline that originated the problem makes fixing issues much faster. ‚ÄúWithout\na common workflow, different members of the team would run their notebooks\nindependently, not knowing that failure in their run affected stages downstream,‚Äù\nsays Meng Zhang, Principal Data Analyst at Wood Mackenzie. ‚ÄúWhen trying to\nrerun notebooks, it was hard to tell which notebook version was initially run and\nthe latest version to use.‚Äù\n\n\n**Yanyan Wu**\nVice President of Data, Wood Mackenzie\n\n\n-----\n\nUsing Workflows‚Äô alerting capabilities to notify the team when a workflow task\nfails ensures everyone knows a failure occurred and allows the team to work\ntogether to resolve the issue quickly. The definition of a common workflow\ncreated consistency and transparency that made collaboration easier. ‚ÄúUsing\nDatabricks Workflows allowed us to encourage collaboration and break up the\nwalls between different stages of the process,‚Äù explains Wu. ‚ÄúIt allowed us all to\nspeak the same language.‚Äù\n\nCreating transparency and consistency is not the only advantage the team saw.\nUsing Workflows to automate notebook runs also led to cost savings compared\nto running interactive notebooks manually.\n\n**Improved code development productivity**\n\nThe team‚Äôs ETL pipeline development process involves iteration on PySpark\nnotebooks. Leveraging [interactive notebooks](https://www.databricks.com/product/collaborative-notebooks) in the Databricks UI makes it easy\nfor data professionals on the team to manually develop and test a notebook.\nBecause Databricks Workflows supports running notebooks as task type\n(along with Python files, JAR files and other types), when the code is ready for\n\n\ndeveloping notebooks with the interactive notebook UI while leveraging the\npower of automation, which reduces potential issues that may happen when\nrunning notebooks manually.\n\nThe team has gone even further in increasing productivity by developing a\nCI/CD process. ‚ÄúBy connecting our source control code repository, we know\nthe workflow always runs the latest code version we committed to the repo,‚Äù\nexplains Zhang. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also easy to switch to a development branch to develop a\nnew feature, fix a bug and run a development workflow. When the code passes\nall tests, it is merged back to the main branch and the production workflow is\nautomatically updated with the latest code.‚Äù\n\nGoing forward, Wood Mackenzie plans to optimize its use of Databricks\nWorkflows to automate machine learning processes such as model training,\nmodel monitoring and handling model drift.

Each vehicle uses IoT sensors and cameras to\ncapture petabytes of data ranging from how the vehicle drives to how various\nparts function. With all this data at its fingertips, Rivian is using machine learning\nto improve the overall customer experience with predictive maintenance so that\npotential issues are addressed before they impact the driver.\n\nBefore Rivian even shipped its first EAV, it was already up against data visibility\nand tooling limitations that decreased output, prevented collaboration and\nincreased operational costs. It had 30 to 50 large and operationally complicated\ncompute clusters at any given time, which was costly. Not only was the system\ndifficult to manage, but the company experienced frequent cluster outages\nas well, forcing teams to dedicate more time to troubleshooting than to data\nanalysis. Additionally, data silos created by disjointed systems slowed the\n\n\n-----\n\n**Predicting maintenance issues with Databricks Lakehouse**\n\nRivian chose to modernize its data infrastructure on the Databricks Lakehouse\nPlatform, giving it the ability to unify all of its data into a common view for\ndownstream analytics and machine learning. Now, unique data teams have\na range of accessible tools to deliver actionable insights for different use\ncases, from predictive maintenance to smarter product development. Venkat\nSivasubramanian, Senior Director of Big Data at Rivian, says, ‚ÄúWe were able\nto build a culture around an open data platform that provided a system for\nreally democratizing data and analysis in an efficient way.‚Äù Databricks‚Äô flexible\nsupport of all programming languages and seamless integration with a variety of\ntoolsets eliminated access roadblocks and unlocked new opportunities. Wassym\nBensaid, Vice President of Software Development at Rivian, explains, ‚ÄúToday we\nhave various teams, both technical and business, using Databricks Lakehouse\nto explore our data, build performant data pipelines, and extract actionable\nbusiness and product insights via visual dashboards.‚Äù\n\n\nmetrics, Rivian can improve the accuracy of smart features and the control\nthat drivers have over them. Designed to take the stress out of long drives and\ndriving in heavy traffic, features like adaptive cruise control, lane change assist,\nautomatic emergency driving, and forward collision warning can be honed over\ntime to continuously optimize the driving experience for customers.\n\nSecure data sharing and collaboration was also facilitated with the Databricks\nUnity Catalog. Shiverick describes how unified governance for the lakehouse\nbenefits Rivian productivity. ‚ÄúUnity Catalog gives us a truly centralized data\ncatalog across all of our different teams,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNow we have proper access\nmanagement and controls.‚Äù Venkat adds, ‚ÄúWith Unity Catalog, we are centralizing\ndata catalog and access management across various teams and workspaces,\nwhich has simplified governance.‚Äù End-to-end version controlled governance\nand auditability of sensitive data sources, like the ones used for autonomous\ndriving systems, produces a simple but secure solution for feature engineering.\nThis gives Rivian a competitive advantage in the race to capture the autonomous\ndriving grid.\n\n\nRivian‚Äôs ADAS (advanced driver-assistance systems) Team can now easily\nprepare telemetric accelerometer data to understand all EAV motions. This core\nrecording data includes information about pitch, roll, speed, suspension and\nairbag activity, to help Rivian understand vehicle performance, driving patterns\nand connected car system predictability. Based on these key performance\n\n\n-----\n\n**Accelerating into an electrified and sustainable world**\n\n\nBy scaling its capacity to deliver valuable data insights with speed, efficiency\nand cost-effectiveness, Rivian is primed to leverage more data to improve\noperations and the performance of its vehicles to enhance the customer\nexperience. Venkat says, ‚ÄúThe flexibility that lakehouse offers saves us a lot of\nmoney from a cloud perspective, and that‚Äôs a huge win for us.‚Äù With Databricks\nLakehouse providing a unified and open source approach to data and analytics,\nthe Vehicle Reliability Team is able to better understand how people are using\ntheir vehicles, and that helps to inform the design of future generations of\nvehicles. By leveraging the Databricks Lakehouse Platform, they have seen a\n30%‚Äì50% increase in runtime performance, which has led to faster insights and\nmodel performance.\n\nShiverick explains, ‚ÄúFrom a reliability standpoint, we can make sure that\ncomponents will withstand appropriate lifecycles. It can be as simple as\nmaking sure door handles are beefy enough to endure constant usage, or as\ncomplicated as predictive and preventative maintenance to eliminate the\nchance of failure in the field. Generally speaking, we‚Äôre improving software quality\nbased on key vehicle metrics for a better customer experience.‚Äù\n\n\nFrom a design optimization perspective, Rivian‚Äôs unobstructed data view is also\nproducing new diagnostic insights that can improve fleet health, safety, stability\nand security. Venkat says, ‚ÄúWe can perform remote diagnostics to triage a\nproblem quickly, or have a mobile service come in, or potentially send an OTA\nto fix the problem with the software. All of this needs so much visibility into\nthe data, and that‚Äôs been possible with our partnership and integration on the\nplatform itself.‚Äù With developers actively building vehicle software to improve\nissues along the way.\n\nMoving forward, Rivian is seeing rapid adoption of Databricks Lakehouse across\ndifferent teams ‚Äî increasing the number of platform users from 5 to 250 in only\none year. This has unlocked new use cases including using machine learning to\noptimize battery efficiency in colder temperatures, increasing the accuracy of\nautonomous driving systems, and serving commercial depots with vehicle health\ndashboards for early and ongoing maintenance. As more EAVs ship, and its fleet\nof commercial vans expands, Rivian will continue to leverage the troves of data\ngenerated by its EAVs to deliver new innovations and driving experiences that\nrevolutionize sustainable transportation.\n\n\n-----\n\nSECTION 4.6\n**Migrating to the cloud to better serve**\n**millions of customers**\n\n\n###### 300%\n\n**ROI from OpEx savings**\n**and cost avoidance**\n\n\n###### 3X\n\n**Faster delivery of ML/data**\n**science use cases**\n\n\nConsistency in innovation is what keeps customers with a telecommunications company\n\nand is why AT&T is ranked among the best. However, AT&T‚Äôs massive on-premises legacy\n\nHadoop system proved complex and costly to manage, impeding operational agility\n\nand efficiency and engineering resources. The need to pivot to cloud to better support\n\nhundreds of millions of subscribers was apparent.\n\nMigrating from Hadoop to Databricks on the Azure cloud, AT&T experienced significant\n\nsavings in operating costs. Additionally, the new cloud-based environment has unlocked\n\naccess to petabytes of data for correlative analytics and an AI-as-a-Service offering for\n\n2,500+ users across 60+ business units. AT&T can now leverage all its data ‚Äî without\n\noverburdening its engineering team or exploding operational costs ‚Äî to deliver new\n\nfeatures and innovations to its millions of end users.\n\n\n**I N D U S T R Y**\n[Communication Service Providers](https://www.databricks.com/solutions/industries/telco-industry-solutions)\n\n**S O L U T I O N**\nCustomer Retention, Subscriber Churn\nPrediction, Threat Detection\n\n**P L AT F O R M**\nLakehouse, Data Science, Machine Learning,\n[Data Streaming](https://www.databricks.com/product/data-streaming)\n\n**C LO U D**\n[Azure](https://www.databricks.com/product/azure)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hadoop technology adds operational complexity and**\n**unnecessary costs**\n\nAT&T is a technology giant with hundreds of millions of subscribers and ingests\n10+ petabytes[ [a](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/04/11/data-att-modernization-lakehouse.html) ] of data across the entire data platform each day. To harness\nthis data, it has a team of 2,500+ data users across 60+ business units to ensure\nthe business is data powered ‚Äî from building analytics to ensure decisions are\nbased on the best data-driven situation awareness to building ML models that\nbring new innovations to its customers. To support these requirements, AT&T\nneeded to democratize and establish a data single version of truth (SVOT) while\nsimplifying infrastructure management to increase agility and lower overall costs.\n\nHowever, physical infrastructure was too resource intensive. The combination\nof a highly complex hardware setup (12,500 data sources and 1,500+ servers)\ncoupled with an on-premises Hadoop architecture proved complex to\nmaintain and expensive to manage. Not only were the operational costs to\nsupport workloads high, but there were also additional capital costs around\ndata centers, licensing and more. Up to 70% of the on-prem platform had to\n\nbe prioritized to ensure 50K data pipeline jobs succeeded and met SLAs and\n\ndata quality objectives. Engineers‚Äô time was focused on managing updates,\n\n\nWith these deeply rooted technology issues, AT&T was not in the best position\nto achieve its goals of increasing its use of insights for improving its customer\nexperience and operating more efficiently. ‚ÄúTo truly democratize data across\nthe business, we needed to pivot to a cloud-native technology environment,‚Äù\nsaid Mark Holcomb, Distinguished Solution Architect at AT&T. ‚ÄúThis has freed\nup resources that had been focused on managing our infrastructure and move\nthem up the value chain, as well as freeing up capital for investing in growthoriented initiatives.‚Äù\n\n**A seamless migration journey to Databricks**\n\nAs part of its due diligence, AT&T ran a comprehensive cost analysis and\nconcluded that Databricks was both the fastest and achieved the best price/\nperformance for data pipelines and machine learning workloads. AT&T knew the\nmigration would be a massive undertaking. As such, the team did a lot of upfront\nplanning ‚Äî they prioritized migrating their largest workloads first to immediately\nreduce their infrastructure footprint. They also decided to migrate their data\nbefore migrating users to ensure a smooth transition and experience for their\nthousands of data practitioners.\n\n\nfixing performance issues or simply provisioning resources rather than focusing\n\n\non higher-valued tasks. The resource constraints of physical infrastructure\n\nalso drove serialization of data science activities, slowing innovation. Another\n\nhurdle faced in operationalizing petabytes of data was the challenge of building\n\nstreaming data pipelines for real-time analytics, an area that was key to\n\nsupporting innovative use cases required to better serve its customers.\n\n\n**The migration from Hadoop to Databricks enables us to bring**\n**more value to our customers and do it more cost-efficiently**\n**and much faster than before.**\n\n**Mark Holcomb**\nDistinguished Solution Architect, AT&T\n\n\n-----\n\nThey spent a year deduplicating and synchronizing data to the cloud before\nmigrating any users. This was a critical step in ensuring the successful migration\nof such a large, complex multi-tenant environment of 2,500+ users from 60+\nbusiness units and their workloads. The user migration process occurred over\nnine months and enabled AT&T to retire on-premises hardware in parallel with\nmigration to accelerate savings as early as possible. Plus, due to the horizontal,\nscalable nature of Databricks, AT&T didn‚Äôt need to have everything in one\ncontiguous environment. Separating data and compute, and across multiple\naccounts and workspaces, ensured analytics worked seamlessly without any API\ncall limits or bandwidth issues and consumption clearly attributed to the 60+\nbusiness units.\n\nAll in all, AT&T migrated over 1,500 servers, more than 50,000 production CPUs,\n12,500 data sources and 300 schemas. The entire process took about two and a\nhalf years. And it was able to manage the entire migration with the equivalent of\n15 full-time internal resources. ‚ÄúDatabricks was a valuable collaborator throughout\nthe process,‚Äù said Holcomb. ‚ÄúThe team worked closely with us to resolve product\nfeatures and security concerns to support our migration timeline.‚Äù\n\n**Databricks reduces TCO and opens new paths to**\n**innovation**\n\nOne of the immediate benefits of moving to Databricks was huge cost savings.\nAT&T was able to rationalize about 30% of its data by identifying and not\nmigrating underutilized and duplicate data. And prioritizing the migration of\nthe largest workloads allowed half the on-prem equipment to be rationalized\n\n\nduring the course of the migration. ‚ÄúBy prioritizing the migration of our most\ncompute-intensive workloads to Databricks, we were able to significantly drive\ndown costs while putting us in position to scale more efficiently moving forward,‚Äù\nexplained Holcomb. The result is an anticipated 300% five-year migration ROI\nfrom OpEx savings and cost avoidance (e.g., not needing to refresh data center\nhardware).\n\nWith data readily available and the means to analyze data at any scale, teams\nof citizen data scientists and analysts can now spend more time innovating,\ninstead of serializing analytics efforts or waiting on engineering to provide the\nnecessary resources ‚Äî or having data scientists spend their valuable time\non less complex or less insightful analyses. Data scientists are now able to\ncollaborate more effectively and speed up machine learning workflows so that\nteams can deliver value more quickly, with a 3x faster time to delivery for new\ndata science use cases.\n\n‚ÄúHistorically you would have had operations in one system and analytics in a\nseparate one,‚Äù said Holcomb. ‚ÄúNow we can do more use cases like operational\nanalytics in a platform that fosters cross-team collaboration, reduces cost and\nimproves the consistency of answers.‚Äù Since migrating to Databricks, AT&T now\nhas a single version of truth to create new data-driven opportunities, including\na self-serve AI-as-a-Service analytics platform that will enable new revenue\nstreams and help it continue delivering exceptional innovations to its millions\nof customers.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### About Databricks\n\nDatabricks is the data and AI company.

The journey began with the simple cash register about 150 years ago, progressed to\nstandardized product reporting with the introduction of the UPC and EAN, and has evolved to include\ncutting-edge technologies such as RFID and machine learning.\n\nToday, we stand on the brink of ‚ÄúGeneration AI,‚Äù defined by sophisticated language models and\nimages. Retailers, with their history of embracing data technologies, find themselves in a strong\nposition to reap the benefits of this new era. Automation of customer service, supply chain modeling\nwith digital twins and delivering hyper-personalized experiences in real time are all in the cards,\npromising to bolster revenue, improve margins and slash costs for early adopters.\n\nAccording to an internal analysis by Databricks, data pioneers are already outstripping their\ncompetition. The ‚ÄúDatabricks 30‚Äù ‚Äî an index tracking the publicly traded data and AI leaders across\nsix major industry sectors, including retail ‚Äî shows these front-runners outperforming the rest of the\nmarket by an impressive and increasing margin. It‚Äôs clear: retailers integrating data and AI strategies\nare setting themselves up for significant gains and a robust competitive advantage.\n\nHowever, for retailers mired in the landscape of outdated data platforms, the transformation into an\nAI-driven organization can seem a Herculean task. Embracing this wave of innovative technologies may\nfeel overwhelming, yet it‚Äôs clear that those who make the leap stand to gain significantly in the rapidly\nevolving retail landscape.\n\nTo help you navigate the rapidly evolving world of retail and consumer goods, this eBook provides a\nroad map for organizations embarking on digital transformation journeys ‚Äî a shift that is as much\nabout culture as it is about technology, if not more so. The core advice? Start with a crystal-clear\nvision for transformation, outlining a compelling case for why such change is vital for the company‚Äôs\nlong-term survival. Then, initiate the process by introducing AI to make gradual enhancements in\ncritical business procedures.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The State of the Retail Industry: The Diverging Performance of Data Leaders vs. Data Laggards\n\n\nThe pandemic‚Äôs fallout has led to a widening chasm between the retail industry‚Äôs\nleaders and laggards. McKinsey & Company encapsulated this trend succinctly:\n‚ÄúCompanies with tech-forward business models, who were already pulling ahead\npre-crisis, left their competitors in the dust.‚Äù\n\nBut what exactly is a ‚Äútech-forward business model‚Äù? It isn‚Äôt a simple narrative of\ndigital natives dethroning traditional retailers. Heavyweights like Walmart, Target\nand Costco held their own against Amazon. Nor was it purely a matter of scale ‚Äî\nsmaller brands like Warby Parker or Everlane managed to carve out substantial\nconsumer bases, competing against larger, established players.\n\n**The common denominator among all victors**\n**was their ability to harness data, analytics and AI**\n**to rapidly react to shifts in consumer behavior.**\n\n\nmethods, optimizing operations to alleviate the pressure these modes exerted\non margins. They successfully established tighter partnerships with suppliers\nand logistic entities, collaborating toward shared triumphs.\n\nIn all these instances, it was their timely access to information, foresight\ndriven by this data, and the exploration of probable outcomes that set these\norganizations apart. Infusing data-driven decision-making into core processes\nwithin the organization, as well as those crossing partner boundaries, unlocked\nthis approach‚Äôs full potential.\n\nTo illustrate the significance of prioritizing data and AI, we developed the\nDatabricks 30 Index. Drawing inspiration from Morgan Stanley‚Äôs ‚ÄúData Era‚Äù\nstocks research, this index tracks marquee customers across our top five\nverticals and partners. The Databricks 30 is an equal-weight price index,\n\ncomposed of five marquee customers each across Retail/Consumer Products,\nFinancial Services, Healthcare, Media/Entertainment, Manufacturing/Logistics,\nplus five strategic partners.\n\n\nThese businesses deftly used consumer demand insights to understand the\neffects of supply chain disruptions and labor shortages and reallocate resources\nto mitigate the most harmful impacts. They adeptly introduced new delivery\n\n\n-----\n\nOur analysis reveals that companies in the Databricks 30 Index outpaced the\nS&P 500 by an impressive +21 percentage points (pp) over the past three years.\nIn other words, if the stock market rose by 50% during this period, the Databricks\n30 Index would have soared by 71% (outperforming by 21pp). Even more\nremarkable, excluding tech entirely from the Databricks 30, the Databricks 30\nex-Tech index outperforms the S&P 500 by an even larger margin over the same\ntime frame: +23pp.\n\n\nDB30 DOw30\n\n\nSimilar to Morgan Stanley‚Äôs analysis, we find that non-tech U.S. companies that\nare investing in cloud, data and innovation do, in fact, win.\n\n\nSo now that we see the impact, let‚Äôs dive into the steps retail organizations can\ntake to put themselves on a trajectory of continued growth and success amid an\never-changing landscape.\n\n\n01-01-2019 01-01-2020 01-01-2021 01-01-2022 01-01-2023\n\n\n01-01-2019 01-01-2020 01-01-2021\n\n\nDATE\n\n\n-----\n\n## Begin With a Shared  Vision of Success\n\n\nThe most overlooked activity in becoming an AI-forward retailer is the most\ncrucial. In the rush to secure a position on the AI frontier, many companies\nare leaping before they look, embarking on AI initiatives without a clear\nunderstanding of what they want to achieve. Simply adopting the newest,\nshiniest tech tools isn‚Äôt a silver bullet. Many companies set themselves up for\nfailure by neglecting to clearly define the expected business outcomes at the\nonset of the initiative, a strategic move that can effectively reduce project risk\nand costs and lead to the ultimate success of the program. In fact, in an attempt\nto accelerate results, this cavalier approach can instead spiral into expensive\nmistakes, wasted resources and a decrease in trust for stakeholders from\nunmet expectations. It‚Äôs like setting sail on an open ocean without a destination\nin mind; the journey might provide some interesting detours, but it lacks\ndirection and purpose.\n\nHowever, when organizations take the time to articulate their expected\nbusiness outcomes before deploying AI and data-driven programs, they position\nthemselves to reduce project risk and costs. By aligning AI initiatives with\nspecific business objectives and creating a shared vision with stakeholders,\nthe focus becomes less about the technology itself and more about how it\ncan be used to reach these defined goals.\n\n\nTechnology decisions, too, are improved by having a known target. Without\nclear business outcomes in mind, companies tend to design, develop and\nimplement technologies that _might_ be needed to solve the problem. Aligning\nthe technical road map and activities with business outcomes mitigates the\nrisk of misallocated resources and the potential fallout from the unfulfilled\npromise of AI.\n\nFurthermore, a clear understanding of expected business outcomes allows\nfor efficient project management and cost control. Companies can set key\nperformance indicators (KPIs) tied directly to these outcomes. This not only\nprovides a means to measure progress, but also helps control costs by\nensuring that resources are targeted toward initiatives that deliver value.\n\nIt‚Äôs not just about numbers either; having explicit objectives aids in cultivating\n\nstakeholder buy-in. Clear communication about the purpose and potential\nbenefits of an AI initiative can foster support from executives, employees,\ninvestors and customers alike. This collective backing can further mitigate risk\nand cut costs by ensuring that everyone is pulling in the same direction.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Why Companies Struggle With  Setting Clear Business Outcomes for AI\n\n\nGetting started with AI at your organization might be daunting, and that‚Äôs\nbecause it is a big undertaking! Struggling to define clear outcomes for AI\nprojects is a common issue among many businesses for a variety of reasons.\nHere are some key factors that contribute to this challenge:\n\n**They believe the data strategy is a technology problem.**\n\nCompanies often hire a chief data officer, or make the data strategy\nthe responsibility of the technology organization.\n\n**They lack an understanding of their business processes**\nAn alarming number of businesses jump onto the AI bandwagon without\nunderstanding how their business operates. Decisions are made at\nthe leadership level, but how they translate to operational decisions is\nmuddled. Data and AI are fundamentally business process technologies,\n\nand without fully understanding how the business works, any initiative\nin data and AI is bound to have limited success.\n\n\n**They lack a data culture**\n\nSomewhat related to the previous point, many companies have teams\nthat make decisions based on experience and intuition. These should\nnot be discounted, but the reason for intuition is often a result of a\npoor definition of processes, which prevents the ability to measure\nand improve processes.\n\n**They struggle to get high-quality data**\n\nAI projects require good-quality, relevant data. Many businesses\nstruggle with issues related to data access, quality, privacy and\nsecurity, which can complicate the process of defining clear outcomes.\n\n**They lack the organizational structures required**\n\nImplementing AI often requires significant changes in business\n\nprocesses, organizational structures and even corporate culture.\nMany companies find it hard to manage these changes, leading to\ndifficulties in setting and achieving clear outcomes.\n\n\n-----\n\nData and AI programs are a business process problem first, and a\ntechnology problem last. Familiarity with technology is important, but\nirrelevant if companies do not understand it.\n\nAddressing these challenges often requires companies to invest in\neducation about AI capabilities, to formulate clear strategies, to manage\nchange effectively, and to bring on board the necessary skills either\nby hiring new talent or upskilling existing employees. It‚Äôs a journey that\nrequires commitment, but the potential benefits of successful AI initiatives\nmake it a worthwhile venture.\n\n\n**They don‚Äôt have the right people in place**\n\nThere‚Äôs often a gap between the skills available within a company and\nthe skills needed to define and achieve AI outcomes. Without team\nmembers who understand AI, data analysis and project management,\nbusinesses can struggle to set clear objectives for AI initiatives.\n\n**They struggle to quantify the value of AI projects**\n\nAI‚Äôs benefits can sometimes be intangible or long-term, making them\ndifficult to quantify. Companies may struggle to define outcomes in\nmeasurable terms, complicating the process of setting objectives\nand monitoring progress.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Before Diving In:  Assess Your Readiness\n\n\nThere is a growing sense of urgency for organizations relatively new to data\nand AI-driven enablement to ‚Äúget in the game.‚Äù Profiles of top performers and\nheadline-making achievements create a clearer sense of what is possible\nand what can be gained, leaving those entering into the space eager to achieve\nsimilar results.\n\nBut what‚Äôs missing in those articles are the sustained investments in\nprocess, people and technology and the numerous challenges, missteps and\noutright failures that had to occur before success was achieved. Data-driven\ntransformation is a journey, and before any successful journey is pursued,\nit‚Äôs wise to reflect on the organization‚Äôs readiness so that you can anticipate\nchallenges and identify areas for remediation and improvement that will\ndeliver you to your intended destination.\n\nWith this in mind, we encourage organizations new to this space to\nassess their maturity in terms of the use and management of their existing\ninformation assets:\n\n1. How easily discoverable and accessible are data in\nyour environment?\n\n\n3. Is the quality of these data formally verified?\n\n4. Are key entities such as products and customers actively\nmanaged, and can data related to these items be easily linked\nacross various data sources?\n\n5. How quickly are data made available for analysis following their\ncreation or modification? Is this latency aligned with how you\nmight use this data?\n\n6. Are processes established for determining appropriate uses of\ndata, governing access and providing oversight on consumption?\n\n7. Is there one individual responsible for effective data management\nacross the enterprise, and has this person established a\n\nprocess for receiving and responding to feedback and shifting\norganizational priorities?\n\nThis list of questions is by no means exhaustive, but it should help to identify\nblockers that are likely to become impediments down the road.\n\n\n2. How well understood are these information assets?\n\n\n-----\n\nSimilarly, we would encourage organizations to assess their maturity in terms of\nanalytics capabilities:\n\n1. Is business performance at all levels assessed in terms of\nkey metrics?\n\n2. How frequently are data-driven analyses used in making key\nbusiness decisions?\n\n3. To what degree are advanced analytics techniques\n‚Äî i.e., data science ‚Äî used in decision-making processes?\n\n4. Are predictive models regularly leveraged as part of operational\nbusiness processes?\n\n5. How is experimentation used to assess the performance of\nvarious initiatives?\n\n\nLastly, and probably most importantly, we‚Äôd encourage the organization to\nperform a frank assessment of its readiness to embrace change. Becoming a\ndata-driven enterprise is fundamentally about operating differently than before.\nDecision-making authority becomes more diffuse and often more automated.\nProject outcomes become less certain as the organization focuses on innovation\nwhere learning is emphasized over predictable results. Process silos often\nbecome more intertwined as new modes of engagement evolve.\n\nWhen done right, this transition creates a healthy tension between what‚Äôs\nneeded to be successful today and what‚Äôs needed to be successful tomorrow.\nBut this can also manifest itself as employee resistance and political infighting\nas processes and organizational structures evolve. What‚Äôs often needed to\novercome this is strong leadership, a clear vision and mandate for change as\nwell as a reassessment of incentive structures and active organizational change\nmanagement as the organization transitions into this new way of working.\n\n\n6. Are predictive models used to automate key business decisions?\n\n\n7. Has the organization embraced a model of continuous deployment\nfor the regular update of model-driven processes?\n\n\n**TRADITIONAL APPROACH**\n\n**Upfront reqs** **Technical implementation** **Production**\n\n\n**ITERATIVE APPROACH**\n\n\nContinuous feedback\n\n\n**Business questions** **Testing** **Production** **Optimization**\n\nContinuous learning and optimization\n\nAn iterative approach involves the use of data to continually optimize the performance of data products.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Getting Started: Putting Some  Wins on the Board\n\n\nWith the organization ready to proceed, the next phase is about learning to\ndeliver new solutions within your organization. There will be new technologies\nto deploy and new skills to develop, and there will be new patterns for\nintegration into business workflows and procedures for incremental updates\nand improvements. But most importantly, there will need to be a new level of\npartnership and trust between the business and the technology sides of the\norganization that needs to be carefully nurtured.\n\nThe best way we have found to do this is to start with projects that improve\non existing operational workflows, i.e., do what you do, but do it smarter.\nThe business is often familiar with existing pain points and can more clearly\nenvision how a new capability can be folded into its processes. They are also\nfamiliar with how to assess the impact a new approach may have on their\nbusiness and can help design tests to validate whether the intended results\n\n\nAs capabilities demonstrating value over the status quo are developed, they\nare folded into business processes. This is not a one-and-done effort but part\nof an ongoing cycle of deployment to continue so long as the team has a line\nof sight to meaningful gains. The team does not wait for the ideal solution but\ninstead focuses on incremental improvements that deliver measurable value\nalong the way.\n\nOversight for this process is provided by another body, one tasked with the\nsuccess of the overall transformative efforts within the business. As success\nis delivered, there will be growing demand for the time and talents of these\nteams, and the organization will need to prioritize resources across an increasing\nnumber of opportunities. This steering committee will need to be responsible for\nallocating limited resources and advocating for additional ones as well to strike\nthe right balance of investments for the organization.\n\n\nare or are not being delivered.\n\n\n**DEMAND FORECASTING**\n\nDemand forecasting is a massive challenge for retail and consumer goods\n\norganizations. And one where even an incremental change can have a massive impact,\n\nso it‚Äôs often one of the first projects organizations identify to put a win on the board.\n\nAccording to [McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/notes-from-the-ai-frontier-applications-and-value-of-deep-learning) , a 10% to 20% improvement in supply chain forecasting\n\naccuracy is likely to produce a 5% reduction in inventory costs and a 2% to 3%\n\nincrease in revenues. To hit the ground running, check out the [Databricks Solution](https://www.databricks.com/solutions/accelerators/demand-forecasting)\n\n[Accelerators for Demand Forecasting](https://www.databricks.com/solutions/accelerators/demand-forecasting) ‚Äî pre-built notebooks and best practices for\n\nkey use cases.\n\n\nWork on these projects is a collaborative effort between the business and IT.\nTogether, the project team explores a potential solution with a notion of how it\nmay be integrated in mind from the outset. As the project unfolds, all members\nare part of the iterative cycles and help to steer the solution in new directions\nuntil an item of value is derived.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Going Big: Learning to Embrace  Transformational Change\n\n\nWith some experience under your belt, it‚Äôs time to build on the organizational\nmuscle developed during initial efforts and flex for more transformative impact.\nAgain, the focus is on established functions within the business, but instead of\npointed, incremental improvements, the team begins to create a vision for the\npart of the organization that would operate if it were to fully embrace data and\nAI enablement.\n\nIt‚Äôs at this phase that many of the concerns about organizational resistance\nmentioned earlier are most likely to manifest themselves. Ideally, initial\nimplementation efforts have built champions within the business, but it‚Äôs still\nimportant to be mindful of pushback that can emerge as the organization more\nfully begins to change. Having and maintaining strong business sponsorship\nin this phase is critical, and having that sponsor articulate and regularly\nreinforce a clear vision for the change that‚Äôs now underway can help everyone\n\nunderstand the need to support these efforts.\n\n\nSo far in this exploration of the journey to data and AI transformation, we‚Äôve\nminimized the importance of technology in order to focus on the business and\norganizational aspects that often get neglected in this conversation. But it‚Äôs\nat this stage that the organization needs to have established its preference\nfor data and analytics platforms. Because of the breadth of needs that will\nhave to be addressed and the ongoing innovation taking place in the data\nscience community, we strongly suggest standardizing on a platform that is\nopen and flexible while also providing cost-effective use of both infrastructure\nand people resources and strong data governance and protection. For many\norganizations, the Databricks Lakehouse Platform has proven itself to be the\nideal platform to meet these needs.\n\n**WHY STANDARDIZE ON DATABRICKS?**\n\nThe Databricks Lakehouse is the only enterprise data and AI\n\nplatform that allows retailers to leverage all of their data, from any\n\nsource, on any workload to always offer more engaging customer\n\nexperiences driven by real-time data, at the lowest cost and with\n\nthe greatest investment protection.\n\n\n-----\n\nBut simply standardizing on a platform is not enough. The organization\nneeds to work through the roles and responsibilities around the use of this\nplatform and processes for moving things from experimentation and formal\ndevelopment to testing and operationalization.\n\nThe importance of having an MLOps strategy really comes to life at this\nphase. This doesn‚Äôt mean your strategy around MLOps can‚Äôt change, but this\nphase is when you want to think about and define your answers to some key\nquestions such as the following:\n\n1. How do we evaluate new and existing (retrained) models as\npart of their movement from development to production?\n\n2. How do we determine when a model should be retrained?\n\n3. What are the preferred mechanisms for production deployment?\n\n4. How do we fall back should we have a deployment problem?\n\n5. What are the service level expectations for the\ndeployment processes?\n\n\n###### ‚ÄùDatabricks Lakehouse has simplified the adoption of AI so that we can deliver better shopping experiences for our customers.‚Äù\n\n**Numan Ali**\n\nSolutions Architect, Data and Analytics Center of Excellence at Pandora\n\n\n-----\n\n## Normalizing the Process: Engraining a Data-Driven Mindset Into the Fabric of the Business\n\n\nToo often, leadership views innovation as a destination and not a process\n(‚ÄúLet‚Äôs launch an LLM app!‚Äù). An enterprise doesn‚Äôt simply transform into a\ndata-driven organization overnight and then it‚Äôs done. Yes, there will be an\nupfront investment, but there will also be ongoing investment in order to\nsupport sustained innovation.\n\nIronically, one of the major obstacles to this change is viewing the goal as\nsimply delivering a project or projects. Think about it ‚Äî just 12 months ago,\nonly a few specialists in academia and industry were talking about generative\nAI and large language models (LLMs). Today, [retailers have to integrate this](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/04/13/retail-age-generative-ai.html)\n[new technology](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/04/13/retail-age-generative-ai.html) or fall behind others who will find a way to create more\npersonalized consumer experiences with it.\n\n\nTechnology, especially when it comes to data and AI, moves far too quickly.\nWhat retailer tech teams need to deliver at the end of the day is applications,\nof course, but also the ability to react quickly to change. What sort of ongoing\ninvestments in terms of people, process and technology do retailers need to\nfoster in order to ingrain an innovation mindset?\n\nThis is an ongoing balancing act where organizations need to innovate and look\nfor new opportunities but also sustain that innovation in a way that is realistic\nfor the business. For this, let‚Äôs consider the 70-20-10 rule: the idea that\ncompanies should allocate 70% of innovation investment to core initiatives,\n20% to adjacent ones and 10% to transformational ones, or ‚Äúmoonshots.‚Äù While\nnot a hard-and-fast rule, this concept was touted by Google co-founder Larry\nPage in a [Fortune magazine article](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://money.cnn.com/2008/04/29/magazines/fortune/larry_page_change_the_world.fortune/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1690998645852122&usg=AOvVaw2AHj-fx8XkEeMKP2Ts5gDu) , and was validated by a [study conducted](https://hbr.org/2012/05/managing-your-innovation-portfolio)\n[by Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2012/05/managing-your-innovation-portfolio) , which found that companies following the rule\n\noutperformed their peers, typically realizing a P/E premium of 10% to 20%.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe goal of the 70-20-10 rule is to help guide the organization toward\nsustained innovation and spend the bulk of time on the core business. This is\npart of why we recommend starting first with fast (just 2- to 3-month total)\npilot projects to use AI on existing business use cases like demand forecasting\nand call center optimization. By working in these areas with a focus on learning\nand iterating, retailers will soon find where data silos and rigidity exist in the\nsystem. As these foundational barriers are knocked down, it then makes it\npossible to tackle more transformational use cases and start to build the\ncharacteristics of a data-forward enterprise. In other words, start to utilize\ndata and data-driven insights as a primary driver for decision-making and\noperations, while also prioritizing continuous data analysis and improvement.\n\n\n**TRANSFORMATIVE**\n\n\n**ADJACENT**\n\n\n**CORE**\n\n\n###### Companies that allocated about 70% of their innovation activity to core initiatives, \n### 20% to adjacent ones and 10% to\n###### transformational ones outperformed their peers.\n\n**Bansi Nagji & Geoff Tuff**\n_Managing Your Innovation Portfolio_\nHarvard Business Review, May 2012\n\n\n-----\n\n## From Hindsight to Foresight: The Journey to Becoming a Data-Forward Enterprise\n\n\nSo what does it take to successfully embark on this\njourney to becoming a data-forward enterprise?\nFirst and foremost, you need to not only establish\na baseline understanding of what has occurred by\nexamining historical data but leverage advancements\nin technologies (e.g., streaming, computer vision,\nvoice recognition) to make predictions of the future.\n\nThrough the use of both historical data and\npredictive techniques such as forecasting,\nrecommendations, prescriptive care and nextbest-action, organizations can begin to improve\ndecisions and, in some cases, automate certain\ndecision-making processes. But rather than moving\n\nfrom historical views to predictive actions in a\nlinear fashion, this journey involves addressing both\napproaches simultaneously. Once you are able to\nunify historical and predictive analysis, you can then\ntake significant steps toward becoming a dataforward enterprise.\n\n\n##### The Data-Forward Enterprise\n\nData, analytics and AI working in concert\n\n\n**Data Purgatory**\nThings are better, but data isn‚Äôt\ndriving the business\n\n\n**Data Maturity**\nEvery aspect of the\nbusiness is supported\nby insights and AI\n\n\n**Data Siloed**\nData and teams are segregated\ninto different systems\n\nDATA MATURITY\n\nBeing data-forward means silos cease to exist, and data, analytics and AI are informing every aspect of the business.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The 8 Steps to Building a  Data-Forward Retailer\n\n\nBefore you start your data-forward journey, a few critical steps must be\nconsidered to establish a solid foundation to build upon. Based on our\nwork with the largest and most successful retailers in the world, spanning\nstartups to global giants, we at Databricks have seen that the most successful\nfollowed these steps to effectively gain wallet share, whereas those who\ncouldn‚Äôt would often leave major gaps that competitors could take advantage\nof. These steps are the basics to prepare businesses for where they need\nto be both now and in the near future.\n\n\n**2** **Get grounded: Understand the technology**\n\nTo start, business leaders need to ground themselves in technology, especially\nwhen it comes to AI. AI can do amazing things, but it is not magical and vendors\nare prone to overpromising and underdelivering. Less than getting deep into\ncode, the purpose is to understand the limitations and ideal use cases.\n\nDatabricks provides several [free resources for retailers](https://www.databricks.com/explore/retail-resources) , but we recommend\nstarting with [The Big Book of Retail & Consumer Goods Use Cases](https://www.databricks.com/resources/ebook/big-book-of-retail-consumer-goods-use-cases) for a C-level\nperspective of how different brands are using data, analytics and AI to drive\nrevenue or cut operational costs.\n\n\n**1** **Set the foundation: Define goals and objectives**\n\n\nThe best way to avoid shiny object syndrome (where you start out with a\n\ntechnology and then try to figure out what to do with it) is to first identify the\nproblems you want to solve. From there, you can set goals around innovation\nto align incentives, and, most importantly, ensure you are driving specific\nbusiness outcomes such as improving customer engagement, optimizing\ninventory management or increasing sales.\n\n\n**3** **Understand the skills and processes in your business**\n\nAs we will get into in step 4, starting with smaller pilot projects enables you\nto not just deliver a quick win and validate the use of AI in the enterprise, but\nalso understand the in-house capabilities in terms of people, process and\ntechnology to deliver technical projects. And if required, be willing and ready\nto hire people with the right skill sets that can help you make the most of your\ndata. For example, building a core team of data analysts can help extract deep\ninsights that lead to better decision-making and identify opportunities for\ngrowth. It is critical at this step to define the roles you need, determine how\nyou will source for those roles (via external hiring or internal transfer), and\nensure those roles have opportunities for career progression.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor inspiration and a head start, check out our [Solution Accelerators for Retail](https://www.databricks.com/solutions/accelerators?industry=Retail%20and%20Consumer%20Goods)\n[& Consumer Goods](https://www.databricks.com/solutions/accelerators?industry=Retail%20and%20Consumer%20Goods) .

This data can (and should) come from a variety of sources,\nso it‚Äôs key to unify all data types and sources (sales transactions, customer\nfeedback, social media) in a centralized location that is easily accessible,\nwhile not losing sight of data security to maintain customer trust. Setting\nup data governance parameters to control who has which kinds of access\nto what data, and being able to audit the history of this access, will actually\naccelerate innovation while ensuring data security and compliance.\n\n\n**Delivering exactly what customers want,**\n**every time, and on time**\n\nData is at the heart of Gousto‚Äôs mission to change the\nway people eat through the delivery of boxes of fresh\ningredients and easy-to-follow recipes.

When selecting a pilot project, we recommend starting with\na project that will deliver clear business value, such as incremental revenue\nor clear cost savings, yet only takes 2-3 months to complete. The more time\nthere is between project inception and seeing results, the more likely it will lose\nmomentum internally.\n\n\n-----\n\n**6** **Incorporate AI across the business (starting with daily tasks)**\n\nGiven the large upfront investment in data scientists and engineers to build\nan AI program, the ROI will come from using it at scale.

In\npractice, it means empowering all employees to use data to inform their\ndecisions. Only some strategic decisions will be based on complete and\naccurate information. It‚Äôs unwise to assume otherwise. The right approach\nis to leverage as much data as possible, from past tests or current efforts,\nto mitigate risk.

You can always personalize more, forecast better, or\nbetter manage your supply chain as you bring in better data sources and refine\nyour models.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Transform Retail Data  Into Actionable Insights\n\n\nBecoming data forward is not a crazy idea. Too often, leaders or organizations\nallow themselves to be intimidated by focusing on large-scale transformations.\nBut it‚Äôs the small operational changes that can make your business more efficient\nas well as shift the larger culture forward. Once you‚Äôve set this foundation, it then\nallows you to move toward bigger things. These steps may fail, but it‚Äôs actually\npositive to have these setbacks to learn from to try again. The bigger risk is to\nnot try and thus fall behind competitors who are embracing the internal changes\nneeded to take advantage of AI and machine learning.\n\nCore to delivering on these steps to become a data-forward retailer is a solid\ndata foundation that can unify your data and AI workloads with sharing and\ngovernance built in, so internal and external teams can get access to the\ndata they need when they need it.

We also note that no single\n\narchitecture or prescription will work for all\n\norganizations or use cases. Therefore, while we\n\nprovide guidelines for building MLOps, we call out\n\nimportant options and variations. This whitepaper\n\nis written primarily for ML engineers and data\n\nscientists wanting to learn more about MLOps,\n\nwith high-level guidance and pointers to more\n\nresources.\n\n\nThe past decade has seen rapid growth in the adoption of machine learning (ML). While the early\n\nadopters were a small number of large technology companies that could afford the necessary resources,\n\nin recent times ML-driven business cases have become ubiquitous in all industries. Indeed, according to\n\nMIT Sloan Management Review, 83% of CEOs report that [artificial intelligence (AI) is a strategic priority](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/artificial-intelligence-in-business-gets-real/) .\n\nThis democratization of ML across industries has brought huge economic benefits, with [Gartner estimating](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2018-04-25-gartner-says-global-artificial-intelligence-business-value-to-reach-1-point-2-trillion-in-2018)\n\n[that $3.9T in business value](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2018-04-25-gartner-says-global-artificial-intelligence-business-value-to-reach-1-point-2-trillion-in-2018) will be created by AI in 2022.\n\nHowever, building and deploying ML models is complex. There are many options available for achieving\n\nthis but little in the way of well-defined and accessible standards. As a result, over the past few years we\n\nhave seen the emergence of the machine learning operations (MLOps) field. **MLOps is a set of processes**\n\n**and automation for managing models, data and code to improve performance stability and long-term**\n\n**efficiency in ML systems.** Put simply, MLOps = [ModelOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ModelOps) + [DataOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DataOps) + [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) .\n\nThe concept of developer operations (DevOps) is nothing new. It has been used for decades to deploy\n\nsoftware applications, and the deployment of ML applications has much to gain from it. However, strong\n\nDevOps practices and tooling alone are insufficient because ML applications rely on a constellation of\n\nartifacts (e.g., models, data, code) that require special treatment. Any MLOps solution must take into\n\naccount the various people and processes that interact with these artifacts.\n\nHere at Databricks we have seen firsthand how customers develop their MLOps approaches, some of\n\nwhich work better than others. We launched the open source [MLflow](https://www.mlflow.org/) project to help make our customers\n\nsuccessful with MLOps, and with over 10 million downloads/month from PyPI as of May 2022, MLflow‚Äôs\n\nadoption is a testament to the appetite for operationalizing ML models.\n\nThis whitepaper aims to explain how your organization can build robust MLOps practices incrementally.\n\nFirst, we describe the people and process involved in deploying ML applications and the need for\n\noperational rigor. We also provide general principles to help guide your planning and decision-making. Next,\n\nwe go through the fundamentals of MLOps, defining terms and broad strategies for deployment. Finally, we\n\nintroduce a general MLOps reference architecture, the details of its processes, and best practices.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### People and process\n\n**M L W O R K F L O W A N D P E R S O N A S**\n\nData Governance Officer\n\nDat1\nData Scientist\nEngineer\n\nML Engineer\n\nBusiness Stakeholder\n\n\nDataa\nPreparation\n\n\nEvplorator{a\nData unal{sis\n\n\nFeature ModeÔøΩ Modela Deplo{ÔøΩent\nEngineering Training Validation\n\n\nModeÔøΩ Modela Deplo{ÔøΩent Monitoring\nTraining Validation\n\n\nModela\nValidation\n\n\n**Figure 1**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### People\n\nBuilding ML applications is a team sport, and while in the real world people ‚Äúwear many hats,‚Äù it is still\n\nuseful to think in terms of archetypes. They help us understand roles and responsibilities and where\n\nhandoffs are required, and they highlight areas of complexity within the system. We distinguish between\n\nthe following personas:\n\n**M L P E R S O N A S**\n\n\nData\nGovernance\nOfficer\n\nResponsible for ensuring\n\nthat data governance,\n\ndata privacy and other\n\ncompliance measures are\n\nadhered to across the\n\nmodel development and\n\ndeployment process. Not\n\ntypically involved in day-to-\n\nday operations.\n\n\nData\nEngineer\n\nResponsible for building\n\ndata pipelines to process,\n\norganize and persist data\n\nsets for machine learning\n\nand other downstream\n\napplications.\n\n\nData\nScientist\n\nResponsible for\n\nunderstanding the business\n\nproblem, exploring available\n\ndata to understand\n\nif machine learning is\n\napplicable, and then training,\n\ntuning and evaluating a\n\nmodel to be deployed.\n\n\nML\nEngineer\n\nResponsible for deploying\n\nmachine learning models to\n\nproduction with appropriate\n\ngovernance, monitoring and\n\nsoftware development best\n\npractices such as continuous\n\nintegration and continuous\n\ndeployment ( [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) ).\n\n\nBusiness\nStakeholder\n\nResponsible for using the\n\nmodel to make decisions for\n\nthe business or product, and\n\nresponsible for the business\n\nvalue that the model is\n\nexpected to generate.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Process\n\nTogether, these people develop and maintain ML applications. While the development process follows\n\na distinct pattern, it is not entirely monolithic. The way you deploy a model has an impact on the steps\n\nyou take, and using techniques like reinforcement learning or online learning will change some details.\n\nNevertheless, these steps and personas involved are variations on a core theme, as illustrated in Figure 1\n\nabove.\n\nLet‚Äôs walk through the process step by step. Keep in mind that this is an iterative process, the frequency of\n\nwhich will be determined by the particular business case and data.\n\n**M L P R O C E S S**\n\n\nData\nPreparation\n\n\nExploratory\nData Analysis\n\n\nFeature\nEngineering\n\n\nModel\nTraining\n\n\nModel\nValidation\n\n\nDeployment Monitoring\n\n\n###### Data preparation\n\nPrior to any data science or ML work lies the data engineering needed to prepare production data and make\n\nit available for consumption. This data may be referred to as ‚Äúraw data,‚Äù and in later steps, data scientists\n\nwill extract features and labels from the raw data.\n\n###### Exploratory data analysis (EDA)\n\nAnalysis is conducted by data scientists to assess statistical properties of the data available, and determine\n\nif they address the business question. This requires frequent communication and iteration with business\n\nstakeholders.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Feature engineering\n\nData scientists clean data and apply business logic and specialized transformations to engineer features for\n\nmodel training. These data, or features, are split into training, testing and validation sets.\n\n###### Model training\n\nData scientists explore multiple algorithms and hyperparameter configurations using the prepared data, and\n\na best-performing model is determined according to predefined evaluation metric(s).\n\n###### Model validation\n\nPrior to deployment a selected model is subjected to a validation step to ensure that it exceeds\n\nsome baseline level of performance, in addition to meeting any other technical, business or regulatory\n\nrequirements. This necessitates collaboration between data scientists, business stakeholders and ML\n\nengineers.\n\n###### Deployment\n\nML engineers will deploy a validated model via batch, streaming or online serving, depending on the\n\nrequirements of the use case.\n\n###### Monitoring\n\nML engineers will monitor deployed models for signs of performance degradation or errors. Data scientists\n\nwill often be involved in early monitoring phases to ensure that new models perform as expected after\n\ndeployment. This will inform if and when the deployed model should be updated by returning to earlier\n\nstages in the workflow.\n\nThe data governance officer is ultimately responsible for making sure this entire process is compliant with\n\ncompany and regulatory policies.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Why should I care about MLOps?\n\nConsider that the typical ML application depends on the aforementioned people and process, as well\n\nas regulatory and ethical requirements. These dependencies change over time ‚Äî and your models, data\n\nand code must change as well. The data that were a reliable signal yesterday become noise; open source\n\nlibraries become outdated; regulatory environments evolve; and teams change. ML systems must be\n\nresilient to these changes. Yet this broad scope can be a lot for organizations to manage ‚Äî there are many\n\nmoving parts! Addressing these challenges with a defined MLOps strategy can dramatically reduce the\n\niteration cycle of delivering models to production, thereby accelerating time to business value.\n\nThere are two main types of risk in ML systems: **technical risk** inherent to the system itself and **risk of**\n\n**noncompliance** with external systems. Both of these risks derive from the dependencies described above.\n\nFor example, if data pipeline infrastructure, KPIs, model monitoring and documentation are lacking, then you\n\nrisk your system becoming destabilized or ineffective. On the other hand, even a well-designed system that\n\nfails to comply with corporate, regulatory and ethical requirements runs the risk of losing funding, receiving\n\nfines or incurring reputational damage. Recently, one private company‚Äôs data collection practices were\n\nfound to have violated the Children‚Äôs Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA). The [FTC fined](https://www.protocol.com/policy/ftc-algorithm-destroy-data-privacy) the company\n\n$1.5 million and [ordered](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/wwkurbostipulatedorder.pdf) it to destroy or delete the illegally harvested data, and all models or algorithms\n\ndeveloped with that data.\n\nWith respect to efficiency, the absence of MLOps is typically marked by an overabundance of manual\n\nprocesses. These steps are slower and more prone to error, affecting the quality of models, data and code.\n\nEventually they form a bottleneck, capping the ability for a data team to take on new projects.\n\nSeen through these lenses, the aim of MLOps becomes clear: improve the long-term performance\n\nstability and success rate of ML systems while maximizing the efficiency of teams who build them. In the\n\nintroduction, we defined MLOps to address this aim: MLOps is a **set of processes and automation** to\n\nmanage **models, data and code** to meet the two goals of **stable performance and long-term efficiency in**\n\n**ML systems** . _MLOps = ModelOps + DataOps + DevOps_ .\n\nWith clear goals we are ready to discuss principles that guide design decisions and planning for MLOps\n\n\nM o d e l O p s D a t a O p s D e ÔøΩO p s\n\n\n-----\n\nGiven the complexity of ML\n\nprocesses and the different personas\n\ninvolved, it is helpful to start from\n\nsimpler, high-level guidance. We\n\npropose several broadly applicable\n\nprinciples to guide MLOps decisions.\n\nThey inform our design choices in\n\nlater sections, and we hope they can\n\nbe adapted to support whatever your\n\n\n#### Guiding principles\n\n###### Always keep your business goals in mind\n\nJust as the core purpose of ML in a business is to enable data-driven decisions and products, the core\n\npurpose of MLOps is to ensure that those data-driven applications remain stable, are kept up to date and\n\ncontinue to have positive impacts on the business. When prioritizing technical work on MLOps, consider the\n\nbusiness impact: Does it enable new business use cases? Does it improve data teams‚Äô productivity? Does it\n\nreduce operational costs or risks?\n\n###### Take a data-centric approach to machine learning\n\nFeature engineering, training, inference and monitoring pipelines are data pipelines. As such, they need to be\n\nas robust as other production data engineering processes. Data quality is crucial in any ML application, so\n\nML data pipelines should employ systematic approaches to monitoring and mitigating data quality issues.\n\nAvoid tools that make it difficult to join data from ML predictions, model monitoring, etc., with the rest of\n\nyour data. The simplest way to achieve this is to develop ML applications on the same platform used to\n\nmanage production data. For example, instead of downloading training data to a laptop, where it is hard\n\nto govern and reproduce results, secure the data in cloud storage and make that storage available to your\n\ntraining process.\n\n\nbusiness use case may be.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### \u0007Implement MLOps in a modular fashion\n\nAs with any software application, code quality is paramount for an ML application. Modularized code\n\nenables testing of individual components and mitigates difficulties with future code refactoring. Define\n\nclear steps (e.g., training, evaluation or deployment), supersteps (e.g., training-to-deployment pipeline) and\n\nresponsibilities to clarify the modular structure of your ML application.\n\n###### Process should guide automation\n\nWe automate processes to improve productivity and lower risk of human error, but not every step of a\n\nprocess can or should be automated. People still determine the business question, and some models will\n\nalways need human oversight before deployment. Therefore, the development process is primary and each\n\nmodule in the process should be automated as needed. This allows incremental build-out of automation\n\nand customization. Furthermore, when it comes to particular automation tools, choose those that align to\n\nyour people and process. For example, instead of building a model logging framework around a generic\n\ndatabase, you can choose a specialized tool like MLflow, which has been designed with the ML model\n\nlifecycle in mind.\n\n\n-----\n\n**CHAPTER 2:**\n## Fundamentals of MLOps\n\n**Note:** In our experience with customers, there\n\ncan be variations in these three stages, such as\n\nsplitting staging into separate ‚Äútest‚Äù and ‚ÄúQA‚Äù\n\nsubstages. However, the principles remain the\n\nsame and we stick to a dev, staging and prod\n\nsetup within this paper.\n\n\n#### Semantics of dev, staging and prod\n\nML workflows include the following key assets: code, models and data. These assets need to be developed\n\n(dev), tested (staging) and deployed (prod). For each stage, we also need to operate within an execution\n\nenvironment. Thus, all the above ‚Äî execution environments, code, models and data ‚Äî are divided into dev,\n\nstaging and prod.\n\nThese divisions can best be understood in terms of quality guarantees and access control. On one end,\n\nassets in prod are generally business critical, with the highest guarantee of quality and tightest control on\n\nwho can modify them. Conversely, dev assets are more widely accessible to people but offer no guarantee\n\nof quality.\n\nFor example, many data scientists will work together in a dev environment, freely producing dev model\n\nprototypes. Any flaws in these models are relatively low risk for the business, as they are separate from\n\nthe live product. In contrast, the staging environment replicates the execution environment of production.\n\nHere, code changes made in the dev environment are tested prior to code being deployed to production.\n\nThe staging environment acts as a gateway for code to reach production, and accordingly, fewer people\n\nare given access to staging. Code promoted to production is considered a live product. In the production\n\nenvironment, human error can pose the greatest risk to business continuity, and so the least number of\n\npeople have permission to modify production models.\n\nOne might be tempted to say that code, models and data each share a one-to-one correspondence with\n\nthe execution environment ‚Äî e.g., all dev code, models and data are in the dev environment. That is often\n\nclose to true but is rarely correct. Therefore, we will next discuss the precise semantics of dev, staging\n\nand prod for execution environments, code, models and data. We also discuss mechanisms for restricting\n\naccess to each.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Execution environments\n\nAn execution environment is the place where models and data are created or consumed by code. Each\n\nexecution environment consists of compute instances, their runtimes and libraries, and automated jobs.\n\nWith Databricks, an ‚Äúenvironment‚Äù can be defined via dev/staging/prod separation at a few levels. An\n\norganization could create distinct environments across multiple cloud accounts, multiple Databricks\n\nworkspaces in the same cloud account, or within a single Databricks workspace. These separation patterns\n\nare illustrated in Figure 2 below.\n\n**E N V I R O N M E N T S E P A R AT I O N P AT T E R N S**\n\n\nMultiple clou$\naccounts\n\nstaging\n\nprod\n\n\nMultiple Databricks\nworkspaces\n\nstaging\n\nprod\n\n\nDatabricks workspace\naccess controls\n\n\ndev\n\nstaging\n\nprod\n\n\ndev\n\n\ndev\n\n\n**Figure 2**\n\n\n-----\n\nDatabricks released Delta Lake to the open source\n\ncommunity in 2019. Delta Lake provides all the data\n\n\n###### Code\n\nML project code is often stored in a version control repository (such as Git), with most organizations\n\nusing branches corresponding to the lifecycle phases of development, staging or production. There are a\n\nfew common patterns. Some use only development branches (dev) and one main branch (staging/prod).\n\nOthers use main and development branches (dev), branches cut for testing potential releases (staging), and\n\nbranches cut for final releases (prod). Regardless of which convention you choose, separation is enforced\n\nthrough Git repository branches.\n\n\nlifecycle management functions that are needed\n\n\nto make cloud-based object stores reliable and\n\nperformant. This design allows clients to update\n\nmultiple objects at once and to replace a subset\n\nof the objects with another, etc., in a serializable\n\nmanner that still achieves high parallel read/write\n\nperformance from the objects ‚Äî while offering\n\nadvanced capabilities like time travel (e.g., query\n\n\nAs a best practice, code should only be run in an execution environment that corresponds to it or in one\n\nthat‚Äôs higher. For example, the dev environment can run any code, but the prod environment can only run\n\nprod code.\n\n###### Models\n\nWhile models are usually marked as dev, staging or prod according to their lifecycle phase, **it is important to**\n\n**note that model and code lifecycle phases often operate asynchronously** . That is, you may want to push\n\na new model version before you push a code change, and vice versa. Consider the following scenarios:\n\n\npoint-in-time snapshots or rollback of erroneous\n\n\n\u0007To detect fraudulent transactions, you develop an ML pipeline that retrains a model weekly. Deploying\n\nthe code can be a relatively infrequent process, but each week a new model undergoes its own lifecycle\n\nof being generated, tested and marked as ‚Äúproduction‚Äù to predict on the most recent transactions. In\n\nthis case the code lifecycle is slower than the model lifecycle.\n\n\u0007To classify documents using large deep neural networks, training and deploying the model is often a one-\n\ntime process due to cost. Updates to the serving and monitoring code in the project may be deployed\n\nmore frequently than a new version of the model. In this case the model lifecycle is slower than the code.\n\nSince model lifecycles do not correspond one-to-one with code lifecycles, it makes sense for model\n\nmanagement to have its own service. [MLflow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yCODhUuimWJHR8Sc-sd6xY7vJuN6nPek2pNrfhv7hU4/edit#heading=h.1yd956s4db32) and its Model Registry support managing model artifacts\n\ndirectly via UI and APIs. The loose coupling of model artifacts and code provides flexibility to update\n\nproduction models without code changes, streamlining the deployment process in many cases. Model\n\nartifacts are secured using MLflow access controls or cloud storage permissions\n\n\nupdates), automatic data layout optimization,\n\nupserts, caching and audit logs.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Data\n\nSome organizations label data as either dev, staging or prod, depending on which environment it originated\n\nin. For example, all prod data is produced in the prod environment, but dev and staging environments may\n\nhave read-only access to them. Marking data this way also indicates a guarantee of data quality: dev data\n\nmay be temporary or not meant for wider use, whereas prod data may offer stronger guarantees around\n\n\nreliability and freshness. Access to data in each environment is controlled with table access controls\n\n( [AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/security/access-control/table-acls/index.html) [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/security/access-control/table-acls/) [GCP](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/security/access-control/table-acls/index.html) ) or cloud storage permissions.\n| |\n\nIn summary, when it comes to MLOps, you will always have operational separation between dev, staging and\n\nprod. Assets in dev will have the least restrictive access controls and quality guarantees, while those in prod\n\nwill be the highest quality and tightly controlled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|ASSET|SEMANTICS|SEPARATED BY|\n|---|---|---|\n|Execution environments|Labeled according to where development, testing and connections with production systems happen|Cloud provider and Databricks Workspace access controls|\n|Models|Labeled according to model lifecycle phase|MLflow access controls or cloud storage permissions|\n|Data|Labeled according to its origin in dev, staging or prod execution environments|Table access controls or cloud storage permissions|\n|Code|Labeled according to software development lifecycle phase|Git repository branches|\n\n\n**Table 1**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### ML deployment patterns\n\nThe fact that models and code can be managed separately results in multiple possible patterns for getting\n\nML artifacts through staging and into production. We explain two major patterns below.\n\n**D E P L O Y M O D E L S**\n\ndev staging prod\n\n**D E P L O Y C O D E**\n\ndev staging prod\n\nThese two patterns differ in terms of whether the model artifact or the training code that produces the\n\nmodel artifact is promoted toward production.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Deploy models\n\nIn the first pattern, the model artifact is generated by training code in the development environment.\n\nThis artifact is then tested in staging for compliance and performance before finally being deployed into\n\nproduction. This is a simpler handoff for data scientists, and in cases where model training is prohibitively\n\nexpensive, training the model once and managing that artifact may be preferable. However, this simpler\n\narchitecture comes with limitations. If production data is not accessible from the development environment\n\n(e.g., for security reasons), this architecture may not be viable. This architecture does not naturally support\n\nautomated model retraining. While you could automate retraining in the development environment, you\n\nwould then be treating ‚Äúdev‚Äù training code as production ready, which many deployment teams would not\n\naccept. This option hides the fact that ancillary code for featurization, inference and monitoring needs to be\n\ndeployed to production, requiring a separate code deployment path.\n\n###### Deploy code\n\nIn the second pattern, the code to train models is developed in the dev environment, and this code is\n\nmoved to staging and then production. Models will be trained in each environment: initially in the dev\n\nenvironment as part of model development, in staging (on a limited subset of data) as part of integration\n\ntests, and finally in the production environment (on the full production data) to produce the final model.\n\nIf an organization restricts data scientists‚Äô access to production data from dev or staging environments,\n\ndeploying code allows training on production data while respecting access controls. Since training code\n\ngoes through code review and testing, it is safer to set up automated retraining. Ancillary code follows the\n\nsame pattern as model training code, and both can go through integration tests in staging. However, the\n\nlearning curve for handing code off to collaborators can be steep for many data scientists, so opinionated\n\nproject templates and workflows are helpful. Finally, data scientists need visibility into training results from\n\nthe production environment, for only they have the knowledge to identify and fix ML-specific issues.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe diagram below contrasts the code lifecycle for the above deployment patterns across the different\n\nexecution environments.\n\n\nCode\ndevelopment\n\nDevelopment\nenvironment\n\n\nUnit\ntests\n\n\nIntegration\ntests\n\nDevelopment\nenvironment\n\nStaging\nenvironment\n\n\nModel\ntraining\n\n\nContinuous\ndeployment\n\nStaging\nenvironment\n\nProduction\nenvironment\n\n\nDeploy\npipelines\n\nProduction\nenvironment\n\n\n#### Deploy models\n\n Deploy code\n\n\n**In general we recommend following the ‚Äúdeploy code‚Äù approach, and the reference architecture in**\n\n**this document is aligned to it.** Nevertheless, there is no perfect process that covers every scenario, and\n\nthe options outlined above are not mutually exclusive. Within a single organization, you may find some use\n\ncases deploying training code and others deploying model artifacts. Your choice of process will depend on\n\nthe business use case, resources available and what is most likely to succeed.\n\n\n-----\n\n|Col1|Col2|DEPLOY MODELS|DEPLOY CODE|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Process|Dev|Develop training code.

When appropriate,\n\nwe will highlight alternative approaches to implementing different parts of the process.\n\nWe begin with an overview of the system end-to-end, followed by more detailed views of the process\n\nin development, staging and production environments. These diagrams show the system as it operates\n\nin a steady state, with the finer details of iterative development cycles omitted.

Code source control is the primary conduit for deploying ML\n\npipelines from development to production. Pipelines and models are prototyped on a dev branch in the\n\ndevelopment environment, and changes to the codebase are committed back to source control. Upon merge\n\nrequest to the staging branch (usually the ‚Äúmain‚Äù branch), a continuous integration (CI) process tests the\n\ncode in the staging environment. If the tests pass, new code can be deployed to production by cutting a\n\ncode release. In production, a model is trained on the full production data and pushed to the MLflow Model\n\nRegistry. A continuous deployment (CD) process tests the model and promotes it toward the production\n\nstage in the registry. The Model Registry‚Äôs production model can be served via batch, streaming or REST API.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Dev\n\nIn the development environment, data scientists and ML engineers can collaborate on all pipelines in\n\nan ML project, committing their changes to source control. While engineers may help to configure this\n\nenvironment, data scientists typically have significant control over the libraries, compute resources and\n\ncode that they use.\n\n\n**Figure 4** Development environment\n\n0ÔøΩ\n\nEÔøΩploratory\ndata analysis\n\n0ÔøΩ\n\n\ndev\n\n\nSource control\n\nTracking Server\n\nMetrics Parameters Models\n\ndev\n\n\n. . .\n\nmodels\n\n\ntrain.py\n\ndeploy.py\n\nin(erence.py\n\nmonitoring.py\n\ndat<\n\n(eaturization.py\n\ntests\n\nunit.py\n\nintegration.py\n\n\nInference: Streaming or batch\n\n\nFeature table refresh\n\nData\nFeaturization\npreparation\n\n\nModel training\n\nTraining and\nEvaluation\ntuning\n\n\nCreate dev mrancg\n\n0u\n\nCommit code\n\n\n04\n\n\n\ndev\n\n\ndev\n\n\n0ÔøΩ\n\n\nLakehouse\n\n\nFeature tamles Bronze / Silver / Gold\n\nprod data\n\n\nFeature tamles Temp tamles\n\ndev data\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Data\n\nData scientists working in the dev environment possess read-only access to production data. They also\n\nrequire read-write access to a separate dev storage environment to develop and experiment with new\n\nfeatures and other data tables.\n\n###### Exploratory data analysis (EDA)\n\nThe data scientist explores and analyzes data in an interactive, iterative process. This process is used to\n\nassess whether the available data has the potential to address the business problem. EDA is also where the\n\ndata scientist will begin discerning what data preparation and featurization are required for model training.\n\nThis ad hoc process is generally not part of a pipeline that will be deployed in other execution environments.\n\n###### Project code\n\nThis is a code repository containing all of the pipelines or modules involved in the ML system. Dev branches\n\nare used to develop changes to existing pipelines or to create new ones. Even during EDA and initial phases of\n\na project, it is recommended to develop within a repository to help with tracking changes and sharing code.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Feature table refresh\n\nThis pipeline reads from raw data tables and feature tables and writes to tables in the Feature Store. The\n\npipeline consists of two steps:\n\n\u0007 **Data preparation**\n\nThis step checks for and corrects any data quality issues prior to featurization.\n\n**\u0007Featurization**\n\nIn the dev environment, new features and updated featurization logic can be tested by writing to feature\n\ntables in dev storage, and these dev feature tables can be used for model prototyping. Once this\n\nfeaturization code is promoted to production, these changes will affect the production feature tables.\n\nFeatures already available in production feature tables can be read directly for development.\n\nIn some organizations, feature engineering pipelines are managed separately from ML projects. In such\n\ncases, the featurization pipeline can be omitted from this architecture.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Model training\n\nData scientists develop the model training pipeline in the dev environment with dev or prod feature tables.\n\n\u0007 **Training and tuning**\n\nThe training process reads features from the feature store and/or Silver- or Gold-level Lakehouse tables,\n\nand it logs model parameters, metrics and artifacts to the [MLflow tracking server](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yCODhUuimWJHR8Sc-sd6xY7vJuN6nPek2pNrfhv7hU4/edit#heading=h.1yd956s4db32) . After training and\n\nhyperparameter tuning, the final model artifact is logged to the tracking server to record a robust link\n\nbetween the model, its input data, and the code used to generate it.\n\n**\u0007Evaluation**\n\nModel quality is evaluated by testing on held-out data. The results of these tests are logged to the\n\nMLflow tracking server.\n\nIf governance requires additional metrics or supplemental documentation about the model, this is the\n\ntime to add them using MLflow tracking. Model interpretations (e.g., plots produced by [SHAP](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) or [LIME](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938) )\n\nand plain text descriptions are common, but defining the specifics for such governance requires input\n\nfrom business stakeholders or a data governance officer.\n\n**\u0007Model output**\n\nThe output of this pipeline is an ML model artifact stored in the MLflow tracking server. When this\n\ntraining pipeline is run in staging or production, ML engineers (or their CI/CD code) can load the model\n\nvia the model URI (or path) and then push the model to the Model Registry for management and testing.\n\n###### Commit code\n\nAfter developing code for featurization, training, inference and other pipelines, the data scientist or\n\nML engineer commits the dev branch changes into source control. This section does not discuss the\n\ncontinuous deployment, inference or monitoring pipelines in detail; see the ‚ÄúProd‚Äù section below for more\n\ninformation on those.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Staging\n\nThe transition of code from development to production occurs in the staging environment. This code\n\nincludes model training code and ancillary code for featurization, inference, etc. Both data scientists and ML\n\nengineers are responsible for writing tests for code and models, but ML engineers manage the continuous\n\nintegration pipelines and orchestration.\n\nSource control\n\n0] 0_\n\ndev staging >main< release\n\nMerge reHuest to staging Cut release branch\n\nStaging environment\n\nCI trigger Merge\n\n0ÔøΩ\n\n\n**Figure 5**\n\n\nUnit tests\n(CI)\n\n\nTracking Server\n\n0ÔøΩ\n\nModel Registry\n\ndev\n\n\n03\n\nIntegration tests (CI)\n\n\nFeature\nStore tests\n\n\nModel\ntraining tests\n\n\nModel\ndeployment\ntests\n\n\nInference\ntests\n\n\nModel\nmonitoring\ntests\n\n\nLakehouse\n\n\ndev\n\nFeature tables Temp tables\n\nstaging data\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Data\n\nThe staging environment may have its own storage area for testing feature tables and ML pipelines. This\n\ndata is generally temporary and only retained long enough to run tests and to investigate test failures. This\n\ndata can be made readable from the development environment for debugging.\n\n###### Merge code\n\n\u0007 **Merge request**\n\nThe deployment process begins when a merge (or pull) request is submitted against the staging branch\n\nof the project in source control. It is common to use the ‚Äúmain‚Äù branch as the staging branch.\n\n**\u0007Unit tests (CI)**\n\nThis merge request automatically builds source code and triggers unit tests. If tests fail, the merge\n\nrequest is rejected.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Integration tests (CI)\n\nThe merge request then goes through integration tests, which run all pipelines to confirm that they function\n\ncorrectly together. The staging environment should mimic the production environment as much as is\n\nreasonable, running and testing pipelines for featurization, model training, inference and monitoring.\n\nIntegration tests can trade off fidelity of testing for speed and cost. For example, when models are\n\nexpensive to train, it is common to test model training on small data sets or for fewer iterations to reduce\n\ncost. When models are deployed behind REST APIs, some high-SLA models may merit full-scale load\n\ntesting within these integration tests, whereas other models may be tested with small batch jobs or a few\n\nqueries to temporary REST endpoints.\n\nOnce integration tests pass on the staging branch, the code may be promoted toward production.\n\n\u0007 **Merge**\n\nIf all tests pass, the new code is merged into the staging branch of the project. If tests fail, the CI/CD\n\nsystem should notify users and post results on the merge (pull) request.\n\nNote: It can be useful to schedule periodic integration tests on the staging branch, especially if the branch is\n\nupdated frequently with concurrent merge requests.\n\n###### Cut release branch\n\nOnce CI tests have passed on a commit in the staging branch, ML engineers can cut a release branch from\n\nthat commit.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 6**\n\n\n###### Prod\n\nThe production environment is typically managed by a select set of ML engineers and is where ML pipelines\n\ndirectly serve the business or application. These pipelines compute fresh feature values, train and test new\n\nmodel versions, publish predictions to downstream tables or applications, and monitor the entire process to\n\navoid performance degradation and instability. While we illustrate batch and streaming inference alongside\n\nonline serving below, most ML applications will use only one of these methods, depending on the business\n\nrequirements.\n\nProduction environment\n\n\n0b\n\n0ÔøΩ\n\n0ÔøΩ\n\n\nModel Registry\n\n\nOnline serving\n\n\nStage: None Stage: Staging Stage: Production\n\n\nLog\nrequests and\npredictions\n\nrelease\n\n\nLoad model for\nonline serving\n\n\nEnaÔøΩle online\nserving\n\n\nFeature table refresh\n\nData\nFeaturization\npreparation\n\nrelease\n\n0B\n\n\n0~\n\n\nLoad model for testing\n\n\nLoad model for testing Load model for inference\n\n\nInference: Batch or streaming\n\n\nRegister and request transition\n\nModel training\n\nTraining\nEvaluation\nand tuning\n\nrelease\n\n\nPromote to staging Promote to production\n\n\nModel\nData ingest\ninference\n\n\nPuÔøΩlish\npredictions\n\n\n03\n\n\nContinuous Deployment (CD)\n\n\nrelease\n\nMonitoring\n\n\nData ingest\n\n\nCheck model\nperformance\nand data drift\n\n\nPuÔøΩlish\nmetrics\n\n\nCompare\nStaging vs\nProduction\n\n\nRequest model\ntransition to\nProduction\n\nrelease\n\n\nCompliance\nchecks\n\n\n0ÔøΩ\n\n\nTrigger model training\n\n\nrelease\n\n\nData taÔøΩles Feature taÔøΩles Feature taÔøΩles Monitoring taÔøΩles\nLakehouse\n\n\n-----\n\nThough data scientists may not have write or compute access in the production environment, it is\n\nimportant to provide them with visibility to test results, logs, model artifacts and the status of ML pipelines\n\nin production. This visibility allows them to identify and diagnose problems in production.\n\n###### Feature table refresh\n\nThis pipeline transforms the latest production Lakehouse data into production feature tables. It can use batch\n\nor streaming computation, depending on the freshness requirements for downstream training and inference.\n\nThe pipeline can be defined as a [Databricks Job](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yCODhUuimWJHR8Sc-sd6xY7vJuN6nPek2pNrfhv7hU4/edit#heading=h.rxs6npet1ull) which is scheduled, triggered or continuously running.\n\n###### Model training\n\nThe model training pipeline runs either when code changes affect upstream featurization or training logic, or\n\nwhen automated retraining is scheduled or triggered. This pipeline runs on the full production data.\n\n\u0007 **Training and tuning**\n\nDuring the training process, logs are recorded to the [MLflow tracking server](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yCODhUuimWJHR8Sc-sd6xY7vJuN6nPek2pNrfhv7hU4/edit#heading=h.1yd956s4db32) . These include model\n\nmetrics, parameters, tags and the model itself.\n\nDuring development, data scientists may test many algorithms and hyperparameters, but it is common\n\nto restrict those choices to the top-performing options in the production training code. Restricting tuning\n\ncan reduce the variance from tuning in automated retraining, and it can make training and tuning faster.\n\n**\u0007Evaluation**\n\nModel quality is evaluated by testing on held-out production data. The results of these tests are\n\nlogged to the MLflow tracking server. During development, data scientists will have selected meaningful\n\nevaluation metrics for the use case, and those metrics or their custom logic will be used in this step.\n\n**\u0007Register and request transition**\n\nFollowing model training, the model artifact is registered to the [MLflow Model Registry](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yCODhUuimWJHR8Sc-sd6xY7vJuN6nPek2pNrfhv7hU4/edit#heading=h.1yd956s4db32) of the production\n\nenvironment, set initially to ‚Äôstage=None‚Äô. The final step of this pipeline is to request a transition of the\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Continuous deployment (CD)\n\nThe CD pipeline is executed when the training pipeline finishes and requests to transition the model to\n\n‚Äòstage=Staging‚Äô. There are three key tasks in this pipeline:\n\n\u0007 **Compliance checks**\n\nThese tests load the model from the Model Registry, perform compliance checks (for tags, documentation,\n\netc.), and approve or reject the request based on test results. If compliance checks require human\n\nexpertise, this automated step can compute statistics or visualizations for people to review in a manual\n\napproval step at the end of the CD pipeline. Regardless of the outcome, results for that model version\n\nare recorded to the Model Registry through metadata in tags and comments in descriptions.\n\nThe MLflow UI can be used to manage stage transition requests manually, but requests and transitions\n\ncan be automated via MLflow APIs and [webhooks](https://docs.databricks.com/applications/mlflow/model-registry-webhooks.html) . If the model passes the compliance checks, then\n\nthe transition request is approved and the model is promoted to ‚Äòstage=Staging‚Äô. If the model fails, the\n\ntransition request is rejected and the model is moved to ‚Äòstage=Archived‚Äô in the Model Registry.\n\n**\u0007Compare staging vs. production**\n\nTo prevent performance degradation, models promoted to ‚Äòstage=Staging‚Äô must be compared to the\n\n‚Äòstage=Production‚Äô models they are meant to replace. The metric(s) for comparison should be defined\n\naccording to the use case, and the method for comparison can vary from canary deployments to A/B\n\ntests. All comparison results are saved to metrics tables in the lakehouse.\n\nIf this is the first deployment and there is no ‚Äòstage=Production‚Äô model yet, the ‚Äòstage=Staging‚Äô model\n\nshould be compared to a business heuristic or other threshold as a baseline. For a new version\n\nof an existing ‚Äòstage=Production‚Äô model, the ‚Äòstage=Staging‚Äô model is compared with the current\n\n‚Äòstage=Production‚Äô model.\n\n\n-----\n\n**\u0007Request model transition to production**\n\nIf the candidate model passes the comparison tests, a request is made to transition it to\n\n‚Äòstage=Production‚Äô in the Model Registry. As with other stage transition requests, notifications,\n\napprovals and rejections can be managed manually via the MLflow UI or automatically through APIs and\n\nwebhooks. This is also a good time to consider human oversight, as it is the last step before a model is\n\nfully available to downstream applications. A person can manually review the compliance checks and\n\nperformance comparisons to perform checks which are difficult to automate.\n\n###### Online serving (REST APIs)\n\nFor lower throughput and lower latency use cases, online serving is generally necessary. With MLflow, it is\n\nsimple to deploy models to [Databricks Model Serving](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yCODhUuimWJHR8Sc-sd6xY7vJuN6nPek2pNrfhv7hU4/edit#heading=h.72shqep1kelf) , cloud provider serving endpoints, or on-prem or\n\ncustom serving layers.\n\nIn all cases, the serving system loads the production model from the Model Registry upon initialization. On\n\neach request, it fetches features from an online Feature Store, scores the data and returns predictions. The\n\nserving system, data transport layer or the model itself could log requests and predictions.\n\n###### Inference: batch or streaming\n\nThis pipeline is responsible for reading the latest data from the Feature Store, loading the model from\n\n‚Äòstage=Production‚Äô in the Model Registry, performing inference and publishing predictions. For higher\n\nthroughput, higher latency use cases, batch or streaming inference is generally the most cost-effective\n\noption.\n\nA batch job would likely publish predictions to Lakehouse tables, over a JDBC connection, or to flat files.\n\nA streaming job would likely publish predictions either to Lakehouse tables or to message queues like\n\nApache Kafka.¬Æ\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Monitoring\n\nInput data and model predictions are monitored, both for statistical properties (data drift, model\n\nperformance, etc.) and for computational performance (errors, throughput, etc.). These metrics are\n\npublished for dashboards and alerts.\n\n\u0007 **Data ingestion**\n\nThis pipeline reads in logs from batch, streaming or online inference.\n\n**\u0007Check accuracy and data drift**\n\nThe pipeline then computes metrics about the input data, the model‚Äôs predictions and the infrastructure\n\nperformance. Metrics that measure statistical properties are generally chosen by data scientists during\n\ndevelopment, whereas metrics for infrastructure are generally chosen by ML engineers.\n\n\u0007 **Publish metrics**\n\nThe pipeline writes to Lakehouse tables for analysis and reporting. Tools such as [Databricks SQL](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yCODhUuimWJHR8Sc-sd6xY7vJuN6nPek2pNrfhv7hU4/edit#heading=h.nsthucrt9k77) are used\n\nto produce monitoring dashboards, allowing for health checks and diagnostics. The monitoring job or the\n\ndashboarding tool issues notifications when health metrics surpass defined thresholds.\n\n**\u0007Trigger model training**\n\nWhen the model monitoring metrics indicate performance issues, or when a model inevitably becomes\n\nout of date, the data scientist may need to return to the development environment and develop a new\n\nmodel version.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Note:** While automated retraining is supported\n\nin this architecture, it isn‚Äôt required, and caution\n\n\n###### Retraining\n\nThis architecture supports automatic retraining using the same model training pipeline above. While we\n\nrecommend beginning with manually triggered retraining, organizations can add scheduled and/or triggered\n\nretraining when needed.\n\n\u0007 **Scheduled**\n\nIf fresh data are regularly made available, rerunning model training on a defined schedule can help models\n\nto keep up with changing trends and behavior.\n\n**\u0007Triggered**\n\nIf the monitoring pipeline can identify model performance issues and send alerts, it can additionally\n\ntrigger retraining. For example, if the distribution of incoming data changes significantly or if the model\n\nperformance degrades, automatic retraining and redeployment can boost model performance with\n\nminimal human intervention.\n\n\nmust be taken in cases where it is implemented.\n\n\nIt is inherently difficult to automate selecting the\n\ncorrect action to take from model monitoring\n\n\nWhen the featurization or retraining pipelines themselves begin to exhibit performance issues, the data\n\nscientist may need to return to the dev environment and resume experimentation to address such issues.\n\n\nalerts. For example, if data drift is observed, does\n\nit indicate that we should automatically retrain, or\n\ndoes it indicate that we should engineer additional\n\nfeatures to encode some new signal in the data?\n\n\n-----\n\n**CHAPTER 4:**\n## LLMOps ‚Äì Large Language Model Operations\n\n\n#### Large language models\n\nLLMs have splashed into the mainstream of business and news, and there is no doubt that they will disrupt\n\ncountless industries. In addition to bringing great potential, they present a new set of questions for MLOps:\n\n\u0007Is prompt engineering part of operations, and if so, what is needed?\n\n\u0007Since the ‚Äúlarge‚Äù in ‚ÄúLLM‚Äù is an understatement, how do cost/performance trade-offs change?\n\n\u0007Is it better to use paid APIs or to fine-tune one‚Äôs own model?\n\n‚Ä¶and many more!\n\nThe good news is that ‚ÄúLLMOps‚Äù (MLOps for LLMs) is not that different from traditional MLOps. However,\n\nsome parts of your MLOps platform and process may require changes, and your team will need to learn a\n\nmental model of how LLMs coexist alongside traditional ML in your operations.\n\nIn this section, we will explain what may change for MLOps when introducing LLMs. We will discuss several\n\nkey topics in detail, from prompt engineering to packaging, to cost/performance trade-offs. We also provide\n\na reference architecture diagram to illustrate what may change in your production environment.\n\n###### What changes with LLMs?\n\nFor those not familiar with large language models (LLMs), see [this summary](https://www.databricks.com/product/machine-learning/large-language-models) for a quick introduction. The\n\none-sentence summary is: LLMs are a new class of natural language processing (NLP) models that have\n\nsignificantly surpassed their predecessors in performance across a variety of tasks, such as open-ended\n\nquestion answering, summarization and execution of near-arbitrary instructions.\n\nFrom the perspective of MLOps, LLMs bring new requirements, with implications for MLOps practices and\n\nplatforms. We briefly summarize key properties of LLMs and the implications for MLOps here, and we delve\n\ninto more detail in the next section.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Table 3**\n\n\n\n|KEY PROPERTIES OF LLMS|IMPLICATIONS FOR MLOPS|\n|---|---|\n|LLMs are available in many forms: \u0007Very general proprietary models behind paid APIs \u0007Open source models that vary from general to specific applications \u0007Custom models fine-tuned for specific applications|Development process: Projects often develop incrementally, starting from existing, third-party or open source models and ending with custom fine-tuned models.|\n|Many LLMs take general natural language queries and instructions as input. Those queries can contain carefully engineered ‚Äúprompts‚Äù to elicit the desired responses.|Development process: Designing text templates for querying LLMs is often an important part of developing new LLM pipelines. Packaging ML artifacts: Many LLM pipelines will use existing LLMs or LLM serving endpoints; the ML logic developed for those pipelines may focus on prompt templates, agents or ‚Äúchains‚Äù instead of the model itself. The ML artifacts packaged and promoted to production may frequently be these pipelines, rather than models.|\n|Many LLMs can be given prompts with examples and context, or additional information to help answer the query.|Serving infrastructure: When augmenting LLM queries with context, it is valuable to use previously uncommon tooling such as vector databases to search for relevant context.|\n|LLMs are very large deep learning models, often ranging from gigabytes to hundreds of gigabytes.|Serving infrastructure: Many LLMs may require GPUs for real-time model serving. Cost/performance trade-offs: Since larger models require more computation and are thus more expensive to serve, techniques for reducing model size and computation may be required.|\n|LLMs are hard to evaluate via traditional ML metrics since there is often no single ‚Äúright‚Äù answer.|Human feedback: Since human feedback is essential for evaluating and testing LLMs, it must be incorporated more directly into the MLOps process, both for testing and monitoring and for future fine-tuning.|\n\n\n-----\n\nThe list above may look long, but as we will see in the next section, many existing tools and processes\n\nonly require small adjustments in order to adapt to these new requirements. Moreover, many aspects\n\ndo not change:\n\n\u0007The separation of development, staging and production remains the same\n\n\u0007Git version control and model registries remain the primary conduits for promoting pipelines and\n\nmodels toward production\n\n\u0007The lakehouse architecture for managing data remains valid and essential for efficiency\n\n\u0007Existing CI/CD infrastructure should not require changes\n\n\u0007The modular structure of MLOps remains the same, with pipelines for data refresh, model tuning,\n\nmodel inference, etc.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Discussion of key topics for LLMOps\n\nSo far, we have listed top potential changes to MLOps as you introduce LLMs. In this section, we will dive into\n\nmore details about selected topics.\n\n###### Prompt engineering\n\nPrompt engineering is the practice of adjusting the text prompt given to an LLM in order to elicit better\n\nresponses ‚Äî using engineering techniques. It is a very new practice, but some best practices are emerging.\n\nWe will cover a few tips and best practices and link to useful resources.\n\n**1** \u0007Prompts and prompt engineering are model-specific. A prompt given to two different models will\n\ngenerally _not_ produce the same results. Similarly, prompt engineering tips do not apply to all models.\n\nIn the extreme case, many LLMs have been fine-tuned for specific NLP tasks and do not even require\n\nprompts. On the other hand, very general LLMs benefit greatly from carefully crafted prompts.\n\n**2** \u0007When approaching prompt engineering, go from simple to complex: track, templatize and automate.\n\n\u0007Start by tracking queries and responses so that you can compare them and iterate to improve\n\nprompts. Existing tools such as MLflow provide tracking capabilities; see [MLflow LLM Tracking](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llm-tracking.html) for\n\nmore details. Checking structured LLM pipeline code into version control also helps with prompt\n\ndevelopment, for git diffs allow you to review changes to prompts over time. Also see the section\n\nbelow on packaging model and pipelines for more information about tracking prompt versions.\n\n\u0007Then, consider using tools for building prompt templates, especially if your prompts become complex.\n\nNewer LLM-specific tools such as [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html) and [LlamaIndex](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provide such templates and more.\n\n\u0007Finally, consider automating prompt engineering by replacing manual engineering with automated\n\ntuning. Prompt tuning turns prompt development into a data-driven process akin to hyperparameter\n\ntuning for traditional ML. The [Demonstrate-Search-Predict (DSP) Framework](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dsp) is a good example of a\n\ntool for prompt tuning.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Resources\n\nThere are lots of good resources about\nprompt engineering, especially for popular\n\nmodels and services:\n\n\u0007DeepLearning.AI course on [ChatGPT](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/)\n\n[Prompt Engineering](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/)\n\n\u0007DAIR.AI [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/)\n\n\u0007 [Best practices for prompt engineering](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6654000-best-practices-for-prompt-engineering-with-openai-api)\n\n[with the OpenAI API](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6654000-best-practices-for-prompt-engineering-with-openai-api)\n\n\n**3** \u0007Most prompt engineering tips currently published online are for ChatGPT, due to its immense\n\npopularity. Some of these generalize to other models as well. We will provide a few tips here:\n\n\u0007Use clear, specific prompts, which may include an instruction, context (if needed), a user query or\n\ninput, and a description of the desired output type or format\n\n\u0007Provide examples in your prompt (‚Äúfew-shot learning‚Äù) to help the LLM to understand what you want\n\n\u0007Tell the model how to behave, such as telling it to admit if it cannot answer a question\n\n\u0007Tell the model to think step-by-step or explain its reasoning\n\n\u0007If your prompt includes user input, use techniques to prevent prompt hacking, such as making it very\n\nclear which parts of the prompt correspond to your instruction vs. user input\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Packaging models or pipelines for deployment\n\nIn traditional ML, there are generally two types of ML logic to package for deployment: models and\n\npipelines. These artifacts are generally managed toward production via a Model Registry and Git version\n\ncontrol, respectively.\n\nWith LLMs, it is common to package ML logic in new forms. These may include:\n\n\u0007A lightweight call to an LLM API service (third party or internal)\n\n\u0007A ‚Äúchain‚Äù from LangChain or an analogous pipeline from another tool. The chain may call an LLM API or a\n\nlocal LLM model.\n\n\u0007An LLM or an LLM+tokenizer pipeline, such as a [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) pipeline. This pipeline may use a\n\npretrained model or a custom fine-tuned model.\n\n\u0007An engineered prompt, possibly stored as a template in a tool such as LangChain\n\nThough LLMs add new terminology and tools for composing ML logic, all of the above still constitute models\n\nand pipelines. Thus, the same tooling such as [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) can be used to package LLMs and LLM pipelines for\n\ndeployment. [Built-in model flavors](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html) include:\n\n\u0007PyTorch and TensorFlow\n\n\u0007Hugging Face Transformers (relatedly, see Hugging Face Transformers‚Äôs [MLflowCallback](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/callback#transformers.integrations.MLflowCallback) )\n\n\u0007LangChain\n\n\u0007OpenAI API\n\n\u0007(See the [documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html) for a complete list)\n\nFor other LLM pipelines, MLflow can package the pipelines via the [MLflow pyfunc flavor](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#python-function-python-function) , which can store\n\narbitrary Python code.\n\n\n**Note about prompt versioning:** Just as it is helpful\n\nto track model versions, it is helpful to track prompt\n\nversions (and LLM pipeline versions, more generally).\n\nPackaging prompts and pipelines as MLflow Models\n\nsimplifies versioning. Just as a newly retrained\n\nmodel can be tracked as a new model version in the\n\nMLflow Model Registry, a newly updated prompt can\n\nbe tracked as a new model version.\n\n**Note about deploying models vs. code:** Your\n\ndecisions around packaging ML logic as version\n\ncontrolled code vs. registered models will help\n\nto inform your decision about choosing between\n\nthe deploy models, deploy code and hybrid\n\narchitectures. Review the subsection below about\n\nhuman feedback, and make sure that you have a\n\nwell-defined testing process for whatever artifacts\n\nyou choose to deploy.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Managing cost/performance trade-offs\n\nOne of the big Ops topics for LLMs is managing cost/performance trade-offs, especially for inference\n\nand serving. With ‚Äúsmall‚Äù LLMs having hundreds of millions of parameters and large LLMs having hundreds\n\nof billions of parameters, computation can become a major expense. Thankfully, there are many ways to\n\nmanage and reduce costs when needed. We will review some key tips for balancing productivity and costs.\n\n**1** \u0007Start simple, but plan for scaling. When developing a new LLM-powered application, speed of\n\ndevelopment is key, so it is acceptable to use more expensive options, such as paid APIs for existing\n\nmodels. As you go, make sure to collect data such as queries and responses. In the future, you can use\n\nthat data to fine-tune a smaller, cheaper model which you can own.\n\n**2** \u0007Scope out your costs. How many queries per second do you expect? Will requests come in bursts?\n\nHow much does each query cost? These estimates will inform you about project feasibility and will help\n\nyou to decide when to consider bringing the model in-house with open source models and fine-tuning.\n\n**3** \u0007Reduce costs by tweaking LLMs and queries. There are many LLM-specific techniques for reducing\n\ncomputation and costs. These include shortening queries, tweaking inference configurations and using\n\nsmaller versions of models.\n\n**4** \u0007Get human feedback. It is easy to reduce costs but hard to say how changes impact your results,\n\nunless you get human feedback from end users.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Resources\n\n**Fine-tuning**\n\n\u0007 [Fine-Tuning Large Language Models with](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/03/20/fine-tuning-large-language-models-hugging-face-and-deepspeed.html)\n\n[Hugging Face and DeepSpeed](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/03/20/fine-tuning-large-language-models-hugging-face-and-deepspeed.html)\n\n\u0007Webinar: [Build Your Own Large Language](https://www.databricks.com/resources/webinar/build-your-own-large-language-model-dolly)\n\n[Model Like Dolly: How to fine-tune and](https://www.databricks.com/resources/webinar/build-your-own-large-language-model-dolly)\n[deploy your custom LLM](https://www.databricks.com/resources/webinar/build-your-own-large-language-model-dolly)\n\n**Model distillation,**\n**quantization and pruning**\n\n\n###### Methods for reducing costs of inference\n\n**Use a smaller model**\n\n\u0007Pick a different existing model. Try smaller versions of models (such as ‚Äút5-small‚Äù instead of ‚Äút5-base‚Äù)\n\nor alternate architectures.\n\n\u0007Fine-tune a custom model. With the right training data, a fine-tuned model can often be smaller and/or\n\nperform better than a generic model.\n\n\u0007Use model distillation (or knowledge distillation). This technique ‚Äúdistills‚Äù the knowledge of the original\n\nmodel into a smaller model.\n\n\u0007Reduce floating point precision (quantization). Models can sometimes use lower precision arithmetic\n\nwithout losing much in quality.\n\n\n\u0007 [Gentle Introduction to 8-bit Matrix](https://huggingface.co/blog/hf-bitsandbytes-integration)\n\n\n**\u0007Reduce computation for a given model**\n\n\u0007Shorten queries and responses. Computation scales with input and output sizes, so using more concise\n\nqueries and responses reduces costs.\n\n\u0007Tweak inference configurations. Some types of inference, such as beam search, require more computation.\n\n**Other**\n\n\u0007Split traffic. If your return on investment (ROI) for an LLM query is low, then consider splitting traffic so that\n\nlow ROI queries are handled by simpler, faster models or methods. Save LLM queries for high ROI traffic.\n\n\u0007Use pruning techniques. If you are training your own LLMs, there are pruning techniques that allow\n\nmodels to use sparse computation during inference. This reduces computation for most or all queries.\n\n\n[Multiplication for transformers at scale](https://huggingface.co/blog/hf-bitsandbytes-integration)\n[using Hugging Face Transformers,](https://huggingface.co/blog/hf-bitsandbytes-integration)\n[Accelerate and bitsandbytes](https://huggingface.co/blog/hf-bitsandbytes-integration)\n\n\u0007 [Large Transformer Model Inference](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-01-10-inference-optimization/)\n\n[Optimization](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-01-10-inference-optimization/)\n\n\u0007 [Making LLMs even more accessible with](https://huggingface.co/blog/4bit-transformers-bitsandbytes)\n\n[bitsandbytes, 4-bit quantization and](https://huggingface.co/blog/4bit-transformers-bitsandbytes)\n[QLoRA](https://huggingface.co/blog/4bit-transformers-bitsandbytes)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Human feedback, testing, and monitoring\n\nWhile human feedback is important in many traditional ML applications, it becomes much more important\n\nfor LLMs. Since most LLMs output natural language, it is very difficult to evaluate the outputs via traditional\n\nmetrics. For example, suppose an LLM were used to summarize a news article. Two equally good summaries\n\nmight have almost completely different words and word orders, so even defining a ‚Äúground-truth‚Äù label\n\nbecomes difficult or impossible.\n\nHumans ‚Äî ideally your end users ‚Äî become essential for validating LLM output. While you can pay human\n\nlabelers to compare or rate model outputs, the best practice for user-facing applications is to build human\n\nfeedback into the applications from the outset. For example, a tech support chatbot may have a ‚Äúclick here\n\nto chat with a human‚Äù option, which provides implicit feedback indicating whether the chatbot‚Äôs responses\n\nwere helpful.\n\nIn terms of operations, not much changes from traditional MLOps:\n\n\u0007 **Data:** Human feedback is simply data, and it should be treated like any other data. Store it in your\n\nlakehouse, and process it using the same data pipeline tooling as other data.\n\n\u0007 **Testing and monitoring:** A/B testing and incremental rollouts of new models and pipelines may become\n\nmore important, superceding offline quality tests. If you can collect user feedback, then these rollout\n\nmethods can validate models before they are fully deployed.\n\n\u0007 **Fine-tuning:** Human feedback becomes especially important for LLMs when it can be incorporated into\n\nfine-tuning models via techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Even if you\n\nstart with an existing or generic model, you can eventually customize it for your purposes via fine-tuning.\n\n\n###### Resources\n\n**Reinforcement Learning from**\n**Human Feedback (RLHF)**\n\n\u0007Chip Huyen blog post on\n\n[‚ÄúRLHF: Reinforcement Learning from](https://huyenchip.com/2023/05/02/rlhf.html)\n\n[Human Feedback‚Äù](https://huyenchip.com/2023/05/02/rlhf.html)\n\n\u0007Hugging Face blog post on\n\n[‚ÄúIllustrating Reinforcement Learning from](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf)\n\n[Human Feedback (RLHF)‚Äù](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf)\n\n\u0007 [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Other topics\n\n\u0007 **Scaling out:** Practices around scaling out training, fine-tuning and inference are similar to traditional ML,\n\nbut some of your tools may change. Tools like [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) [‚Ñ¢](https://spark.apache.org/) and [Delta Lake](https://delta.io/) remain general enough for\n\nyour LLM data pipelines and for batch and streaming inference, and they may be helpful for distributing\n\nfine-tuning. To handle LLM fine-tuning and training, you may need to adopt some new tools such as\n\n[distributed PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dist_overview.html) , [distributed TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/distributed_training) , and [DeepSpeed](https://www.deepspeed.ai/) .\n\n\u0007 **[Model serving:](https://www.databricks.com/product/model-serving)** If you manage the serving system for your LLMs, then you may need to make\n\nadjustments to handle larger models. While serving with CPUs can work for smaller deep learning\n\nmodels, most LLMs will benefit from or require GPUs for serving and inference.\n\n\u0007 **Vector databases:** Some but not all LLM applications require vector databases for efficient similarity-\n\nbased lookups of documents or other data. Vector databases may be an important addition to your\n\nserving infrastructure. Operationally, it is analogous to a feature store: it is a specialized tool for storing\n\npreprocessed data which can be queried by inference jobs or model serving systems.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Reference architecture\n\nTo illustrate potential adjustments to your reference architecture from traditional MLOps, we provide a\n\nmodified version of the previous production architecture.\n\nProduction environment\n\nModel Registry\n\nStage: ÔøΩone Stage: Staging Stage: Production\n\nLoad model for testing Load model for inference\n\n\nPush model to registry Promote to production\n\n\nModel serving\n\n\nLLM API request\n\nrelease\n\n\nFine-Tine LLM\n\nrelease\n\n\nVector Database\nUpdate\n\nrelease\n\n\nContinuous\nDeployment (CD)\n\nrelease\n\n\nMonitoring &\nEvaluation\n\nrelease\n\n\nInternal/External Data tables Vector database Metrics tables Human feedback\nmodel hub\n\n**Figure 7**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Additional resources\n\nWith LLMs being such a novel field, we link to\nseveral LLM resources below, which are not\n\nnecessarily ‚ÄúLLMOps‚Äù but may prove useful\nto you.\n\n\u0007 [edX: Professional Certificate in Large](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/databricks-large-language-models)\n\n[Language Models](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/databricks-large-language-models)\n\n\u0007Chip Huyen blog post on [‚ÄúBuilding LLM](https://huyenchip.com/2023/04/11/llm-engineering.html)\n\n[applications for production‚Äù](https://huyenchip.com/2023/04/11/llm-engineering.html)\n\nLLM lists and leaderboards\n\n\u0007 [LMSYS Leaderboard](https://chat.lmsys.org/?leaderboard)\n\n\u0007 [Hugging Face Open LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard)\n\n\u0007 [Stanford Center for Research on](https://crfm.stanford.edu/)\n\n[Foundation Models](https://crfm.stanford.edu/)\n\n\u0007 [Ecosystem graphs](https://crfm.stanford.edu/ecosystem-graphs/index.html)\n\u0007 [\u0007HELM](https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/latest/?)\n\n\u0007Blog post on [‚ÄúOpen Source ChatGPT](https://www.saattrupdan.com/posts/2023-04-16-open-source-chatgpt-alternatives)\n\n\nThe primary changes to this production architecture are:\n\n\u0007 **Internal/External Model Hub:** Since LLM applications often make use of existing, pretrained models,\n\nan internal or external model hub becomes a valuable part of the infrastructure. It appears here in\n\nproduction to illustrate using an existing base model that is then fine-tuned in production. Without fine-\n\ntuning, this hub would mainly be used in development.\n\n\u0007 **Fine-Tune LLM:** Instead of de novo Model Training, LLM applications will generally fine-tune an existing\n\nmodel (or use an existing model without any tuning). Fine-tuning is a lighter-weight process than training,\n\nbut it is similar operationally.\n\n\u0007 **Vector Database:** Some (but not all) LLM applications use vector databases for fast similarity searches,\n\nmost often to provide context or domain knowledge in LLM queries. We replaced the Feature Store (and\n\nits Feature Table Refresh job) with the Vector Database (and its Vector Database Update job) to illustrate\n\nthat these data stores and jobs are analogous in terms of operations.\n\n\u0007 **Model Serving:** The architectural change illustrated here is that some LLM pipelines will make external\n\nAPI calls, such as to internal or third-party LLM APIs. Operationally, this adds complexity in terms of\n\npotential latency or flakiness from third-party APIs, as well as another layer of credential management.\n\n\u0007 **Human Feedback in Monitoring and Evaluation:** Human feedback loops may be used in traditional ML\n\nbut become essential in most LLM applications. Human feedback should be managed like other data,\n\nideally incorporated into monitoring based on near real-time streaming.\n\n\n[Alternatives‚Äù](https://www.saattrupdan.com/posts/2023-04-16-open-source-chatgpt-alternatives)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Looking ahead\n\nLLMs only became mainstream in late 2022, and countless libraries and technologies are being built to\n\nsupport and leverage LLM use cases. You should expect rapid changes. More powerful LLMs will be open-\n\nsourced; tools and techniques for customizing LLMs and LLM pipelines will become more plentiful and\n\nflexible; and an explosion of techniques and ideas will gradually coalesce into more standardized practices.\n\nWhile this technological leap provides us all with great opportunities, the use of cutting-edge technologies\n\nrequires extra care in LLMOps to build and maintain stable, reliable LLM-powered applications. The good\n\nnews is that much of your existing MLOps tooling, practices and knowledge will transfer smoothly over to\n\nLLMs. With the additional tips and practices mentioned in this section, you should be well set up to harness\n\nthe power of large language models.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### About Databricks\n\nDatabricks is the data and AI company.

effectively acquire, engage,\n\nand retain players. Well, did you know that data, analytics,\n\nand AI plays a central role in the development and operation\n\nof today‚Äôs top-grossing video games? Studios globally\n\nstruggle with fragmented views of their audience, with data\n\noften outpacing legacy technologies. Today, the need for real-\n\ntime capabilities and the leap from descriptive to predictive\n\nanalytics has made it so that data, analytics, and AI are no\n\nlonger a ‚Äúnice-to-have‚Äù, but table stakes for success.\n\nThe objective of this handbook is to guide you on the\n\nrole data, analytics, and AI plays in the development\n\nand operations of video games. We‚Äôll cover who the key\n\nstakeholders are and how to align people across business\n\nunits. Then we‚Äôll talk through strategies to help you\n\nsuccessfully advocate for data, analytics, and AI projects\n\ninternally. Finally, we dive deep through the most common\n\nuse cases. We want to give you enough information to feel\n\n\nwell as helpful tips when operating as or working with one of\n\nthese classes.\n\nWe follow this with the fundamentals for building a Proof\n\nof Concept (POC) or Minimum Viable Product (MVP). That\n\nis, connecting to the cloud; accessing your data; and\n\nmost importantly, being able to represent the value you‚Äôre\n\nseeking to unlock as you sell your project into your team and\n\nbroader organization.\n\nFinally, we‚Äôll dive into the most common use cases for data,\n\nanalytics, and AI within game development. Similar to a tech-\n\ntree in a video game, we begin with the most basic use cases\n\n-  setting up your game analytics. Then we progress through\n\nmore advanced data use cases such as player segmentation,\n\nassessing lifetime value, detecting and mitigating toxicity,\n\nmulti-touch attribution, recommendation engines, player\n\nchurn prediction and prevention, and more.\n\nDon‚Äôt forget to review the Appendix. You‚Äôll find a handy\n\n‚Äú Jargon Glossary ‚Äù, ‚Äú Cloud Rosetta Stone ‚Äù, and ‚Äú get started\n\nguide for the three major cloud providers ‚Äù. All incredibly\n\nhelpful assets to keep as hotkeys.\n\n\nempowered to make a demonstrable impact. Just by reading\n\nthis you are adding incredible insight and value to yourself as\n\n\nan industry professional. Quest on!\n\n### How to use this book\n\nThis book is primarily intended for technical professionals\n\nwho are engaging with data within game studios. No\n\nmatter your role in the gaming industry, you will be able to\n\nglean key takeaways that will make you more effective in\n\nyour individual role and within the larger team ‚Äî be that\n\nproduction, art, engineering, marketing, or otherwise.\n\nBegin your journey by reviewing the ‚Äú **Data, Analytics, and AI**\n\n**Ground Rules** ‚Äù section to the right, which presents some This\n\nsection presents some rules and guidelines for interpreting\n\nthe role that data plays in the game development lifecycle.\n\nNext, it‚Äôs time to learn about the key professions (aka\n\ncharacter classes) that interact and engage with data,\n\nanalytics, and AI on a consistent basis within a game studio.\n\nThis section breaks down each of the classes, providing an\n\n\n**Data, Analytics, and AI Ground Rules**\n\nThis guide assumes you understand the following:\n\n-  You understand the basics of data, analytics, and AI:\n\nHow and why data is stored in a system, why data\n\nis transformed, the different types of output that\n\ndata can feed into ‚Äî such as a report, an analysis\n\nanswering a question, or a machine learning model.\n\nIf this is the first time you‚Äôre creating a character,\n\nwe highly recommend reviewing our data, analytics,\n\nand AI tutorial ‚Äî aka getting started training and\n\ndocumentation, available at [dbricks.co/training](https://www.databricks.com/learn/training/home)\n\n-  You have a basic understanding of cloud\n\ninfrastructure. Specifically what it is, who are the\n\nkey players, and associated terms (e.g., virtual\n\nmachines, APIs, applications)\n\n-  You are generally aware of the game development\n\nlifecycle; pre-production, production, testing/QA,\n\nlaunch, operation\n\n\noverview of each character‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses as\n\n\n-----\n\n# Business Value\n\n\nDemonstrating business value is important when working\n\non data, analytics, and AI projects because it helps ensure\n\nthat the efforts of the project are aligned with the goals\n\nand objectives of the business. By showing how the project\n\ncan positively impact a game‚Äôs key performance indicators\n\n(KPIs) and bottom-line metrics, such as game revenue, player\n\nsatisfaction, and operational efficiency, studio stakeholders\n\nare more likely to support and invest in the project.\n\nAdditionally, demonstrating business value can help justify\n\nthe resources, time, and money that are required to execute\n\nthe project, and can also help prioritize which projects should\n\nbe pursued. By focusing on business value, data, analytics,\n\nand AI projects can become strategic initiatives that\n\ncontribute to the long-term success of your game studio.\n\n### Talking to the business  (feels like combat)\n\nWhile we highly encourage everyone to read this section,\n\nyou may already feel confident understanding the needs and\n\nconcerns of your internal stakeholders, and how to sell-in a\n\nproject successfully. If so, feel free to skip this section.\n\nWe would love to dive into the data to explore and discover\n\nas much as possible, unfortunately in most environments,\n\nwe are limited by resources and time. Understanding both\n\nthe businesses pain points and strategic goals is crucial to\n\nchoosing projects that will benefit the business, create value\n\nand make your message much easier to sell.\n\nWhenever we embark on a proof-of-concept (PoC) or\n\nminimum viable product (MVP) ‚Äî to prove out a new\n\n**Questions to ask:**\n\n-  What other strategic goals and pain points can\n\nyou list out and how would you prioritize them as\n\na business leader?\n\n-  Does your prioritization match how your team,\n\nmanager and/or leadership would prioritize?\n\nTypically the closer the match, the easier initial\n\nprojects will be to ‚Äúsell‚Äù.\n\n\nmethodology or technology ‚Äî we will need to pitch it back\n\nfor adoption. The technology could be revolutionary and\n\nabsolutely amazing, but without the value proposition and tie\n\nback to goals, it is likely to land flat or fail to be adopted.\n\nIt is key to talk to your stakeholders to understand their\n\nperception of pain points and positions on potential projects\n\nto add value. Much like stopping at the Tavern when the\n\nadventuring party gets to town, these can be informal\n\nconversations where you socialize potential solutions while\n\ngathering information about what matters.\n\n### Creating value alignment\n\nSo what are your strategic goals and pain points and how\n\nmight they be addressed through a use case from a PoC or\n\nMVP leveraging your data?\n\nA few examples of strategic goals that are top of mind for our\n\ncustomers at the beginning of any fiscal or calendar year:\n\n-  Reduce costs\n\n-  Simplify your infrastructure\n\n-  Acquire more players\n\n-  Monetize your playerbase\n\n-  Retain your players (aka prevent churn)\n\nHere are four ways the Databricks Lakehouse can provide\n\nvalue that aligns with your strategic goals and pain points:\n\n`1.` **\u0007Improved collaboration:** Databricks platform allows\n\neveryone to share and collaborate on data, notebooks and\n\nmodels between data scientists, engineers and business\n\nusers. This enables for a more efficient and streamlined\n\nprocess for data analysis and decision making.\n\n`2.` **Find and explore your data:** The data in the Lakehouse is\n\ncataloged and accessible, which enables business users\n\nto explore and query the data easily and discover insights\n\nby themselves.\n\n`3.` **\u0007Uncover actionable business insights:** By putting\n\nyour game‚Äôs data into a Lakehouse architecture, it\n\ncan be better analyzed using various tools provided\n\nby Databricks such as SQL, dashboards, notebooks,\n\nvisualization and machine learning to better understand\n\nyour playerbase, providing valuable insights into player\n\nbehavior and performance. These insights can help the\n\n\n-----\n\nand retention, and use that information to improve the\n\ngame and grow monetization.\n\n`4.` **\u0007Lead with data-driven decisions:** A Lakehouse\n\narchitecture provides a single source of truth for your\n\norganization‚Äôs data. Data engineers write once, data\n\nanalysts interpret the data, and data scientists can run\n\nmachine machine learning models on the same data.\n\n_This cannot be understated in the value this provides an_\n\n_organization from a total cost of ownership perspective._\n\nWith the ability to access and analyze all the data in one\n\nplace, the business can make unified data-driven decisions,\n\nrather than relying on intuition or fragmented data.\n\n### Goals and outcomes\n\nLike many projects, starting with a strong foundation of ‚Äòwhat\n\nsuccess looks like‚Äô will significantly improve your likelihood\n\nof achieving your objectives. Here are a few best-practices\n\nwe recommend:\n\n`1.` **Set goals:** Define your hypothesis, then use your data\n\nand process to prove or disprove your hypothesis. You\n\nhave a goal in mind, make it part of the experiment. If\n\nthe outcome differs from the expectation, that is part of\n\nexperiments and we can learn from it to improve the next\n\nexperiment. This is all about shortening the feedback loop\n\n\nproject appropriately. For example, are you doing this as\n\na side project? Do you have 2 sprints to show progress?\n\nIt‚Äôs important to scope your project based on the time,\n\nresources, and quality needed for the said project to be a\n\nsuccess.\n\n`3.` **Scope down:** Ruthlessly control scope for any PoC or\n\nMVP. Prioritization is your best friend. Stakeholders and\n\nyour own internal team will naturally want to increase\n\nscope because there‚Äôs no shortage of good ideas. But by\n\ncontrolling scope, you improve your chances of shipping\n\non time and on budget. Don‚Äôt let perfection be the enemy\n\nof good. There are always exceptions to this, but that is\n\nwhat the next sprint is for.\n\n`4.` **Deliver on time:** Recovering lost goodwill is incredibly\n\ndifficult - strive to always deliver on time. Make sure your\n\ngoals, constraints and scope creep will not explode your\n\ntimeline as creating tight feedback loops and iteration\n\ncycles is what will make you more agile than the competition.\n\n`5.` **Socialize early, and often:** Show quantifiable value as\n\nquickly as possible, both to your immediate team and\n\nbusiness stakeholders. Measure the value as frequently\n\nas makes sense, and socialize early and often to promote\n\nvisibility of the project and ensure tight alignment across\n\nteams. This will empower you to create tighter feedback\n\nloops that will help improve any future iterations of your\n\nproduct, platform, or technology.\n\n\nbetween insight and action.\n\n# Ultimate Class Build Guide\n\n\n### Creating a character\n\nHave you rolled your character already? Data engineers, data\n\nscientists, and data analysts form the heart of mature game\n\ndata teams. Though, depending on studio size and resources,\n\n\nmaking sense of large amounts of data. Depending on the size\n\nof the organization, individuals may be required to multiclass\n\nin order to address needs of the team. In smaller studios, it‚Äôs\n\noften developers who wear multiple hats, including those in data\n\nengineering, analytics and data science. Key characters include:\n\n\ngame developers may also be pulled in from time to time to\n\n\nperform data engineering and or data science tasks. Though for\n\nthe sake of this guide, we‚Äôll keep focus on roles of data engineers,\n\ndata scientists, and data analysts. There are many aspects to\n\nthese roles, but they can be summarized in that Data Engineers\n\ncreate and maintain critical data workflows, Data Analysts\n\ninterpret data and create reports that keep the business teams\n\nrunning seamlessly, and Data Scientists are responsible for\n\n\n**Data Engineers**\n\nData engineers build systems that collect, manage, and\n\nconvert source data into usable information for data\n\nscientists and business analysts to interpret. Their ultimate\n\ngoal is to make data accessible so that teams can use it to\n\nevaluate and optimize a goal or objective.\n\n\n-----\n\nData scientists determine the questions their team should\n\nbe asking and figure out how to answer those questions\n\nusing data. They often develop predictive models for\n\ntheorizing and forecasting.\n\n**Data Analysts**\n\n\nto report on the health of a title or building a recommendation\n\nengine for your players, this guide will help you better\n\nunderstand the unique classes required to develop and\n\nmaintain an effective data, analytics, and AI platform.\n\n**Learn more about these character classes**\n\n\nA data analyst reviews data to identify key insights into a\n\ngame studio‚Äôs customers and ways the data can be used to\n\nsolve problems.\n\n# Diving In\n\n\nBefore we get to the primary use cases of game data,\n\nanalytics, and AI, we need to cover some basics. That is, the\n\ndifferent types of game data and how they are produced.\n\nAnd the subsequent receiving of that data in the cloud to\n\n\n### Producing game data‚Ä¶\n\nSpeaking in generalities, there are four buckets of data as it\n\nrelates to your video game.\n\n\ncollect, clean, and prepare for analysis.\n\n**1. Game Telemetry**\n\nGame telemetry refers to the data collected about player\n\nbehavior and interactions within a video game. The primary\n\ndata source is the game engine. And the goal of game\n\ntelemetry is to gather information that can help game\n\ndevelopers understand player behavior and improve the\n\noverall game experience.\n\nSome of the primary metrics that are typically tracked in\n\ngame telemetry include:\n\n-  **Player engagement:** Track the amount of time players\n\nspend playing the game, and their level of engagement\n\nwith different parts of the game.\n\n-  **Game progress:** Monitor player progress through\n\ndifferent levels and milestones in the game.\n\n-  **In-game purchases:** Track the number and value of\n\nin-game purchases made by players.\n\n-  **Player demographics:** Collect demographic information\n\nabout players, such as age, gender, location, and device type.\n\n-  **Session length:** Monitor the length of each player session,\n\nand how often players return to the game.\n\n-  **Retention:** Track the percentage of players who return to\n\nthe game after their first session.\n\n\n-----\n\nsuch as the types of actions taken, the number of deaths,\n\nand the use of power-ups.\n\n-  **User Acquisition:** Track the number of new players\n\nacquired through different marketing channels.\n\n**2. Business KPIs**\n\nThe second bucket of data is business key performance\n\nindicators (or KPIs). Business KPIs are metrics that measure\n\nthe performance and success of a video game from a\n\nbusiness perspective. The primary data source for business\n\nKPIs include game telemetry, stores, and marketplaces.\n\nThese KPIs help game studios understand the financial and\n\noperational performance of their games and make informed\n\ndecisions about future development and growth.\n\nSome of the primary business metrics that are typically\n\ntracked include:\n\n-  **Revenue:** Track the total revenue generated by the game,\n\nincluding sales of the game itself, in-game purchases,\n\nand advertising.\n\n-  **Player Acquisition Cost (CAC):** Calculate the cost\n\nof acquiring a new player, including marketing and\n\nadvertising expenses.\n\n-  **Lifetime Value (LTV):** Estimate the amount of revenue a\n\nplayer will generate over the course of their time playing\n\nthe game.\n\n-  **Player Retention:** Track the percentage of players who\n\ncontinue to play the game over time, and how long they\n\nplay for.\n\n-  **Engagement:** Measure the level of engagement of players\n\nwith the game, such as the number of sessions played,\n\ntime spent playing, and in-game actions taken.\n\n-  **User Acquisition:** Track the number of new players\n\nacquired through different marketing channels and the\n\ncost of acquiring each player.\n\n-  **Conversion Rate:** Measure the percentage of players who\n\nmake an in-game purchase or complete a specific action.\n\n-  **Gross Margin:** Calculate the profit generated by the game\n\nafter subtracting the cost of goods sold, such as the cost\n\nof game development and server hosting.\n\n**3. Game Services**\n\nSimilar to game telemetry, game services provide critical\n\ninfrastructure that requires careful monitoring and management.\n\nThese services include things like game server hosting,\n\n\nand more. Here the source of data is the game services used.\n\nSome of the common metrics game teams typically track for\n\nthese services include:\n\n-  **Concurrent Players:** Track the number of players who are\n\nsimultaneously connected to the game servers to ensure\n\nthat the servers have enough capacity to handle the\n\nplayer demand.\n\n-  **Server Availability:** Monitor the uptime and downtime of\n\nthe game servers to ensure that players have access to\n\nthe game when they want to play, particularly important\n\nfor global live service games where demand fluctuates\n\nthrought the day.\n\n-  **Latency:** Measure the time it takes for data to travel\n\nfrom the player‚Äôs device to the game server and back,\n\nto ensure that players have a smooth and responsive\n\ngaming experience.\n\n-  **Network Bandwidth:** Monitor the amount of data being\n\ntransmitted between the player‚Äôs device and the game\n\nserver to ensure that players have a high-quality gaming\n\nexperience, even on slow internet connections.\n\n-  **Live Operations:** Monitor the success of in-game events,\n\npromotions, and other live operations to understand what\n\nresonates with players and what doesn‚Äôt.\n\n-  **Player Feedback:** Monitor player feedback and reviews,\n\nincluding ratings and comments on social media, forums,\n\nand app stores, to understand what players like and dislike\n\nabout the game.\n\n-  **Chat Activity:** Track the number of messages and\n\ninteractions between players in the game‚Äôs chat channels\n\nto understand the level of social engagement and\n\ncommunity building in the game.\n\n**4. Data beyond the game**\n\nThe last bucket comes from data sources beyond the video\n\ngame. These typically include the following:\n\n-  **Social Media Data:** Social media platforms, such as\n\nFacebook, Twitter, TikTok and Instagram, can provide\n\nvaluable insights into player behavior, feedback and\n\npreferences, as well as help game teams understand\n\nhow players are talking about their games online with\n\ndifferent communities.\n\n-  **Forum Data:** Online forums and discussion boards, such\n\nas Reddit and Discord, can be rich sources of player\n\nfeedback and opinions about the game.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### The secret to success is bringing all of the disparate data sources\n together, so you have as complete a 360-degree view as possible of\n what‚Äôs happening in and around your game.\n\n\n\n-  **Player Reviews:** Ratings and reviews on app stores, such\n\nas Steam, Epic, Google Play and the Apple App Store, can\n\nprovide valuable feedback on player experiences and help\n\ngame teams identify areas for improvement.\n\n-  **Third-Party Data:** Third-party data sources, such as\n\nmarket research firms and industry data providers, can\n\nprovide valuable insights into broader gaming trends and\n\nhelp game teams make informed decisions about their\n\ngames and marketing strategies.\n\nThis is a lot of data. And it‚Äôs no wonder that studios globally\n\nstruggle with fragmented views of their audience, with data\n\noften outpacing legacy technologies. Today, the need for real-\n\ntime capabilities and the leap from descriptive to predictive\n\nanalytics has made it so that data, analytics, and AI are now\n\ntable stakes for a game to be successful. Tapping into these\n\nfour buckets of data sources, you‚Äôll find actionable insights that\n\ndrive better understanding of your playerbase, more efficient\n\nacquisition, stronger and longer lasting engagement, and\n\nmonetization that deepens the relationship with your players.\n\nThat‚Äôs what we‚Äôre going to dig into throughout the rest of\n\nthis book.\n\n**Let‚Äôs begin with how to get data out of your game!**\n\nThere are a variety of ways to get data out of the game and\n\ninto cloud resources. In this section, we will provide resources\n\nfor producing data streams in Unity and Unreal. In addition,\n\nwe will also provide a generic approach that will work for any\n\ngame engine, as long as you are able to send HTTP requests.\n\n**Unity**\n\nSince Unity supports C#, you would use a .NET SDK from the\n\ncloud provider of your choice. All three major cloud providers\n\n\n[using AWS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv4ynyCytdU) is provided here.\n\n-  **AWS:** [AWS .NET SDK - Unity considerations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/v3/developer-guide/unity-special.html)\n\n-  **GCP:** [GCP .NET SDK Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dotnet/docs/reference)\n\n-  **Azure:** [Azure .NET SDK Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/azure/sdk/azure-sdk-for-dotnet)\n\n-  **Kafka (Open-source alternative):** [Kafka .NET connector](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-dotnet)\n\nFrom here, the SDK is used to send data to a messaging\n\nservice. These messaging services will be covered in more\n\ndetail in the next section.\n\n**Unreal Engine**\n\nUnreal supports development with C++, so you could use\n\nC++ SDKs or Blueprint interfaces to those SDKs.\n\nThe resources for each SDK are provided here\n\n-  **AWS:** [How to integrate AWS C++ SDK with Unreal Engine](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/gametech/how-to-integrate-the-aws-c-sdk-with-unreal-engine/)\n\n-  **Azure:** [Azure C++ SDK with PlayFab](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/playfab/sdks/unreal/)\n\n-  **Kafka (Open-source alternative):** [Getting started with](https://docs.confluent.io/kafka-clients/librdkafka/current/overview.html#ak-cplus)\n\n[Kafka and C++](https://docs.confluent.io/kafka-clients/librdkafka/current/overview.html#ak-cplus)\n\nJust like with the Unity example above, from here the data is\n\nsent to a messaging streaming service.\n\nOther engines may not support C++ or C#, but there is still a\n\nway to get your data into the cloud, no matter the language!\n\nBy hitting an API Gateway with a HTTP POST request, you are\n\nable to send data to cloud services from many more types of\n\napplications. A sample high level architecture of this solution\n\nin AWS and Azure can be seen below:\n\n**AWS:**\n\n\nhave .NET SDKs to use and I have linked the documentation\n\n\n**Azure:**\n\n\nfor each below.\n\nNo matter the cloud provider, if you want to use a SDK you\n\ninstall it through the NuGet package manager into your Unity\n\nproject. [A walkthrough of how to implement the .NET SDK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv4ynyCytdU)\n\n\n-----\n\nOnce the data has been sent from the game into an event-\n\nstreaming service, how do we get that data to a more\n\npermanent home? Here we will start by outlining what these\n\nmessaging services do and how we can use them to point\n\nour data to a desired location.\n\nMessaging services ingest real-time event data, being\n\nstreamed to them from a number of different sources,\n\nand then send them to their appropriate target locations.\n\nThese target locations can be databases, compute clusters\n\nor cloud object stores. A key property of the messaging\n\nservices is to preserve the time in which the events arrive, so\n\nthat it is always known the order that events occurred.\n\n\n\n-  Data is stored in object storage such as S3, Azure Storage\n\nor GCP Buckets using Delta Lake.\n\n-  Delta Lake is an open-source storage framework that makes\n\nit easy to maintain data consistency and track changes.\n\n**Data Governance & Cataloging:**\n\n-  Unity Catalog in Databricks provides tools for data\n\ngovernance that helps with compliance and controlling\n\naccess to data in the lake.\n\n-  Unity Catalog also allows to track data lineage, auditing and\n\ndata discovery with the use of data catalogs and governance.\n\n-  Metadata about the data including the structure, format,\n\nand location of the data can be stored in a data catalog.\n\n\nExamples of cloud messaging services include AWS Kinesis\n\n\nFirehose, Google PubSub, and Azure Event Hubs Messaging.\n\nIf you prefer to use open-source products, Apache Kafka is a\n\nvery popular open-source alternative.\n\n### Getting data from your  game to the cloud\n\nMoving to the cloud platform part of the journey involves\n\nbuilding a gaming Lakehouse. The gaming Lakehouse allows\n\ngaming companies to store, manage, and analyze large volumes\n\nof gaming data, such as player behavior, performance metrics,\n\nand financial transactions, to gain valuable insights and make\n\ndata-driven decisions to improve their business outcomes.\n\n**Next here are the basics of the Databricks**\n\n**platform simplified.**\n\n**Data Ingestion:**\n\n-  Data can be ingested into the Gaming Lakehouse using\n\nvarious built-in data ingestion capabilities provided by\n\nDatabricks such as Structured Streaming and Delta Live\n\nTables for a single simple API that handles streaming or\n\nbatch pipelines.\n\n-  Data can be ingested in real-time or batch mode from\n\n\n**Data Quality:**\n\n-  Databricks platform enables you to validate, clean\n\nand enrich data using built-in libraries and rule-based\n\nvalidation using Delta Live Tables.\n\n-  It also allows tracking data quality issues and missing\n\nvalues by using Databricks Delta Live Tables tables.\n\n**Data Security:**\n\n-  Databricks provides a comprehensive security model to\n\nsecure data stored in the lake.\n\n-  Access to data can be controlled through robust access\n\ncontrols on objects such as catalogs, schemas, tables,\n\nrows, columns, models, experiments, and clusters.\n\n**Analytics:**\n\n-  The processed data can be analyzed using various\n\ntools provided by Databricks such as SQL Dashboards,\n\nNotebooks, visualizations and ML.\n\n-  Game studios can gain insights into player performance and\n\nbehaviorto better engageplayers and improve their games.\n\n**Get started with your preferred cloud**\n\n\nvarious sources such as game clients, servers or APIs.\n\nData can be cleaned, transformed and enriched with\n\nadditional data sources, making it ready for analysis.\n\n\n-----\n\n# The Value of Data Throughout the Game Development Lifecycle\n\n\n### Lifecycle overview\n\nOver the last decade, the way games have been developed\n\nand monetized has changed dramatically. Most if not all\n\ntop grossing games are now built using a games-as-service\n\nstrategy, meaning titles shipped in cycles of constant\n\niteration to increase engagement and monetization of\n\nplayers over time. Games-as-a-Service models have the\n\nability to create sticky, high-margin games, but they also\n\nheavily depend on cloud-based services such as game\n\nplay analytics, multiplayer servers and matchmaking, player\n\nrelationship management, performance marketing and more.\n\nData plays an integral role in the development and operation\n\nof video games. Teams need tools and services to optimize\n\nplayer lifetime value (LTV) with databases that can process\n\nterabytes-petabytes of evolving data, analytics solutions\n\nthat can access that data with near real-time latency, and\n\nmachine learning (ML) models that can translate insights into\n\nactionable and innovative gameplay features.\n\nA game‚Äôs development lifecycle is unique to each studio. With\n\ndifferent skillsets, resources, and genres of games, there is no\n\n\none model. Below is a simplified view of a game development\n\nlifecycle for a studio running a games-as-a-service model.\n\nWhat‚Äôs important to remember is that throughout your title‚Äôs\n\ndevelopment lifecycle, there is data that can help you better\n\nunderstand your audience, more effectively find and acquire\n\nplayers, and more easily activate and engage them. Whether\n\nusing game play data to optimize creative decision making\n\nduring pre-production, tapping machine learning models to\n\npredict and prevent churn, or identifying the next best offer\n\nor action for your players in real-time, **data is your friend** .\n\n### Use data to develop a next-generation customer experience\n\nIn the game industry, customer experience (CX) is an\n\nimportant factor that can impact a player‚Äôs enjoyment of a\n\ngame and the length they choose to play that game over time.\n\nIn today‚Äôs highly competitive and fast-paced games industry,\n\na game studio‚Äôs ability to deliver exceptional and seamless\n\ncustomer experiences can be a strategic differentiator when\n\nit comes to cutting through the noise and winning a gamer‚Äôs\n\n\n## Game Development Lifecycle\n\n**Game Development Lifecycle**\n\n#### Games-as-a-Service (GaaS) / Games-as-a-Community (GaaC) Game-as-a-service (GaaS) / Game-as-a-Community (GaaC)\n\n\n**Game Development Lifecycle**\n\n\n_Game-as-a-service (GaaS) / Game-as-a-Community (GaaC)_\n\n\n**1.

Next\n\ngeneration customer experience involves providing a\n\nseamless and integrated support experience across all\n\nthese channels in near-real time.\n\n`3.` **Continuous improvement:** Game studios can use data\n\nand feedback from players to continuously improve\n\n\ngathering feedback on new features and using it to refine\n\nand optimize the game over time.\n\nIn summary, defining what a next generation customer\n\nexperience looks like for your game is important because it can\n\nhelp you create a more personalized, seamless, and enjoyable\n\nexperience for your players, which can lead to increased\n\nengagement, monetization, and loyalty. There are many\n\nways teams can use data throughout a game‚Äôs development\n\nlifecycle, but far and away the most valuable focus area will be\n\nin building and refining the customer experience.\n\nThroughout the rest of this guide, we will dig into the most\n\ncommon use cases for data, analytics, and AI in game\n\ndevelopment, starting with where we recommend everyone\n\nbegins: game analytics.\n\n\n# Getting Started with Gaming Use Cases\n\n\n### Where do I start?  Start with game analytics\n\n**Overview**\n\nBig question: Where‚Äôs the best place to start when it comes\n\nto game data, analytics, and AI? For most game studios,\n\nthe best place to start is with game analytics. Setting up a\n\ndashboard for your game analytics that helps you correlate\n\ndata across disparate sources is infinitely valuable in a world\n\n\nwhere there is no one gaming data source to rule them all.\n\nAn effective dashboard should include your game telemetry\n\ndata, data from any game services you‚Äôre running, and data\n\nsources outside of your game such as stores, marketplaces,\n\nand social media. See below.\n\n**What we‚Äôre trying to solve/achieve**\n\nGetting a strong foundation in game analytics unlocks more\n\nadvanced data, analytics, and AI use cases. For example,\n\nconcurrent player count plus store and marketplace data\n\n\n**GAME TELEMETRY**\n\n\n**Data Sources**\n\n**GAME SERVICES** **OTHER SOURCES**\n\n\n-----\n\nand lifetime value. Usage telemetry combined with crash\n\nreporting and social media listening helps you more quickly\n\nuncover where players might be getting frustrated. And\n\ncorrelating chat logs, voice transcriptions, and or discord\n\n\nthat are relevant and engaging to your players, giving you\n\ntools to effectively market and monetize with your audience.\n\n**Let‚Äôs start with Player Segmentation.**\n\n\nand reddit forums can help you identify disruptive behavior\n\n\nbefore it gets out of hand, giving you the tools to take\n\nactionable steps to mitigate toxicity within your community.\n\n**Get started and set up your Analytics Dashboard**\n\n### Understand your audience\n\nWith your analytics pipelines set up, the first area of focus is to\n\nbetter understand your audience. This can help you inform a\n\nvariety of key business decisions, from the highest macro order\n\nof ‚Äúwhat game(s) to develop‚Äù, to how to market and monetize\n\nthose games, and how to optimize the player experience.\n\nBy understanding the demographics, preferences, and\n\nbehaviors of their audience, a game studio can create games\n\nthat are more likely to appeal to their target market and be\n\nsuccessful. You can also use this understanding to tailor your\n\nmarketing and monetization strategies to the needs and\n\npreferences of your players.\n\nAdditionally, understanding your audience can help you\n\n\n##### Player Segmentation\n\n**Overview**\n\nPlayer segmentation is the practice of dividing players\n\ninto groups based on shared characteristics or behaviors.\n\nSegmentation has a number of benefits. You can better\n\nunderstand your players, create more personalized content,\n\nimprove player retention, and optimize monetization, all of\n\nwhich contributes to an improved player experience.\n\n**What we‚Äôre trying to solve/achieve**\n\nThe primary objective of segmentation is to ensure you‚Äôre\n\nnot treating your entire playerbase the exact same. Humans\n\nare different, and your players have different motivations,\n\npreferences and behaviors. Recognizing this and engaging\n\nwith them in a way that meets them where they‚Äôre at\n\nis one of the most impactful ways you can cultivate\n\nengagement with your game. As we mentioned above,\n\nthe benefits of segmentation are broad reaching. Through\n\nbetter understanding of your playerbase, you can better\n\npersonalize experiences, tailoring content and customer\n\nexperience to specific groups of players that increases\n\nengagement and satisfaction. Better understanding of\n\nyour players also helps in improving player retention. By\n\nidentifying common characteristics of players who are at\n\nrisk of churning (i.e., stopping play), you can develop targeted\n\nstrategies that only reach specific audiences.\n\nCreate advanced customer segments to build out more\n\neffective user stories, and identify potential purchasing\n\npredictions based on behaviors. Leverage existing sales\n\ndata, campaigns and promotions systems to create robust\n\nsegments with actionable behavior insights to inform your\n\nproduct roadmap. You can then use this information to build\n\nuseful customer clusters that are targetable with different\n\npromos and offers to drive more efficient acquisition and\n\ndeeper engagement with existing players.\n\n\nidentify potential pain points or areas for improvement\n\n\nwithin your games, allowing you to proactively make changes\n\n\n**Get started with Player Segmentation**\n\n\nto address these issues and improve the player experience\n\nbefore a player potentially churns.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Overview**\n\nPlayer lifetime value (LTV) is a measure of the value that a\n\nplayer brings to a game over the lifetime they play that game.\n\nIt is typically calculated by multiplying the average revenue\n\nper user (ARPU) by the average player lifespan. For example,\n\nif the average player spends $50 per year and plays the\n\ngame for 2 years, their LTV would be $50 * 2 = $100.\n\n**What we‚Äôre trying to solve/achieve**\n\nGame studios care about LTV because it helps them\n\nunderstand the long-term value of their players and make\n\ninformed decisions about how to invest in player acquisition\n\nand retention. For example, if the LTV of a player is higher\n\nthan the cost of acquiring them (e.g., through advertising),\n\nit may be worth investing more in player acquisition. On the\n\nother hand, if the LTV of a player is lower than the cost of\n\nacquiring them, it may be more cost-effective to focus on\n\nretaining existing players rather than acquiring new ones.\n\nLTV is one of the more important metrics that game studios,\n\nparticularly those building live service games, can use to\n\nunderstand the value of their players. It is important to\n\nconsider other metrics as well, such as player retention,\n\nmonetization, and engagement.\n\n**Get started with Player Lifetime Value**\n\n##### Social Media Monitoring\n\n**Overview**\n\nAs the great Warren Buffet once said, ‚ÄúIt takes 20 years to\n\nbuild a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think\n\nabout that, you‚Äôll do things differently.‚Äù Now more than ever,\n\npeople are able to use social media and instantly amplify\n\ntheir voices to thousands of people who share similar\n\ninterests and hobbies. Take Reddit as an example. r/gaming,\n\nthe largest video game community (also called a subreddit)\n\nhas over 35 million members with nearly 500 new posts\n\nand 10,000 new comments per day, while over 120 game-\n\nspecific subreddits have more than 10,000 members each,\n\nthe largest being League of Legends with over 700,000\n\nmembers. The discourse that takes place on online social\n\nplatforms generates massive amounts of raw and organic\n\n\nbe used to understand how customers think and discover\n\nexactly what they want.\n\nThe act and process of monitoring content online across the\n\ninternet and social media for keyword mentions and trends\n\nfor downstream processing and analytics is called media\n\nmonitoring. By applying media monitoring to social media\n\nplatforms, game developers are able to gain new advantages\n\nthat previously might not have been possible, including:\n\n-  Programmatically aggregate product ideas for new\n\nfeature prioritization\n\n-  Promote a better user experience by automatically\n\nresponding to positive or negative comments\n\n-  Understand the top influencers in the industry who can\n\nsway public opinion\n\n-  Monitor broader industry trends and emerging segments\n\nsuch as free-to-play games\n\n-  Detect and react to controversies or crises as they begin\n\n-  Get organic and unfiltered feedback of games and features\n\n-  Understand customer sentiment at scale\n\n-  Make changes faster to keep customer satisfaction high\n\nand prevent churn\n\nBy failing to monitor, understand, and act on what customers\n\nare saying about the games and content you release as\n\nwell as broader industry trends, you risk those customers\n\nleaving for a better experience that meets the demands and\n\nrequirements of what customers want.\n\n**What we‚Äôre trying to solve/achieve**\n\nBy monitoring and listening to what existing and potential\n\ncustomers are saying on social media, game developers\n\nare able to get a natural and organic understanding of how\n\ncustomers actually feel about the games and products they\n\nrelease, or gauge consumer interest before investing time\n\nand money in a new idea. The main process for social media\n\nmonitoring is to gather data from different social media\n\nplatforms, such as Twitter or YouTube, process those comments\n\nor tweets, then take action on the processed data. While\n\ncustomer feedback can be manually discovered and processed\n\nin search of certain keyword mentions or feedback, it is a much\n\nbetter idea to automate it and do it programmatically.\n\n**Get started with Social Media Monitoring**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Overview**\n\nPlayer feedback analysis is the process of collecting,\n\nanalyzing, and acting on player feedback to inform game\n\ndevelopment. It involves collecting player feedback from\n\nmultiple sources, such as in-game surveys, customer\n\nsupport tickets, social media, marketplace reviews, and\n\nforums, and using data analytics tools to identify patterns,\n\ntrends, and insights. The goal of player feedback analysis is\n\nto better understand player needs, preferences, and pain\n\npoints, and use this information to inform game development\n\ndecisions and improve the overall player experience.\n\nPlayer feedback analysis is an important part of game\n\ndevelopment as it helps ensure that the game continues to\n\nmeet player needs and expectations. By regularly collecting and\n\nanalyzing player feedback, game studios can make data-driven\n\ndecisions to improve the game, increase player engagement\n\nand retention, and ultimately drive success and growth.\n\nFor this use case, we‚Äôre going to focus on taking online\n\nreviews for your video game and categorizing the different\n\ntopics players are talking about (bucketing topics) in order\n\nto better understand the themes (via positive or negative\n\nsentiment) affecting your community.\n\n**What we‚Äôre trying to solve/achieve**\n\nThis is incredibly helpful, providing data-driven customer\n\ninsight into your development process. Whether used in\n\n\n**Overview**\n\nAcross massively multiplayer online video games (MMOs),\n\nmultiplayer online battle arena games (MOBAs) and other\n\nforms of online gaming, players continuously interact in real\n\ntime to either coordinate or compete as they move toward a\n\ncommon goal ‚Äî winning. This interactivity is integral to game\n\nplay dynamics, but at the same time, it‚Äôs a prime opening for\n\ntoxic behavior ‚Äî an issue pervasive throughout the online\n\nvideo gaming sphere.\n\nToxic behavior manifests in many forms, such as the varying\n\ndegrees of griefing, cyberbullying and sexual harassment\n\nthat are illustrated in the matrix below from [Behaviour](http://gamestudies.org/2004/articles/deslauriers_iseutlafrancestmartin_bonenfant)\n\n[Interactive](http://gamestudies.org/2004/articles/deslauriers_iseutlafrancestmartin_bonenfant) , which lists the types of interactions seen within\n\nthe multiplayer game, _Dead by Daylight_ .\n\n\npre-production, such as looking at games that are similar\n\n\n**Survivors**\n\n\nwith reviews to learn where those games have strengths and\n\nweaknesses; or using player feedback analysis with a live\n\nservice title to identify themes that can apply to your product\n\nroadmap, player feedback analysis helps teams better\n\nsupport and cultivate engagement with the player community.\n\n\n**GEN**\n\n**RUSHING**\n\n\n**GEN**\n\n\n**HIDING** **ACTIVATING** **LOOPING**\n**EMOTES**\n\n\n**RUSH** **BLINDING** **SANDBAGGING**\n**UNHOOKING**\n\n**TEABAGGING**\n\n\n**REPORTING** **REPORTING**\n\n\n**REPORTING** **REPORTING**\n\n\n**TEXT**\n**CHATTING**\n\n\nUltimately, player feedback analysis does two things. 1) It\n\n\n**Less**\n\n**toxic**\n\n\n**Most**\n**toxic**\n\n\ncan help you stack rank themes according to positive and\n\nnegative sentiment, and 2) you can weight those themes\n\naccording to impact on player engagement, toxicity,\n\nmonetization, churn, and more. We‚Äôve all read reviews that\n\nare overly positive, or overly negative. The process of player\n\nfeedback analysis helps to normalize feedback across the\n\ncommunity (keeping in mind, only for those who have written\n\na review), so you‚Äôre not over indexing on one review, or a\n\n\n**HATCH** **HATCH**\n**DISCONNECTING** **DISCONNECTING** **FARMING** **FARMING**\n\n\n**HATCH** **HATCH**\n**DISCONNECTING** **DISCONNECTING** **FARMING** **FARMING**\n\n**CAMPING** **CAMPING**\n\n\n**FARMING** **FARMING**\n\n\n**CAMPING** **CAMPING**\n\n\n**BEING AWAY**\n**FROM**\n**KEYBOARD**\n**(AFK)**\n\n\n**CAMPING**\n\n**DRIBBLING** **TUNNELING**\n\n\n**LOBBY**\n**DODGING**\n\n**BODY**\n**BLOCKING**\n\n**FACE**\n**SLUGGING** **CAMPING**\n\n\n**Killers**\n\n\nsingle theme that may seem in the moment very pressing.\n\nIn addition to the [personal toll](https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2021/faculty-voice-gaming-and-toxicity) that toxic behavior can have\n\n\n**Get started with Player Feedback Analysis**\n\n\non gamers and the community -- an issue that cannot be\n\n\n-----\n\ngame studios. For example, a study from [Michigan State](https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2021/faculty-voice-gaming-and-toxicity)\n\n\n[University](https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2021/faculty-voice-gaming-and-toxicity) revealed that 80% of players recently experienced\n\ntoxicity, and of those, 20% reported leaving the game due to\n\nthese interactions. Similarly, a study from [Tilburg University](https://arno.uvt.nl/show.cgi?fid=145375)\n\nshowed that having a disruptive or toxic encounter in the first\n\nsession of the game led to players being over three times\n\nmore likely to leave the game without returning. Given that\n\nplayer retention is a top priority for many studios, particularly\n\nas game delivery transitions from physical media releases to\n\nlong-lived services, it‚Äôs clear that toxicity must be curbed.\n\nCompounding this issue related to churn, some companies\n\nface challenges related to toxicity early in development,\n\neven before launch. For example, [Amazon‚Äôs Crucible](https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-crucible-release-first-big-videogame/) was\n\nreleased into testing without text or voice chat due in part\n\nto not having a system in place to monitor or manage toxic\n\n\nIn this section, we‚Äôre going to talk about how to use your data\n\nto more effectively find your target audience across the web.\n\nWhether you‚Äôre engaging in paid advertising, influencer or\n\nreferral marketing, PR, cross promotion, community building,\n\netc - use data to separate activity from impact. You want\n\nto focus on the channels and strategies that leverage your\n\nresources most effectively, be that time or money.\n\nSay you have a cohort of highly engaged players who are\n\nspending money on your title, and you want to find more\n\ngamers just like that. Doing an analysis on the demographic\n\nand behavioral data of this cohort will give you the\n\ninformation needed to use an ad platform (such as Meta,\n\nGoogle, or Unity) to do lookalike modeling and target those\n\npotential gamers for acquisition.\n\n\ngamers and interactions. This illustrates that the scale of\n\n\nthe gaming space has far surpassed most teams‚Äô ability to\n\nmanage such behavior through reports or by intervening in\n\ndisruptive interactions. Given this, it‚Äôs essential for studios\n\nto integrate analytics into games early in the development\n\nlifecycle and then design for the ongoing management of\n\ntoxic interactions.\n\n**What we‚Äôre trying to solve/achieve**\n\nToxicity in gaming is clearly a multifaceted issue that\n\nhas become a part of video game culture and cannot be\n\naddressed universally in a single way. That said, addressing\n\ntoxicity within in-game chat can have a huge impact given\n\nthe frequency of toxic behavior and the ability to automate\n\nthe detection of it using natural language processing (NLP). In\n\nsummary, by leveraging machine learning to better identify\n\ndisruptive behavior so that better-informed decisions\n\naround handling actions can be made.\n\n**Get started with Toxicity Detection**\n\n\n##### Multi-Touch Attribution\n\n**Overview**\n\nMulti-touch attribution is a method of attributing credit to\n\ndifferent marketing channels or touchpoints that contribute to\n\na sale or conversion. In other words, it is a way of understanding\n\nhow different marketing efforts influence a customer‚Äôs decision\n\nto make a purchase or take a desired action.\n\nThere are a variety of different attribution models that can\n\nbe used to assign credit to different touchpoints, each with\n\nits own strengths and limitations. For example, the last-\n\nclick model attributes all credit to the last touchpoint that\n\nthe customer interacted with before making a purchase,\n\nwhile the first-click model attributes all credit to the first\n\ntouchpoint. Other models, such as the linear model or\n\nthe time decay model, distribute credit across multiple\n\ntouchpoints based on different algorithms.\n\n**What we‚Äôre trying to solve/achieve**\n\nMulti-touch attribution can be useful for game studios because\n\nit can help them understand which marketing channels or\n\nefforts are most effective at driving conversions and inform their\n\nmarketing strategy. However, it is important to choose the right\n\nattribution model for your title based on your business model\n\n(one-time purchase, subscription, free-to-play, freemium,\n\nin-game advertising, etc.) and regularly review and optimize your\n\nattribution efforts to ensure they are accurate and effective.\n\n**Get started with Multi-Touch Attribution**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Activating Your Playerbase\n\nSo far, we‚Äôve discussed how to better understand your\n\nplayers, and how to acquire more of your target audience.\n\nNext, we‚Äôre going to dig into how to better activate your\n\nplayers to create a more engaged and loyal playerbase that\n\nstays with your game for the long-term. Here, we‚Äôre going to\n\nfocus on strategies that differentiate your gamer experience.\n\n##### Player Recommendations\n\n\nand make in-game purchases. Additionally, personalized\n\nrecommendations can help improve the overall player\n\nexperience and increase satisfaction.\n\nGame studios can use a variety of techniques to create player\n\nrecommendations, such as machine learning algorithms,\n\ncollaborative filtering, and manual curation. It is important\n\nto regularly review and optimize these recommendations to\n\nensure that they are effective and relevant to players.\n\n**Get started with Player Recommendations**\n\n\n**Overview**\n\nPlayer recommendations are suggestions for content or actions\n\n\nthat a game studio makes to individual players based on their\n\ninterests and behaviors. These recommendations can be used\n\nto promote specific in-game items, encourage players to try\n\nnew features, or simply provide a personalized experience.\n\n**What we‚Äôre trying to solve/achieve**\n\nPlayer recommendations matter to game studios because\n\nthey can help improve player retention, engagement, and\n\nmonetization. By providing players with recommendations\n\nthat are relevant and engaging, studios can increase the\n\nlikelihood that players will continue to play their games\n\n\n##### Next Best Offer/Action\n\n**Overview**\n\nNext best offer (NBO) and next best action (NBA) are\n\ntechniques that businesses use to make personalized\n\nrecommendations to their customers. NBO refers to the\n\npractice of recommending the most relevant product or\n\nservice to a customer based on their past purchases and\n\nbehaviors. NBA refers to the practice of recommending the\n\nmost relevant action or interaction to a customer based on\n\nthe same information.\n\n\n-----\n\nin-game purchase to a player based on their past spending\n\nhabits and the items they have shown an interest in. They\n\nmight use NBA to recommend a specific level or event to a\n\nplayer based on their progress and interests.\n\n**What we‚Äôre trying to solve/achieve**\n\nIt‚Äôs important to remember that next best offer is a specific\n\nuse case within personalization that involves making\n\nrecommendations to players on the most valuable in-game\n\nitem or action they should take next. For example, a next\n\nbest offer recommendation in a mobile game might suggest\n\nthat a player purchase a specific in-game currency or unlock\n\na new character.\n\nBoth NBO and NBA can be used to improve customer\n\nretention, engagement, and monetization by providing\n\npersonalized recommendations that are more likely to be\n\nrelevant and appealing to individual customers. They can be\n\nimplemented using a variety of techniques, such as machine\n\nlearning algorithms or manual curation.\n\n**Get started with Next Best Offer/Action**\n\n##### Churn Prediction & Prevention\n\n**Overview**\n\nVideo games live and die by their player base. For Games-\n\n\nmay overwhelm the ability of these players to consume,\n\nreinforcing the overall problem of player churn.\n\nAt some point, it becomes critical for teams to take a cold,\n\nhard look at the cost of acquisition relative to the subscriber\n\nlifetime value (LTV) earned. These figures need to be brought\n\ninto a healthy balance, and retention needs to be actively\n\nmanaged, not as a point-in-time problem to be solved, but\n\nas a ‚Äúchronic condition‚Äù which needs to be managed for the\n\nongoing health of the title.\n\nHeadroom for continued acquisition-driven growth can\n\nbe created by carefully examining why some players leave\n\nand some players stay. When centered on factors known\n\nat the time of acquisition, gaming studios may have the\n\nopportunity to rethink key aspects of their acquisition\n\nstrategy that promote higher average retention rates, which\n\ncan lead to higher average revenue per user.\n\n**Prerequisites for use case**\n\nThis use case assumes a certain level of existing data\n\ncollection infrastructure in the studio. Notably, a studio ready\n\nto implement a churn prediction and prevention model\n\nshould have\n\n-  A cloud environment where player data is stored\n\n-  This source data should contain player behavior and\n\nsession telemetry events from within the game. This is\n\nthe foundation that insights can be built on top of.\n\n\nas-a-Service (GaaS) titles, engagement is the most\n\n\nimportant metric a team can measure. Naturally, proactively\n\npreventing churn is critical to sustained engagement and\n\n\n**Get started with Churn Prediction & Prevention**\n\n\ngrowth. Through churn prediction and prevention, you will\n\n\nbe able to analyze behavioral data to identify subscribers\n\nwith an increased risk of churn. Next, you will use machine\n\nlearning to quantify the likelihood of a subscriber to churn, as\n\nwell as indicate which factors create that risk.\n\n**What we‚Äôre trying to solve/achieve**\n\nBalancing customer acquisition and retention is critical.\n\nThis is the central challenge to the long-term success of\n\nany live service game. This is particularly challenging in that\n\nsuccessful customer acquisition strategies needed to get\n\ngames to scale tend to be followed by service disruptions or\n\ndeclines in quality and customer experience, accelerating\n\nplayer abandonment. To replenish lost subscribers, the\n\nacquisition engine continues to grind and expenses mount.\n\nAs games reach for customers beyond the core playerbase\n\nthey may have initially targeted, the title may not resonate\n\n\n##### Real-time Ad Targeting\n\n**Overview**\n\nReal-time ad targeting in the context of game development\n\nfocuses on using data to deliver personalized and relevant\n\nadvertisements to players in near real-time, while they are\n\nplaying a game. Real-time targeting is performanced based,\n\nusing highly personalized messagings which are achieved\n\nby using data to precisely determine the most opportune\n\nmoments to display ads, based on factors such as player\n\nbehavior, game state, and other contextual information.\n\nKnowing when to send those ads is based on data. This\n\nuse case is specific to titles using in-game advertising as a\n\nbusiness model. It‚Äôs important to note that in-game real-\n\ntime ad targeting requires a sophisticated tech stack, with\n\n\n-----\n\nwith bigger ad ecosystem, ad networks and partners. The\n\nDatabricks Lakehouse platform is an optimal foundation as it\n\nalready contains many of the connectors required to enable\n\nthis use case.\n\n**What we‚Äôre trying to solve/achieve**\n\nThe goal of in-game real-time ad targeting is to provide a\n\nmore immersive and relevant advertising experience for\n\nplayers, while also increasing the effectiveness of the ads\n\nfor advertisers. By delivering targeted ads that are relevant\n\nto each player‚Äôs interests, game developers can create a\n\nmore enjoyable and personalized gaming experience, which\n\ncan help to reduce churn and increase the lifetime value of\n\neach player. Additionally, real-time ad targeting can also help\n\ngame developers monetize their games more effectively, as\n\nadvertisers are willing to pay a premium for hyper-targeted\n\nand engaged audiences.\n\n**Get started with Real-time Ad Targeting**\n\n### Operational use cases\n\nIn the game development industry, operational analytics\n\n\n**Overview**\n\nAnomaly detection plays an important role in the operation\n\nof a live service video game by helping to identify and\n\ndiagnose unexpected behaviors in real-time. By identifying\n\npatterns and anomalies in player behavior, system\n\nperformance, and network traffic, this information can then\n\nbe used to detect and diagnose server crashes, performance\n\nbottlenecks, and hacking attempts. The ability to understand\n\nif there will be an issue before it becomes widespread is\n\nimmensely valuable. Without anomaly detection, which is\n\na form of advanced analytics, you‚Äôre always in a reactive\n\n(rather than proactive) state. Anomaly detection is a type of\n\nquality of service solution.\n\n**What we‚Äôre trying to solve/achieve**\n\nThe goal of anomaly detection is to ensure that players\n\nhave a stable and enjoyable gaming experience. This has\n\nan impact across your game, from reducing downtime,\n\nto minimizing player churn, and improving your game‚Äôs\n\nreputation and revenue. Additionally, the insights gained from\n\nanomaly detection can also be used to mitigate cheating and\n\ndisruptive behavior.\n\n**Get started with Anomaly Detection**\n\n\nare essential for ensuring a smooth and efficient production\n\n\nprocess. One common use case is anomaly detection, where\n\ndata analytics is utilized to identify any unusual patterns\n\nor behaviors in the game, such as crashes or performance\n\nissues. This helps developers quickly identify and fix\n\nproblems, improving the overall quality of the game. Another\n\nexample is build pipelines, where data analytics can be used\n\nto monitor and optimize the process of creating new builds\n\nof the game. By tracking key metrics such as build time,\n\nerror rates, and resource utilization, developers can make\n\ninformed decisions about how to optimize the build process\n\nfor maximum efficiency. Other operational use cases in game\n\ndevelopment include tracking player behavior, measuring\n\nserver performance, and analyzing sales and marketing data.\n\nLets explore a few of these below.\n\n\n##### Build Pipeline\n\n**Overview**\n\nA build pipeline is a set of automated processes that\n\nare used to compile and assemble the code, assets, and\n\nresources that make up a game project. The build pipeline\n\ntypically includes several stages, such as code compilation,\n\noptimization, testing, and release. The purpose of a build\n\npipeline is to streamline the game development process\n\nand ensure that each stage of development is completed\n\nefficiently and effectively. A build pipeline can be configured\n\nto run automatically, so that new builds are generated\n\nwhenever changes are made to the code or assets. This\n\nhelps to ensure that the game is always up-to-date and\n\nready for testing and release. The logs are collected are in\n\nnear-real time from build servers. A simplified example:Dev\n\nX is committing code on title Y, submitted on day Z,\n\nalong with the log files from the pipeline and build server.\n\nBuilds typically take multiple hours to complete, requiring\n\nsignificant amounts of compute via build farms. Being able to\n\n\n-----\n\nare wasting compute, and being able to predict which builds\n\nwill fail as they goes through the pipeline are ways to curb\n\noperational expenses.\n\n**What we‚Äôre trying to solve/achieve**\n\nWith this use case, we‚Äôre seeking to reduce wasted compute\n\nand build a foundational view of what was developed, by\n\nwho, when and how testing performed. In an ideal state, our\n\nautomated build pipeline could send a notification to the\n\ndeveloper with a confidence metric on the build making it\n\nthrough, allowing them to decide whether to continue or\n\nmove another build through the pipeline. Often, developers\n\ndo not have clear visibility until the build has completed\n\nor failed. By providing more insight to devs into the build\n\npipeline process, we can increase the rate at which builds\n\nare completed efficiently and effectively.\n\n**Get started with Build Pipeline**\n\n##### Crash Analytics\n\n\nresources were being used. How long crash testing takes\n\ncan vary, depending on the game‚Äôs business model, amount\n\nof content, and scope. For a title with a one-time release,\n\nwhere there is a large amount of content and a complex\n\nstoryline, the chances of hidden crashes causing errors while\n\nin development are high, making it require more time to\n\nperform testing before the game can be published. For titles\n\nbuilt in a game-as-a-service model, i.e. a game shipped in\n\ncycles of constant iteration, crash detection should be done\n\ncontinuously, since errors in newly released content might\n\naffect the base game and lead to crashes.\n\nIncreasingly, titles are being released in alpha (where\n\ndevelopers do the testing), closed beta (which includes a\n\nlimited group of testers/sample-users who do the gameplay\n\ntesting) and open betas (where anyone interested can register\n\nto try the game). All of which happens before the game is\n\n‚Äúofficially‚Äù released. Regardless of alpha, beta, or GA, players\n\nmay stumble over game crashes, which triggers crash reports\n\nthat are sent to the developers for fixing. But sometimes, it\n\ncan be challenging to understand the issue that caused the\n\ncrash from crash reports provided by your game‚Äôs platform.\n\n**What we‚Äôre trying to solve/achieve**\n\nUltimately, the purpose of crash analytics is to identify the\n\nroot cause of a crash, and help you take steps to prevent\n\nsimilar crashes from happening in the future. This feedback\n\nloop can be tightened through automation in the data\n\npipeline. For example, by tracking crashes caused on builds\n\nfrom committers, the data can provide build suggestions\n\nto improve crash rate. Furthermore, teams can automate\n\ndeduplication when multiple players experience the same\n\nerrors, helping to reduce noise in the alerts received.\n\n**Get started with Crash Analytics**\n\n\n**Overview**\n\nGames crash, it is a fact of game development. The\n\ncombination of drivers, hardware, software, and\n\nconfigurations create unique challenges in tracking, resolving\n\nand managing the user experience.\n\nCrash analytics and reporting is the process of collecting\n\ninformation about crashes or unexpected failures in a\n\nsoftware application, in this case, a video game. A crash\n\nreport typically includes information about the state of the\n\ngame at the time of the crash, such as what the player was\n\n\n-----\n\n# Things to look forward to\n\n\nThis eBook was created to help game developers better\n\nwrap their heads around the general concepts in which data,\n\nanalytics, and AI can be used to support the development\n\nand growth of video games. **If you only have 5 minutes,**\n\n**these takeaways are critical to your success** .\n\nFor more information on advanced data, analytics, and AI use\n\ncases, as well as education resources, we highly recommend\n\nDatabricks training portal [dbricks.co/training](http://dbricks.co/training) .\n\n**Top takeaways:**\n\nIf you take nothing else from this guide, here are the most\n\nimportant takeaways we want to leave with you on your journey.\n\n`1.` **Data is fundamental. Data, analytics, and AI play a role**\n\nthroughout the entire game development lifecycle - from\n\ndiscovery to pre-production, development to operating\n\na game as a live service. Build better games, cultivate\n\ndeeper player engagements, and operate more effectively\n\n\nby utilizing the full potential of your data.\n\n`2.` **Define your goals.** Start by establishing the goals of what\n\nyou‚Äôre hoping to learn and or understand around your\n\ngame. Clear goals make it easier to identify key metrics\n\nto track, example goals include; developing high-quality\n\ngames that provide engaging and satisfying player\n\nexperiences, increasing player engagement and retention\n\nby analyzing and improving gameplay and mechanics, and\n\nbuilding a strong and positive brand reputation through\n\neffective marketing and community outreach.\n\n`3.` **Identify and understand your data sources.** Spend time\n\nto identify and understand the breadth of data sources\n\nyou are already collecting, be that game telemetry,\n\nmarketplace, game services, or sources beyond the game\n\nlike social media. It is critical to collect the right data, and\n\ntrack the right metrics based on the goals and objectives\n\nyou have set for your game.\n\n`4.` **Start small, and iterate quickly.** Recognize that goals and\n\nobjectives evolve as you learn more about the interaction\n\n\n-----\n\nare most effective when scoped small with tight feedback\n\nloops, allowing you to quickly adapt with your community\n\nand alongside shifting market conditions.\n\n`5.` **Game analytics forms the foundation.** Start by getting a\n\ngame analytics dashboard up and running. The process of\n\nbuilding out a dashboard will naturally require connecting\n\nand transforming your data in a way to unlock more\n\nadvanced use cases down the road.\n\n`6.` **Plan and revisit your data strategy frequently.** Once\n\ndashboarding is set up, you‚Äôll have a better picture of what\n\ndownstream data use cases make the most sense for\n\nyour game and business objectives. As you move to use\n\ncases such as player segmentation, churn analysis, and\n\nplayer lifetime value, revisit your data strategy frequently\n\nto ensure you‚Äôre spending time on use cases that drive\n\nactionable insights for you and your team.\n\n`7.` **Show value broad and wide.** Whether your data strategy\n\nis new or well established on the team, build the habit\n\nof communicating broadly to stakeholders across the\n\ncompany. Early in the process, it is important to gather\n\ncritical feedback on what data is helpful and where there\n\nare opportunities for improvement. The worst thing that\n\ncan happen is you create something that no one uses.\n\nThat is a waste of everyone‚Äôs time and money.\n\n`8.` **Ask for help.** Engage with your technical partners. There\n\nare humans who can help ensure you‚Äôre developing your\n\ndata and analytics platform in a way that is efficient and\n\neffective.

Having clear goals will help you focus on\n\ncollecting the right data and making meaningful use of it.\n\n-  **Plan your data collection:** Determine what data you need\n\nto collect, how you will collect it, and how you will store it.\n\n-  **Consider privacy:** Make sure you are transparent with your\n\nplayers about what data you are collecting and how you\n\nwill use it, and give them the option to opt out if they wish.\n\n-  **Use analytics to inform design:** Leverage your analytics data\n\nto inform decisions around game design, such as any balance\n\nchanges or new content targeting a specific audience.\n\n-  **Monitor and test your analytics implementation:** Regularly\n\ncheck your analytics to ensure that data is being collected\n\ncorrectly, and conduct tests to validate the accuracy of\n\nyour data.\n\n-  **Visualize your data:** Dashboarding your data is one of the\n\nmost effective ways to quickly and effectively make sense\n\nof what‚Äôs happening at a given moment in time.\n\n-  **Use data to improve player retention:** Analyze player\n\nbehavior and use the insights you gain to improve player\n\nretention, such as by identifying and addressing pain\n\npoints or by providing personalized content.\n\n-  **Collaborate with your team:** Share your analytics\n\nfindings with your team and encourage them to use the\n\ndata to inform their work.\n\n-  **Keep it simple:** Don‚Äôt try to collect too much data or\n\ncreate overly complex analytics systems. Keep it simple\n\nand focused on your goals.\n\n-  **Start where you are:** If you‚Äôve yet to gather all of your\n\ndata, don‚Äôt go build some fancy model. Start with the data\n\nyou have available to you and build from there.\n\n### Getting started with  Player Segmentation\n\nPlayer segmentation is crucial to studios as it allows them\n\nto better understand their audience and tailor their game\n\nexperience to meet their specific needs and preferences.\n\nBy dividing players into different segments based on factors\n\nsuch as demographics, playing styles, and in-game behavior,\n\n\n-----\n\nstudios can gain valuable insights into what motivates and\n\nengages their players. This information can then be used\n\nto design games that not only provide a more enjoyable\n\nexperience for players, but also drive player retention\n\nand increase revenue for the studio. In a competitive\n\nindustry where player satisfaction is key to success, player\n\nsegmentation is an essential tool for studios to stay ahead of\n\nthe game.\n\nStart by evaluating the segmentation goals such as:\n\n-  **Personalize the experience:** Changing or creating\n\nexperience specific designs to the player.\n\n-  **Create relevant content:** Surface the best content to\n\nplayers based on features and behaviors that will matter\n\nthe most depending on the player‚Äôs place in the games\n\nlife cycle.\n\n-  **Monetization:** Create tailored monetization strategies\n\nthat effectively reach and convert each player group. For\n\nexample, you may have a group of highly engaged players\n\nwho are more likely to make in-app purchases, while\n\nanother group is less likely to spend money but may be\n\nmore receptive to advertisements.\n\nThe next steps would be to identify, collect and analyze\n\nplayer data. By gathering information on player behavior,\n\npreferences, and demographics, you can gain insights\n\ninto their motivations, pain points, and what drives their\n\nengagement with your game.\n\nThere are multiple types of player data to collect, including:\n\n-  **Player Behavior:** Track player behavior and actions\n\nwithin your game to gain insights into their play style,\n\npreferences, and patterns.\n\n-  **Surveys:** Ask players directly about their preferences,\n\nmotivations, and feedback through in-game surveys, email\n\nquestionnaires, or other forms of direct communication.\n\n-  **Focus groups:** Gather a small group of players to discuss\n\nand provide feedback on specific aspects of your game\n\nand player experience.\n\n-  **Social media listening:** Monitor social media platforms\n\nto gather insights into how players are engaging with and\n\ntalking about your game.\n\n**[Customer Segmentation solution accelerator](https://www.databricks.com/solutions/accelerators/customer-segmentation)**\n\n\n**Tips / Best Practices**\n\nDefine your segmentation goals: Determine what you want\n\nto learn about your players and why. This will help you focus\n\nyour analysis and ensure that your segments are meaningful\n\nand actionable.\n\n-  **Use meaningful criteria:** Choose criteria that are relevant\n\nto your goals and that differentiate players in meaningful\n\nways. This could include demographic information, in-game\n\nbehavior, spending habits, or a combination of factors.\n\n-  **Analyze player data:** Use data from your players to inform\n\nyour segmentation strategy. This could include data\n\non in-game behavior, spending habits, or demographic\n\ninformation.\n\n-  **Use multiple methods:** We recommend using a\n\ncombination of methods, such as clustering to create\n\nsegments that are statistically meaningful and actionable\n\nto your game.\n\n-  **Validate your segments:** Test your segments to ensure\n\nthat they accurately reflect the differences you observed\n\nin your player data. This could involve comparing the\n\nsegments to each other, or validating the segments\n\nagainst external data sources.\n\n-  **Consider ethical and privacy concerns:** Ensure that\n\nyour segmentation strategy is ethical and complies\n\nwith privacy laws and regulations. This could involve\n\nanonymizing your player data, obtaining consent from\n\nplayers, or other measures to protect player privacy.\n\n-  **Monitor and refine your segments:** Regularly review\n\nyour segments to ensure that they remain relevant and\n\nmeaningful. Refine your segments as necessary to reflect\n\nchanges in your player data or your goals.\n\n### Getting Started with  Player Lifetime Value\n\nAssuming you‚Äôve followed the steps to collecting, storing, and\n\npreparing your player data for analysis; To calculate player\n\nlifetime value (LTV), the quick and dirty way of assessing\n\noverall player LTV is to divide the total revenue by the total\n\nnumber of registered players. Note, LTV is a critical calculation\n\nfor return on investment, which is player lifetime spend versus\n\nthe amount spent on player acquisition. Ideally, you want\n\nlifetime spend to be equal to or more than cost of acquisition.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs long as your game and its community are currently active,\n\nany player lifetime value calculations should be considered\n\nmodels, not exact numbers. This is because many of the players\n\nyou‚Äôre considering are likely actively registered and actively\n\nplaying, so the exact player LTV number is a moving target.\n\nAdvanced\npredictive\nmodels\n\nSimple\npredictive\nmodels\n\n\nHistorical\naverage and\nbenchmarks\n\n\nBut these models are not entirely accurate since it doesn‚Äôt\n\ntake into account the players who are registered but have\n\nyet to generate any revenue. Instead, a data-driven approach\n\npivoted around player segmentation or cohorts will generally\n\nyield more actionable insight, far more than calculating a\n\nsingle LTV for the entire player base.\n\nYou can define your game‚Äôs cohorts in multiple ways. Perhaps\n\nthe most obvious in terms of calculating LTV is going by daily\n\nactive cohorts, or users who joined your game on the same\n\nday. You could also organize cohorts by users who joined\n\nyour game through a certain ad campaign or promotional\n\neffort, by country or geographic location, or by the type of\n\ndevice used.\n\n**[Lifetime Value solution accelerator](https://www.databricks.com/solutions/accelerators/customer-lifetime-value)**\n\n\n**ACCURACY**\n\n**Tips / Best Practices**\n\n\n**Use multiple data sources:** To get a complete picture of\n\na player‚Äôs value, be sure to consider data from a variety\n\nof sources, including in-game purchases, ad revenue, and\n\nother monetization strategies.\n\n**Consider player retention:** Player retention is a key factor\n\nin LTV, so be sure to consider how long players are likely to\n\nplay your game when calculating LTV.\n\n**Use accurate data:** Make sure you are using accurate\n\ndata when calculating LTV. This might involve cleaning and\n\nprocessing your data, or using trusted sources such as in-\n\ngame analytics tools.\n\n**Regularly review and update your LTV estimates:** Player\n\nLTV can change over time, so be sure to regularly review\n\nand update your estimates to ensure they are accurate.\n\n**Test and optimize:** Use experimentation methods such\n\nas A/B testing to see how different variables, such as\n\nin-game events or pricing strategies, affect LTV. Use the\n\ninsights you gain to optimize your LTV calculations.\n\n**Be aware of outside factors:** Your calculations should\n\nconsider the many outside factors that can affect your\n\nLTV, such as the virality of your game, any spikes or surge\n\nin visitors due to unexpected promotions (influencers,\n\nreviewers talking about your game), any significant changes\n\nto your game that users respond well to, and other organic\n\nlifts that are difficult to predict with existing data.\n\n\nThe first calculation is relatively simple. We suggest using\n\naverage revenue per user (ARPU), which is a game‚Äôs daily\n\nrevenue divided by the number of active users, to help you\n\ncalculate lifetime value. First, you‚Äôll need to define what is\n\nan active player using retention values; which can be set to\n\na week, multi-day, or multi-week period of time depending\n\non how your game has performed to date. You can then look\n\nat the number of users who churn on a given day, averaging\n\nwith the number of days from the player‚Äôs first visit to the\n\ncurrent date (or the specific date you‚Äôve considered the end\n\nfor said exercise). This is your playerbase lifetime value (note\n\nnot Player Lifetime Value). To get Lifetime Value, divide daily\n\nrevenue by the number of daily active users, and multiply\n\nthat by the Lifetime Value to get your player LTV.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to note that while calculating player lifetime\n\nvalue, the term is not entirely accurate since most player\n\nlifetimes are not over (particularly true for live service\n\ngames). But for the purpose of modeling, we recommend\n\nkeeping the amount of time that you consider a lifetime\n\nrelatively short, allowing you to extrapolate. Keeping the time\n\nperiod shorter helps mitigate inaccuracies, specifically, the\n\nlonger you stretch out what you consider a lifetime the more\n\nlikely you are to collect inactive users in your count.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Getting Started with  Social Media Monitoring\n\nSocial media monitoring has three primary components:\n\ncollecting the data, processing the results, and taking action\n\non the findings. When it comes to collecting the data, whether\n\nyou‚Äôre looking for tweets, YouTube comments, or Reddit\n\nposts, it can be very easy to get started since many social\n\nmedia platforms such as Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit all\n\nprovide their own detailed and comprehensive APIs making it\n\neasy to start gathering data from those platforms with proper\n\ndocumentation and code examples to help along the way.\n\nOnce the data has been collected, the next step is to process\n\nit and prepare it to be used in the next step. Processing your\n\ndata can range in complexity from a simple keywords filter\n\nor more complicated approach such as filtering by location,\n\nremoving emojis, and censoring and substituting words. With\n\nthe data collected and processed, it can move to the final\n\nstage and be analyzed for downstream use and actionable\n\ninsights by applying sentiment analysis or text mining.\n\nIf a game studio is looking to save time and have the above\n\nsteps performed for them, it may be appealing to buy a\n\npre-built tool. The primary benefits of buying an off the shelf\n\nsolution is that it is often faster and easier to get started\n\nwith, and the development of the tool is handled by a third\n\nparty who will have experience in building media monitoring\n\n\nsolutions. On the other hand, building your own custom\n\nsolution will provide more flexibility and control. Many pre-\n\nbuilt media monitoring tools might not have the capabilities\n\nrequired to effectively process video, audio, and image\n\ndata, and may not be able to control the frequency in which\n\ndata is processed, whether it be near real-time or batch.\n\nAdditionally, pre-built solutions tend to take a generalist\n\napproach for NLP, whether it be keyword extraction, topic\n\nfiltering, or sentiment analysis, which often leads to poor\n\nresults and feedback, especially for an industry as unique as\n\nthe gaming industry where certain industry-specific slang\n\nor terminology is frequently used. Overall, building your\n\nown media monitoring tool will provide greater control and\n\nflexibility leading to a better tailored return on investment,\n\nand luckily Databricks makes it even easier to get started.\n\nWith the Databricks Lakehouse platform, all data engineering,\n\ndata science, machine learning, and data analytics can\n\nbe done in a single place without having to stitch multiple\n\nsystems and tools together.\n\nData engineers can use Workflows and Jobs to call social\n\nmedia platform APIs on a scheduled basis and use Delta Live\n\nTables to create declarative data pipelines for cleaning and\n\nprocessing the data that comes in. Data scientists can use\n\ntools such as ML-specific Databricks runtimes (DBRs) that\n\ncome with many of the most popular and common libraries\n\nalready installed, MLflow which makes model development,\n\n\n-----\n\ntracking, and serving easy and efficient, and various other\n\ntools such as AutoML and Bamboolib. Data analysts are able\n\nto create real-time alerts, dashboards, and visualizations\n\nusing Databricks SQL. Each of the three personas will be able\n\nto effectively collaborate with each other and integrate each\n\npiece of their work into the broader data architecture.\n\nIf you have any questions about how this solution can be\n\ndeployed in your environment, please don‚Äôt hesitate to [reach](https://databricks.com/company/contact)\n\n[out](https://databricks.com/company/contact) to us.\n\n**Tips / Best Practices**\n\nWhile social media monitoring can be easy to get started\n\nwith, there are a few key points to keep in mind.\n\n-  Remember the Pareto principle (roughly 80% of impact\n\ncomes from 20% of activity) and diminishing returns. While\n\nit‚Äôs important to monitor large platforms such as Reddit,\n\nTwitter, and YouTube, it might not be worthwhile to monitor\n\nsmaller platforms (in terms of engagement) as the bulk of\n\ncustomer feedback will be on those major platforms.\n\n-  Monitor other sources of information. It is also useful to\n\nmonitor mentions of key company personnel such as\n\nexecutives or public facing employees.\n\n-  While follower count does matter on platforms such as\n\nTwitter, don‚Äôt ignore users with low-follower counts. It only\n\ntakes one or two re-tweets from other users to become a\n\nlarge issue.\n\n-  On social media, customers can see through generic\n\ncorporate responses to complaints, so it is important\n\nto get a clear understanding of the issue and provide a\n\nclear response.\n\n### Getting Started with  Player Feedback Analysis\n\nThe easiest place to start is gathering your data. With\n\naccounts set up on Steam, Epic, Apple, Google, Xbox, Sony,\n\nNintendo (or whatever platform you‚Äôre using), identify the ID\n\nfor your game(s), and pull the reviews corresponding to that\n\ngame into Databricks through an API call.\n\n\nFrom here, you clean the data using some of the pre-\n\nprocessing available in Python that removes any emojis and\n\nASCII characters. Once complete, run through Spark NLP\n\npipeline which does the basic natural language processing\n\nsteps such as normalization, stemming, lemmatization. We\n\nrecommend running through pre-trained models, such as Word\n\nEmbeddings and Named Entity Recognition models from John\n\nSnow Labs. This should complete the pipeline and generates\n\nthe aspects for the reviews provided by the community.\n\nThis data is then loaded into a Delta table for further analysis,\n\nsuch as using a visual dashboard (built on SQL queries inside\n\nDatabricks) to analyze and understand the aspects the\n\ncommunity is talking about, which can then be shared back\n\nwith the development team for analysis and action. This is a\n\ngreat exercise to run once per month.\n\nIf you have any questions about how this solution can be\n\ndeployed in your environment, please don‚Äôt hesitate to [reach](https://www.databricks.com/company/contact)\n\n[out](https://www.databricks.com/company/contact) to us.\n\n**Tips / Best Practices**\n\n-  **Check for word groupings:** Make sure your word groupings\n\nare accurate to improve the analysis. For example, if your\n\ngame is called Football Manager, and the shorthand is FM,\n\nmake sure both of those are grouped appropriately.\n\n-  **Leverage domain knowledge:** Clean the reviews based\n\non your domain knowledge. There are generic steps one\n\ncould take, but that will not be as effective as someone\n\nwith domain, and specific game knowledge of your title.\n\n-  **Experiment with models:** Feel free to try multiple pre-\n\ntrained models, and or tweak the pre-trained models\n\nbased on your understanding of the domain to improve\n\nthe accuracy of your results.\n\n-  **Work one title at a time:** This process works best when\n\npulling reviews for a single title, specifically one version of\n\none title at a time.\n\n-  **Let the model to the heavy lift, but use humans to double-**\n\n**check:** The sentiment corresponding to the aspects in the\n\nmodel will be labeled as Positive or Negative. In the case\n\nof a neutral review, the model will do its best to determine\n\nwhether that is more positive or negative. A best practice\n\nis to spend time going back through the aspects early to\n\ndetermine model accuracy and make updates accordingly.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Getting Started with  Toxicity Detection\n\nOur recommendation on tackling the toxicity issue is\n\nto leverage cloud-agnostic and flexible tooling that can\n\nconsume chat data from a variety of sources, such as chat\n\nlogs, voice transcriptions, or sources like discord and reddit\n\nforums. No matter if the data is in log form from game\n\nservers or events from a message system, Databricks can\n\nprovide quick and easy ways to ingest the data.\n\nLeveraging a simplified architecture like the diagram\n\nabove shows no matter the source, getting chat data for\n\ninferencing and model development can be as simple. While\n\nwe leveraged a pre-built model from John Snow Labs to\n\naccelerate development, you can bring the ML framework of\n\nyour choice to the platform.\n\n**[Gaming Toxicity solution accelerator](https://notebooks.databricks.com/notebooks/CME/Toxicity_Detection_in_Gaming/index.html)**\n\n\n**Tips / Best Practices - things to consider**\n\n-  **Define what toxic and disruptive behavior looks**\n\n**like within your community:** Clearly define what you\n\nconsider to be toxic behavior, as this will determine how\n\nyou measure and detect it. This might include things like\n\nhateful language, harassment, or cheating.\n\n-  **Collect relevant data:** Make sure you are collecting the\n\nright data to help you detect toxicity. This might include\n\ndata on in-game chat, player reports, and other sources.\n\n-  **Use machine learning:** Use machine learning algorithms\n\nto analyze your data and identify patterns of toxic\n\nbehavior. This will allow you to more accurately detect\n\ntoxicity and prioritize cases for review.\n\n-  **Test and optimize:** Regularly review and test your toxicity\n\ndetection systems to ensure they are accurate and\n\neffective. Use experimentation methods such as A/B\n\ntesting to see how different strategies impact toxicity rates.\n\n-  **Be transparent:** Make sure you are transparent with your\n\nplayers about how you are detecting toxicity, and give\n\nthem the option to opt out if they wish.\n\n-  **Take action:** When toxic behavior is detected, take\n\nappropriate action to address it. The health and wellness\n\nof your community depends on it. This might involve\n\nbanning players, issuing warnings, or taking other\n\ndisciplinary measures.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Getting Started with  Multi-Touch Attribution  and Media Mix Modeling\n\nTo get started with multi-touch attribution, you need to first\n\nselect an attribution model. There are a variety of different\n\nattribution models to choose from, each with its own\n\n\nattribution credit according to your chosen model (above).\n\nWe highly recommend you regularly review and test your\n\nattribution efforts to ensure they are accurate and effective.\n\nUse experimentation methods such as A/B testing to see\n\nhow different strategies impact conversion rates.\n\n**[Multi-Touch Attribution solution accelerator](https://notebooks.databricks.com/notebooks/CME/Multi-touch_Attribution/index.html#Multi-touch_Attribution_1.html)**\n\n\nstrengths and limitations.\n\n\n`1.` **Last-click model:** This model attributes all credit to the\n\nlast touchpoint that the customer interacted with before\n\nmaking a purchase or taking a desired action.\n\n`2.` **First-click model:** This model attributes all credit to the\n\nfirst touchpoint that the customer interacted with.\n\n`3.` **Linear model:** This model attributes equal credit to each\n\ntouchpoint that the customer interacted with.\n\n`4.` **Time decay model:** This model attributes more credit to\n\ntouchpoints that are closer in time to the purchase\n\nor desired action.\n\n`5.` **Position-based model:** This model attributes a portion of\n\nthe credit to the first and last touchpoints, and the remainder\n\nis distributed evenly among the other touchpoints.\n\n`6.` **Custom model:** Some businesses create their own\n\nattribution model based on specific business needs or goals.\n\nEach attribution model has its own strengths and limitations,\n\nand the right model for a particular video game will depend\n\non a variety of factors, including the goals of your title, the\n\ncustomer journey, and the types of marketing channels being\n\nused. It is important to carefully consider the pros and cons\n\nof each model and choose the one that best aligns with the\n\nneeds of your game.\n\nNext, you‚Äôre going to want to set up tracking. In order to\n\nattribute credit to different touchpoints, you‚Äôll need to set up\n\ntracking to capture data on customer interactions. This might\n\ninvolve integrating tracking code into the game, or using a\n\nthird-party tracking tool.\n\nWith tracking set up, you‚Äôll start collecting data on player\n\ninteractions and be able to use that information to calculate\n\n\n**Tips / Best Practices - things to consider**\n\n-  **Define clear goals:** Sounds simple, but by clearly defining\n\nthe goals of your acquisition campaign and what success\n\nlooks like, you will be able to guide your decision-making\n\nand ensure that you are measuring the right metrics -\n\nsuch as cost per install, return on ad spend, conversion\n\nrate, lifetime value, retention rate, and more.\n\n-  **Use a data-driven approach:** Use data to inform your\n\ndecision-making. Collect data on all touchpoints in the\n\nplayer journey, including ad impressions, clicks, installs,\n\nand in-game actions.\n\n-  **Choose the right attribution model:** Select the right\n\nattribution model that accurately reflects the player\n\njourney for your specific genre of game. This can be a\n\ncomplex process. A couple of things to keep in mind\n\n-  Consider the touchpoints that are most important for\n\nyour player journey, such as first ad impression, first\n\nclick, or first in-game action\n\n-  Consider the business goals you‚Äôre trying to achieve.\n\nFor example, if you are focused on maximizing return\n\non investment, a last-click attribution model may be\n\nmost appropriate. On the other hand, if you are looking\n\nto understand the impact of each touchpoint, a multi-\n\ntouch attribution model may be more appropriate.\n\n-  Consider the data you have available, including ad\n\nimpressions, clicks, installs, and in-game actions.\n\n-  **Continuously monitor and optimize:** Continuously\n\nmonitor and optimize your acquisition campaigns based on\n\nthe data. Test different approaches, make adjustments as\n\nneeded, and use A/B testing to determine what works best.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Getting Started with  Player Recommendations\n\nRecommendations is an advanced use case. We don‚Äôt\n\nrecommend (hehe) that you start here, instead, we‚Äôre\n\nassuming that you‚Äôve done the work to set up your game\n\nanalytics (collecting, cleaning, and preparing data for analysis)\n\nand that you‚Äôve done basic segmentation to place your\n\nplayers in cohorts based on their interests and behaviors.\n\nRecommendations can come in many forms for video games.\n\nFor this context, we‚Äôre going to focus on the wide-and-deep\n\nlearning for recommender systems, which has the ability\n\nto both memorize and generalize recommendations based\n\non player behavior and interactions. First [introduced by](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07792)\n\n[Google](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07792) for use in its Google Play app store, the wide-and-\n\ndeep machine learning (ML) model has become popular in a\n\nvariety of online scenarios for its ability to personalize user\n\nengagements, even in ‚Äòcold start problem‚Äô scenarios with\n\nsparse data inputs.\n\nThe goal with wide-and-deep recommenders is to provide\n\n\n**Understanding the model design**\n\nTo understand the concept of wide-and-deep recommend¬≠\n\nations, it‚Äôs best to think of it as two separate, but collaborating,\n\nengines. The wide model, often referred to in the literature as\n\nthe linear model, memorizes users and their past choices. Its\n\ninputs may consist simply of a user identifier and a product\n\nidentifier, though other attributes relevant to the pattern (such\n\nas time of day) may also be incorporated.\n\nThe deep portion of the model, so named as it is a deep\n\nneural network, examines the generalizable attributes of a\n\nuser and their choices. From these, the model learns the\n\nbroader characteristics that tend to favor user selections.\n\nTogether, the wide-and-deep submodels are trained\n\non historical product selections by individual users to\n\npredict future selections. The end result is a single model\n\ncapable of calculating the probability with which a user will\n\npurchase a given item, given both memorized past choices\n\nand generalizations about a user‚Äôs preferences. These\n\nprobabilities form the basis for user-specific rankings, which\n\ncan be used for making recommendations.\n\n\nan intimate level of player understanding. This model uses\n\n\nexplicit and implicit feedback to expand the considerations\n\nset for players. Wide-and-deep recommenders go beyond\n\nsimple weighted averaging of player feedback found in some\n\ncollaborative filters to balance what is understood about\n\nthe individual with what is known about similar gamers. If\n\ndone properly, the recommendations make the gamer feel\n\nunderstood (by your title) and this should translate into\n\ngreater value for both the player and you as the business.\n\n\n**Building the model**\n\nThe intuitive logic of the wide-and-deep recommender\n\nbelies the complexity of its actual construction. Inputs\n\nmust be defined separately for each of the wide-and-\n\ndeep portions of the model and each must be trained in a\n\ncoordinated manner to arrive at a single output, but tuned\n\nusing optimizers specific to the nature of each submodel.\n\nThankfully, the [Tensorflow DNNLinearCombinedClassifier](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/estimator/DNNLinearCombinedClassifier)\n\n[estimator](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/estimator/DNNLinearCombinedClassifier) provides a pre-packaged architecture, greatly\n\nsimplifying the assembly of an overall model.\n\n\n**User A**\n\n-  user identity\n\n-  user attributes\n\n**Product B**\n\n\n**Wide**\n**Sub-Model**\n\n\n**Probability of**\n\n**User A + Product B**\n\n**Wide & Deep**\n**Model**\n\n\n**Deep**\n**Sub-Model**\n\n\n\n-  product identity\n\n-  product attributes\n\n\n-----\n\n**Training**\n\nThe challenge for most teams is then training the\n\nrecommender on the large number of user-product\n\ncombinations found within their data. Using [Petastorm](https://petastorm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) , an\n\nopen-source library for serving large datasets assembled in\n\nApache Spark‚Ñ¢ to Tensorflow (and other ML libraries), one can\n\ncache the data on high-speed, temporary storage and then\n\nread that data in manageable increments to the model during\n\ntraining. In doing so, we limit the memory overhead associated\n\nwith the training exercise while preserving performance.\n\n**Tuning**\n\nTuning the model becomes the next challenge. Various model\n\nparameters control its ability to arrive at an optimal solution.\n\nThe most efficient way to work through the potential parameter\n\ncombinations is simply to iterate through some number of\n\ntraining cycles, comparing the models‚Äô evaluation metrics with\n\neach run to identify the ideal parameter combinations. By\n\ntrials, we can parallelize this work across many compute nodes,\n\nallowing the optimizations to be performed in a timely manner.\n\n**Deploying**\n\nFinally, we need to deploy the model for integration with\n\nvarious retail applications. Leveraging [MLflow](https://www.mlflow.org/) allows us\n\nto both persist our model and package it for deployment\n\nacross a wide variety of microservices layers, including\n\nAzure Machine Learning, AWS Sagemaker, Kubernetes and\n\nDatabricks Model Serving.\n\nWhile this seems like a large number of technologies to bring\n\ntogether just to build a single model, Databricks integrates all\n\nof these technologies within a single platform, providing data\n\nscientists, data engineers & [MLOps](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/mlops) Engineers a unified exper¬≠\n\nience. The pre-integration of these technologies means various\n\nper¬≠sonas can work faster and leverage additional capabilities,\n\nsuch as the [automated tracking](https://docs.databricks.com/machine-learning/automl-hyperparam-tuning/index.html#automated-mlflow-tracking) of models, to enhance the\n\ntransparency of the organization‚Äôs model building efforts.\n\nTo see an end-to-end example of how a wide and deep\n\nrecommender model may be built on Databricks, please\n\ncheck out the following notebooks: [Get the notebook](https://d1r5llqwmkrl74.cloudfront.net/notebooks/RCG/Wide_and_Deep/index.html#Wide_and_Deep_1.html)\n\n**[Recommendation Engines solution accelerator](https://www.databricks.com/solutions/accelerators/recommendation-engines)**\n\n\n**Tips / Best Practices - things to consider**\n\n-  **Use data to inform recommendations:** Use data from\n\nyour analytics, player feedback, and other sources to\n\nunderstand what players like and dislike. This will help\n\nyou create recommendations that are more likely to be\n\nrelevant and engaging for individual players.\n\n-  **Segment your players:** Consider segmenting your players\n\nbased on characteristics such as playstyle, spending\n\nhabits, and demographic information. This will allow you\n\nto create more targeted recommendations for different\n\ngroups of players.\n\n-  **Consider the player‚Äôs current context:** When creating\n\nrecommendations, consider the player‚Äôs current context,\n\nsuch as what they are doing in the game and what\n\ncontent they have already consumed. This will help\n\nyou create recommendations that are more likely to be\n\nrelevant and timely.\n\n-  **Test and optimize your recommendations:** Use\n\nexperimentation methods such as A/B testing to see\n\nhow different recommendations perform with different\n\nplayer segments. Use the insights you gain to optimize\n\nyour recommendations.\n\n-  **Be transparent:** Make sure you are transparent with\n\nplayers about how you are creating recommendations and\n\ngive them the option to opt out if they wish.\n\n-  **Use recommendations to improve the player experience:**\n\nUse personalized recommendations to improve the player\n\nexperience and increase engagement and satisfaction.\n\n### Getting Started with  Next Best Offer/Action\n\nSince NBO/NBA is a specific use case of personalization, how a\n\nteam might get started implementing this will look very similar\n\nto how they would with broader personalization activities.\n\nBegin with ensuring you are appropriately collecting player\n\ndata (behavior, preferences, in-game purchases, etc), storing\n\nit in your cloud data lake using a service such as Delta Lake\n\nfrom Databricks. From here, you‚Äôll prepare the data using\n\nDatabricks to clean, transform, and prepare for analysis.\n\nThis may include aggregating data from multiple sources,\n\nremoving duplicates and outliers, and transforming the data\n\ninto a format suitable for analysis. As you analyze the player\n\ndata, seek to identify patterns and trends in player behavior\n\n\n-----\n\nand preferences that will give you signal on which actions are\n\nmore likely to be successful.\n\nFrom here, you can build a recommendation model based\n\non the player data analysis, and incorporate information\n\non in-game items and player preferences to make\n\npersonalized recommendations.\n\nIf you have any questions about how this solution can be\n\ndeployed in your environment, please don‚Äôt hesitate to [reach](https://www.databricks.com/company/contact)\n\n[out](https://www.databricks.com/company/contact) to us.\n\n**Tips / Best Practices**\n\n-  **Define your goals:** Like every use case, starting with\n\nclearly defined goals helps to ensure your implementation\n\nof NBO and NBA will be as effective and efficient as\n\npossible. Your goals will also help you determine what data\n\nto collect and how it will be used.\n\n-  **Collect relevant data:** Based on your goals, make sure\n\nyou are collecting the right data to inform your NBO and\n\nNBA recommendations. This might include data on player\n\nbehavior, engagement, and spending habits.\n\n-  **Leverage machine learning to scale your**\n\n**recommendations:** Use machine learning algorithms to\n\nanalyze your data and make personalized recommendations\n\nto your players. This will allow you to identify trends and\n\npatterns that might not be immediately apparent.\n\n-  **Test and optimize:** THIS IS CRITICAL. Use experimentation\n\nmethods such as A/B testing to see how different\n\nrecommendations perform with different player segments.\n\nPast performance is not a perfect indicator of future\n\nsuccess. Consistent testing allows you to tune your NBO and\n\nNBA recommendations so they evolve with your playerbase.\n\n-  **Consider the player‚Äôs context:** When making recommend¬≠\n\nations, consider the player‚Äôs current context, such as what\n\nthey are doing in the game and what content they have\n\nalready consumed. This will help you create recommend¬≠\n\nations that are more likely to be relevant and timely.\n\n-  **Be transparent:** Make sure you are transparent with\n\nyour players about how you are using their data to make\n\nrecommendations, and give them the option to opt out if\n\nthey wish.\n\n-  **Collaborate with your team:** Share your NBO and NBA\n\n\n### Getting Started with  Churn Prediction & Prevention\n\nThe exciting part of this analysis is that not only does it\n\nhelp to quantify the risk of customer churn but it paints a\n\nquantitative picture of exactly which factors explain that risk.\n\nIt‚Äôs important that we not draw too rash of a conclusion with\n\nregards to the causal linkage between a particular attribute\n\nand its associated hazard, but it‚Äôs an excellent starting point\n\nfor identifying where an organization needs to focus its\n\nattention for further investigation.\n\nThe hard part in this analysis is not the analytic techniques.\n\nThe Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox Proportional Hazard\n\nmodels used to perform the analysis above are well\n\nestablished and widely supported across analytics platforms.\n\nThe principal challenge is organizing the input data.\n\nThe vast majority of subscription services are fairly new as\n\nbusinesses. As such, the data required to examine customer\n\nattrition may be scattered across multiple systems,\n\nmaking an integrated analysis more difficult. Data Lakes\n\nare a starting point for solving this problem, but complex\n\ntransformations required to cleanse and restructure data\n\nthat has evolved as the business itself has (often rapidly)\n\nevolved requires considerable processing power. This is\n\ncertainly the case with the KKBox information assets and is a\n\npoint noted by the data provider in their public challenge.\n\nThe key to successfully completing this work is the\n\nestablishment of transparent, maintainable data processing\n\npipelines executed on an elastically scalable (and therefore\n\ncost-efficient) infrastructure, a key driver behind the [Delta](https://databricks.com/blog/2019/08/14/productionizing-machine-learning-with-delta-lake.html)\n\n[Lake pattern](https://databricks.com/blog/2019/08/14/productionizing-machine-learning-with-delta-lake.html) . While most organizations may not be overly\n\ncost-conscious in their initial approach, it‚Äôs important to\n\nremember the point made above that churn is a chronic\n\ncondition to be managed. As such, this is an analysis that\n\nshould be periodically revisited to ensure acquisition and\n\nretention practices are aligned.\n\nTo support this, we are making the code behind our\n\nanalysis available for download and review. If you have any\n\nquestions about how this solution can be deployed in your\n\nenvironment, please don‚Äôt hesitate to [reach out](https://www.databricks.com/company/contact) to us.\n\n\nefforts with your team and encourage them to use the\n\n\ndata to inform their work.\n\n\n**[Churn Prediction solution accelerator](https://www.databricks.com/solutions/accelerators/survivorship-and-churn)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Tips / Best Practices**\n\n-  **Define churn:** Clearly define what you consider to be\n\nplayer churn, as this will determine how you measure\n\nand predict it. For example, you might consider churn to\n\nbe when a player stops playing your game for a certain\n\nnumber of days, or when they uninstall it.\n\n-  **Collect relevant data:** Make sure you are collecting the\n\nright data to help you predict and prevent churn. This\n\nmight include data on player behavior, engagement, and\n\nspending habits.\n\n-  **Use machine learning:** Use machine learning algorithms\n\nto analyze your data and predict which players are at\n\nrisk of churning. This will allow you to identify trends and\n\npatterns that might not be immediately apparent.\n\n-  **Test and optimize:** Use experimentation methods such as\n\nA/B testing to see how different strategies impact churn\n\nrates. Use the insights you gain to optimize your churn\n\nprevention efforts.\n\n-  **Focus on retention:** Implement retention strategies that are\n\ntailored to the needs and preferences of your players. This\n\nmight involve providing personalized content, addressing\n\npain points, or offering incentives to continue playing.\n\n-  **Be transparent:** Make sure you are transparent with your\n\nplayers about how you are using their data to predict and\n\nprevent churn, and give them the option to opt out if\n\nthey wish.\n\n-  **Collaborate with your team:** Share your churn prediction\n\nand prevention efforts with your team and encourage\n\nthem to use the data to inform their work.\n\n### Getting Started with  Read-time Ad Targeting\n\nTypically, implementing a real-time ad targeting strategy begins\n\noutside of your game (in services such as Google Ads, Unity\n\nAdvertising), where your game becomes the delivery point\n\nfor the advertisement. Here, you will need to integrate with\n\nAd networks that provide real-time ad targeting capabilities.\n\nThat will allow you to access a range of available ad assets\n\nto dynamically select and display the most relevant ads to\n\nplayers. Both Google AdMob and Unity Ads are great for banner\n\nads, native ads, and rewarded video ads. Your role is to ensure\n\nthat the data you‚Äôre collecting is fed back into the advertising\n\nplatform to better serve targeted ads to your playerbase.\n\n\nTo use a service like Databricks to manage the data needed\n\nto provide real-time ad targeting in your application, you can\n\nfollow the below steps:\n\n`1.` **Collect and store player data:** Collect data on player\n\nbehavior, preferences, and demographics, and store it in\n\na data lake using Databricks. Popular analytics tools such\n\nas Google Analytics or Mixpanel can be integrated into\n\nthe game to collect data on player behavior. These tools,\n\njust like tracking website traffic, can track in-game events,\n\nprovide insights on player behavior and demographics..\n\nand they give you access to detailed reports and\n\ndashboards. Another option is to build in-house tracking\n\nsystems to collect data on player behavior - logging\n\nevents, e.g in-game purchases or player actions, activities\n\nsuch as ‚Äúat which level does a player quit playing‚Äù and\n\nstoring this in a database for analysis. The downside of\n\nbuilding in-house tracking systems is you will need to host\n\nand maintain your own logging servers.\n\n`2.` **Prepare the data:** Use Databricks to clean, transform,\n\nand prepare the player data for analysis. This may\n\ninclude aggregating data from multiple sources, removing\n\nduplicates and outliers, and transforming the data into a\n\nformat suitable for analysis.\n\n`3.` **Analyze the data:** Use Databricks‚Äô built-in machine\n\nlearning and data analytics capabilities to analyze the\n\nplayer data and identify patterns and trends.\n\n`4.` **Create audience segments:** Based on the analysis,\n\nuse Databricks to create audience segments based on\n\ncommon characteristics such as interests, behaviors,\n\nand preferences.\n\n`5.` **Integrate with the ad server:** When an ad opportunity\n\npresents itself within the game, a call is made to the ad\n\nserver. This call includes information about the player,\n\nsuch as the audience segment that they belong to. The\n\nad server then uses this information to decide what ad to\n\ndeliver to the player.\n\n`6.` **Monitor and optimize:** Use Databricks to monitor the\n\nperformance of the ad targeting and make optimizations\n\nas needed, such as adjusting the audience segments or\n\nadjusting the targeting algorithms.\n\nBy using a service like Databricks to manage the data needed\n\nfor real-time ad targeting, game developers can effectively\n\nleverage their player data to create more personalized and\n\nengaging experiences, increase revenue, and reduce churn.\n\n\n-----\n\nIf you have any questions about how this solution can be\n\ndeployed in your environment, please don‚Äôt hesitate to [reach](https://www.databricks.com/company/contact)\n\n[out](https://www.databricks.com/company/contact) to us.\n\n**Tips / Best Practices**\n\n-  **Focus on player data:** Make player data the center of your\n\ntargeting strategy by collecting and storing comprehensive\n\ninformation on player behavior, preferences, and\n\ndemographics. Here, it‚Äôs critical to ensure the game code\n\ndata trackers are properly implemented in order to collect\n\nthis data (see Game Analytics section for detail).\n\n-  **Segment your audience:** Create audience segments\n\nbased on common characteristics such as interests,\n\nbehaviors, and preferences, and use these segments to\n\n\n**Test and iterate:** Continuously test and iterate your\n\ntargeting strategy to refine your audience segments and\n\nimprove targeting accuracy.\n\n**Balance relevance and privacy:** Balance the need for\n\nrelevant, personalized ads with players‚Äô privacy by only\n\ncollecting and using data that is necessary for targeting\n\nand obtaining player consent.\n\n**Monitor performance:** Regularly monitor the performance\n\nof your targeting strategy to ensure that it is delivering the\n\ndesired results and make optimizations as needed.\n\n**Partner with the right ad platform:** Choose an ad\n\nplatform that is well-suited to your needs and aligns with\n\nyour goals, and work closely with them to ensure that your\n\ntargeting strategy is delivering the best results.\n\n\ndeliver targeted ads.\n\n# Operational use cases\n\n\n### Anomaly Detection\n\nFirst thing is to begin collecting the data, game server / client\n\nlogs out of your project. Then consume this into Databricks\n\nDelta, to have a continuous anomaly detection model\n\nrunning. Focus this on key pieces of information you want to\n\nmonitor, for example - for live service games, this is going to\n\nbe infrastructure and network-related metrics such as Ping\n\nand Server Health (# of clients connected, server uptime,\n\nserver usage, CPU/RAM, # of sessions, time of sessions).\n\nOnce the model is ingesting and tuned specifically for the\n\nmetrics based on the information you have above. You would\n\nbuild out alerts or notifications based on these specific\n\nmetrics hitting a threshold that you define as needing\n\nattention. From here, you can build out automated systems\n\nto mitigate those effects - such as migrating players to a\n\ndifferent server, canceling matches, scaling infrastructure,\n\ncreating tickets for admins to review.\n\nIf you have any questions about how this solution can be\n\ndeployed in your environment, please don‚Äôt hesitate to [reach](https://www.databricks.com/company/contact)\n\n[out](https://www.databricks.com/company/contact) to us.\n\n\n**Tips / Best Practices**\n\n-  **Define the problem and objectives clearly:** Before\n\nimplementing an anomaly detection solution, it is\n\nimportant to define the problem you are trying to solve\n\nand your specific objectives. This will help ensure that\n\nyou have the right data sources and use the appropriate\n\nalgorithms to achieve your goals.\n\n-  **Choose the right data sources:** To effectively detect\n\nanomalies, you need to have the right data sources.\n\nConsider data from player behavior, system performance,\n\nand network traffic, as well as any other data sources that\n\nare relevant to your problem and objectives.\n\n-  **Clean and preprocess the data:** To ensure that the\n\ndata you use for anomaly detection is accurate and\n\nmeaningful, it is important to clean and preprocess the\n\ndata. This includes removing any irrelevant or invalid data,\n\nhandling missing values, and normalizing the data\n\nif necessary.\n\n-  **Choose the right algorithms:** There are many algorithms\n\nthat can be used for anomaly detection, including\n\nstatistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and\n\nrule-based systems. Choose the algorithms that are best\n\n\n-----\n\nsuited to your data and problem, and that provide the\n\nright level of accuracy, speed, and scalability.\n\n-  **Validate the results:** Before deploying the anomaly\n\ndetection solution in production, it is important to validate\n\nthe results by testing the solution on a small subset of\n\ndata and comparing the results to expected outcomes.\n\n-  **Monitor and update the solution:** Once the anomaly\n\ndetection solution is deployed, it is important to monitor\n\nits performance and accuracy, and update the solution as\n\nneeded. This may include retraining the algorithms, adding\n\nor removing data sources, and updating the parameters\n\nand thresholds used by the algorithms.\n\nAdditionally, there are some key gotchas to look out for when\n\nimplementing an anomaly detection solution.\n\n-  **Avoid overfitting:** Overfitting occurs when the anomaly\n\ndetection solution is too complex and learns the noise\n\nin the data rather than the underlying patterns. To avoid\n\noverfitting, it is important to choose algorithms that are\n\nappropriate for the size and complexity of the data, and to\n\nvalidate the results using a separate test dataset.\n\n-  **False positive and false negative results:** False positive\n\nand false negative results can occur when the anomaly\n\ndetection solution is not properly calibrated, or when\n\nthe solution is applied to data that is significantly\n\ndifferent from the training data. To minimize the risk of\n\nfalse positive and false negative results, it is important\n\nto validate the results using a separate test dataset, and\n\nto fine-tune the parameters and thresholds used by the\n\nalgorithms as needed.\n\n-  **Scalability:** Scalability can be a concern when\n\nimplementing an anomaly detection solution, especially\n\nwhen dealing with large amounts of data. To ensure that\n\nthe solution can scale to meet the demands of a growing\n\nplayer base, it is important to choose algorithms that\n\nare fast and scalable, and to deploy the solution using a\n\nscalable infrastructure.\n\n### Getting Started with  Build Pipeline\n\nAn operational goal game projects have is to make sure\n\ngame project builds are generated, delivered quickly and\n\nefficiently to internal testing & external users.\n\n\nA few of the key metrics and capabilities with analyzing your\n\nbuild pipelines are the below:\n\n-  **Build time and speed:** This includes metrics such as\n\nthe time it takes to create a build, number of builds, and\n\ncompute spent.\n\n-  **Build size and storage:** size of the builds, amount of\n\nstorage, and network costs.\n\n-  **Bug tracking and resolution:** This includes metrics such\n\nas the number of bugs reported, the time it takes to\n\nresolve them, and the number of bugs that are resolved in\n\neach build.\n\n-  **Code quality and efficiency:** This includes metrics such\n\nas code complexity, code duplication, and the number of\n\ncode lines written.\n\n-  **Collaboration and communication:** Such as the number\n\nof code reviews, the number of team meetings, and the\n\nnumber of code commits.\n\n-  **Advanced capabilities:** Such as Predicting real time build\n\nfailure to reduce spend and combining build data with\n\nCrash Analytics (see below) to have ‚Äúcommit to build‚Äù\n\nvisibility for accelerated bug fixing.\n\nBefore you start implementing your build pipeline, it‚Äôs\n\nimportant to define your requirements. What are the key\n\ngoals of your build pipeline? Choosing the right CI/CD tools is\n\ncritical to the success of your build pipeline. There are many\n\ndifferent tools available, including Jenkins, Azure Devops,\n\nPerforce, gitlab and more. When choosing a CI/CD tool,\n\nconsider factors such as ease of use, scalability, and cost. In\n\naddition, consider the specific needs of your game project,\n\nand choose a tool that can meet those needs.\n\nThe general recommendation is to look at automating your\n\nbuild process early. Once you‚Äôve chosen your CI/CD tools, you\n\ncan automate your build process by setting up a build server,\n\nconfiguring your CI/CD tool, and creating a script to build your\n\ngame project. The build process should be automated as much\n\nas possible, and it should include steps to compile your code,\n\nrun automated tests, and generate a build of your project.\n\nOnce you have automated your build process, often the\n\nnext step is to implement CD (Continuous Delivery). This\n\ninvolves automating the deployment of your game builds\n\ndelivery to stakeholders, such as QA testers, beta testers, or\n\nend-users via publishing platforms. CD can help ensure that\n\nstakeholders have access to the latest version of your game\n\n\n-----\n\nas soon as possible, allowing them to provide feedback and\n\nhelp drive the development process forward.\n\nFinally, it‚Äôs important to monitor and measure your build\n\npipeline to ensure that it‚Äôs working as expected. This can\n\ninvolve using tools such as Databricks Dashboards to\n\nvisualize the status of your pipeline, or using metrics such\n\nas build times, test results, and deployment success rates\n\nto evaluate the performance of your pipeline. By monitoring\n\nand measuring your build pipeline, you can identify areas for\n\nimprovement and make changes as needed to ensure that\n\nyour pipeline continues to meet your needs.\n\nIf you have any questions about how databricks can\n\nintegrate into your devops solution, please don‚Äôt hesitate to\n\n[reach out](https://www.databricks.com/company/contact) to us.\n\n**Tips / Best Practices**\n\n-  **Seek to automate early and often:** Automate as much\n\nof the build process as possible, from checking code into\n\nversion control to generating builds and distributing them\n\nto stakeholders. This can help reduce errors and save time,\n\nallowing game teams to focus on more high value tasks.\n\n\n**Version control, version control, version control:** Use a\n\nversion control system to manage the source code and\n\nother assets. This ensures that changes to the codebase\n\nare tracked and can be easily undone if needed.\n\n**Implement continuous integration and delivery:**\n\nContinuous integration (CI) involves automatically building\n\nand testing after code changes are checked into version\n\ncontrol. With CI, new changes to the codebase do not\n\nbreak existing functionality. By automating the build\n\nprocess, CI helps to reduce errors and save time. CD, on\n\nthe other hand, involves automatically delivering builds to\n\nstakeholders, such as QA testers, beta testers, or end-\n\nusers, after they have passed the automated tests. By\n\ncombining CI and CD, a video game project can ensure\n\nthat builds are generated and delivered quickly and\n\nefficiently, without the need for manual intervention.\n\n**Build for scalability:** As your game project grows, you\n\nwill need a build pipeline solution that is scalable and can\n\nhandle the needs of your game team.\n\n**Integration with other tools:** Integrate the build pipeline\n\nsolution with other tools and systems, such as issue\n\ntracking, testing, and deployment tools, to ensure a\n\nsmooth and efficient workflow.\n\n\n**Reference Architecture**\n\n**Databricks**\n**SQL**\n\n**Power BI**\n\n\n|GAME INFRASTRUCTURE|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|||\n|||\n\n\n**AWS**\n\n**Quicksight**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Getting Started with  Crash Analytics\n\nBuilding a pipeline to build a holistic view to support crash\n\nanalytics means data coming from multiple different\n\nsources, different velocities and joining the data together.\n\nThe amount of data sources depends on your game projects\n\npublishing platforms, some may come from console based\n\nproviders such as sony, xbox, and nintendo or pc platforms\n\nlike Steam, Epic Games Marketplace, GoG and many others.\n\n**High level steps**\n\n-  Determine what platforms your game is running on and\n\nhow to interface to collect data.\n\n-  **Collect crash data:** Implement crash reporting tools in\n\nyour game to collect data on crashes. The source data\n\nmay be delivered in varying formats such as JSON or CSV.\n\n-  **Load crash data into Databricks:** Use Databricks‚Äô data\n\ningestion tools to load the crash data into your workspace.\n\nThis could involve using Databricks‚Äô built-in data source\n\nconnectors, or programmatically ingest files to load the data.\n\n\n\n-  **Transform and clean the crash data:** Use Databricks‚Äô\n\ndata processing and transformation tools to clean and\n\nprepare the crash data for analysis. This could involve\n\nusing Databricks‚Äô capabilities like DLT, or using SQL to\n\nperform custom transformations.\n\n-  **Visualize crash data:** Use Databricks‚Äô dashboarding tools\n\nto create visualizations that help you understand the\n\npatterns and trends in your crash data. This could involve\n\nusing Databricks‚Äô built-in visualization tools, or integrating\n\nwith external visualization tools like Tableau or PowerBI.\n\n-  **Analyze crash data:** Use Databricks‚Äô machine learning\n\nand statistical analysis tools to identify the root causes\n\nof crashes. This could involve using Spark MLlib or many\n\nof the popular tools to build machine learning models, or\n\nusing SQL to perform custom analyses.\n\n-  **Monitor and refine your pipeline:** Regularly review your\n\npipeline to ensure that it remains relevant and useful.\n\nRefine your pipeline as necessary to reflect changes in\n\nyour crash data or your goals.\n\nIf you have any questions about how this solution can be\n\ndeployed in your environment, please don‚Äôt hesitate to [reach](https://www.databricks.com/company/contact)\n\n[out](https://www.databricks.com/company/contact) to us.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Tips / Best Practices**\n\n-  **Automated collection and aggregation of crash reports:**\n\nCollecting crash reports should be an automated process\n\nthat is integrated into the output of the build pipeline\n\nfor the game. The crash reports should be automatically\n\naggregated and made available for analysis in near real-time.\n\n-  **Clear reporting and prioritization of issues:** The solution\n\nshould provide clear reporting on the most common\n\nissues and allow game developers to prioritize fixing the\n\nmost impactful problems first.\n\n-  **Integration with other analytics tools:** The crash analytics\n\nsolution should integrate with other analytics tools, such\n\nas player behavior tracking, to provide a more complete\n\npicture of how crashes are impacting the player experience.\n\n-  **Flexibility and scalability:** As the game grows, the\n\n\nAdditionally, there are some key gotchas to look out for when\n\nimplementing an anomaly detection solution.\n\n-  **Data privacy and security:** Ensure that crash reports do\n\nnot contain sensitive information that could be used to\n\nidentify individual players.\n\n-  **Scalability:** As the number of players and crashes\n\nincreases, it may become difficult to manage and analyze\n\nthe growing volume of data.\n\n-  **Integration with other tools:** Be aware when integrating\n\ncrash analytics with other tools and systems, especially if\n\nthe tools use different data formats or data structures.\n\n-  **Prioritization of issues:** Determine which crashes are\n\nthe most impactful and prioritize fixes accordingly. This\n\ncan be a complex process, especially if there are a large\n\nnumber of different crash types and causes.\n\n\nsolution should be able to scale to accommodate an\n\nincreasing number of players and crashes.\n\n**Data privacy and security:** It‚Äôs important to consider data\n\nprivacy and security when implementing a crash analytics\n\nsolution. This may involve implementing measures to\n\nanonymize crash reports, or taking steps to ensure that\n\nsensitive information is not included in the reports.\n\n**Reference Architecture**\n\n**Databricks**\n**SQL**\n\n**Power BI**\n\n**AWS**\n\n**Quicksight**\n\n\n-----",

The Lakehouse implementation from\n\nDatabricks combines the best features of EDWs\n\nand data lakes by enabling all their workloads using\n\nopen source and open standards ‚Äî avoiding the\n\nvendor lock-in, black box design and proprietary\n\ndata formats of other cloud vendors.\n\n\nIt‚Äôs not surprising that many industry experts say data is the most valuable resource in the modern\n\neconomy ‚Äî some even go so far as to describe it as the ‚Äúnew oil.‚Äù But at Databricks, we think of data as\n\nwater. Its core compound never changes, and it can be transformed to whatever use case is desired,\n\nwith the ability to get it back to its original form. Furthermore, just as water is essential to life, data is now\n\nessential to survival, competitive differentiation and innovation for every business. Clearly, the impact and\n\nimportance of data are growing exponentially in both our professional and personal lives, while artificial\n\nintelligence (AI) is being infused in more of our daily digital interactions. The explosion in data availability\n\nover the last decade and the forecast for growth at a compounded [annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23%](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId%3DprUS47560321&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1651117260200496&usg=AOvVaw3jdZ_6YHlXGQlUMJK8ULux) over\n\n2020‚Äì2025 ‚Äî combined with low-cost cloud storage, compute, open source software and machine learning\n\n(ML) environments ‚Äî have caused a major shift in how organizations leverage data and AI to improve data\n\ngovernance and the user experience, plus satisfy more AI/ML-based use cases to drive future growth.\n\nEvery organization is working to improve business outcomes while effectively managing a variety of risks ‚Äî\n\nincluding economic, compliance, security and fraud, financial, reputational, operational and competitive risk.\n\nYour organization‚Äôs data and the systems that process it play a critical role in not only enabling your financial\n\ngoals but also in minimizing these seven key business risks.\n\nBusinesses have realized that their legacy information technology (IT) platforms are not able to scale and\n\nmeet the increasing demands for better data analytics. As a result, they are looking to transform how their\n\norganizations use and process data. Successful data transformation initiatives for data, analytics and AI\n\ninvolve not only the design of hardware and software systems but also the alignment of people, processes\n\nand platforms. These initiatives always require a major financial investment and, therefore, need to yield a\n\nsignificant return on investment (ROI) ‚Äî one that starts in months, not years.\n\nTo guide these initiatives, many organizations are adding the role of chief data officer (CDO) to their C-suite.\n\nDespite this structural change and focused resources, [87% of organizations](https://databricks.com/discover/mit-infographic) still face many challenges\n\nto deliver on their data strategy ‚Äî including how to deploy a modern data architecture, leverage data\n\nefficiently and securely, stay compliant with an ever-increasing set of regulations, hire the right talent, and\n\nidentify and execute on AI opportunities.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo successfully lead data and AI transformation initiatives, organizations need to develop and execute\n\na comprehensive strategy that enables them to easily deploy a modern data architecture, unlock the\n\nfull potential of all their data, and future-proof their investments to provide the greatest ROI. Today,\n\norganizations have the option of moving away from closed, proprietary systems offered by a variety\n\nof cloud vendors and adopting a strategy that emphasizes open, nonproprietary solutions built using\n\nindustry standards.\n\nAt Databricks, we have helped over 7,000 companies achieve data, analytics and AI breakthroughs, and\n\nwe‚Äôve hired industry experts and thought leaders to help organizations better understand the steps involved\n\nin successful digital transformation initiatives. We are the first vendor to propose the data lakehouse\n\narchitecture, which decouples data storage from compute while providing the best price/performance\n\nmetrics for all your data workloads ‚Äî including data warehousing. We have captured the lessons learned\n\nand summarized them in this series of Executive Guides ‚Äî which are designed to serve as blueprints for\n\nCIOs, CDOs, CTOs and other data and technology executives to implement successful digital transformation\n\ninitiatives for data, analytics and AI using a _modern data stack_ . Databricks is the first company to deliver a\n\nunified data platform that realizes the data lakehouse architecture and enables the data personas in your\n\norganization to run their data, analytics and AI workloads in a simple, open and collaborative environment, as\n\nshown in Figure 1.\n\n\n###### Lakehouse Platform\n\n\nData\nWarehousing\n\n\nData\nEngineering\n\n\nData\nStreaming\n\n\nData SÔøΩienÔøΩÔøΩ\nand ML\n\n\nUnity Catalog\nFine-grained governance for data and AI\n\nDelta Lake\nData relia)ility and .erfor2ance\n\nCloud Data Lake\nAll structured and unstructured data\n\n**Figure 1:**\nThe Databricks Lakehouse Platform\n\n\n-----\n\n**The lakehouse architecture benefits organizations in several ways:**\n\n**1.** It leverages low-cost cloud object stores to store ALL enterprise data.\n\n**2.** \u0007It provides the ability to run different data workloads efficiently and in a cost-effective manner.\n\n**3.** \u0007It uses open formats and standards that provide greater data portability ‚Äî thus avoiding vendor lock-in.\n\nOur intention is to present key considerations and equip you with the knowledge to ask informed questions,\n\nmake the most critical decisions early in the process, and develop the comprehensive strategy that most\n\norganizations lack.\n\nIn addition, we have created an easy-to-follow Data and AI Maturity Model and provided a comprehensive\n\nprofessional services offering that organizations can leverage to measure their readiness, reskill their staff\n\nand track progress as they embark on their data transformation initiative.\n\n\n-----\n\n**CHAPTER 2:**\n## Define the Strategy\n\n\nThe most critical step to enable data, analytics and AI at scale is to develop a comprehensive and executable\n\nstrategy for how your organization will leverage people, processes and platforms to drive measurable\n\nbusiness results against your corporate priorities. The strategy serves as a set of principles that every\n\nmember of your organization can refer to when making decisions. The strategy should cover the roles and\n\nresponsibilities of teams within your organization for how you capture, store, curate and process data to run\n\nyour business ‚Äî including the internal and external resources (labor and budget) needed to be successful.\n\n\nEstablish the\ngoals and\nbusiness value\n\n\nBuild\nsuccessful\ndata teams\n\n\nEase data\ngovernance and\ncompliance\n\n\nSimplify\nthe user\nexperience\n\n\nAllocate,\nmonitor and\noptimize costs\n\n\nIdentify and\nprioritize\nuse cases\n\n\nDeploy a modern\ndata architecture\n\n\nDemocratize\naccess to\nquality data\n\n\nMake informed\nbuild vs. buy\ndecisions\n\n\nMove to\nproduction and\ndrive adoption\n\n\n**Figure 2:**\nThe 10 steps to a winning data and AI strategy\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Here are 10 key considerations\n\n**1.** \u0007Secure buy-in and alignment on the overall business goals, timeline and appetite for the initiative.\n\n**2.** \u0007Identify, evaluate and prioritize use cases that actually provide a significant ROI.\n\n**3.** \u0007Create high-performing teams and empower your business analyst, data scientist, machine learning\n\nand data engineering talent.\n\n**4.** \u0007Future-proof your technology investment with a modern data architecture.\n\n**5.** \u0007Ensure you satisfy the European Union‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California\n\nConsumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and other emerging data compliance and governance regulations.\n\n**6.** \u0007Implement needed policies, procedures and technology to guarantee data quality and enable secure\n\ndata access and the sharing of all your data across the organization.\n\n**7.** \u0007Streamline the user experience (UX), improve collaboration and simplify the complexity of your tooling.\n\n**8.** \u0007Make informed build vs. buy decisions and ensure you are focusing your limited resources on the most\n\nimportant problems.\n\n**9.** \u0007Establish the initial budgets and allocate and optimize costs based on SLAs and usage patterns.\n\n**10.** \u0007Codify best practices for moving into production and how to measure progress, rate of adoption and\n\nuser satisfaction.\n\nThe strategy should clearly answer these 10 topics and more, and should be captured in a living document,\n\nowned and governed by the CDO and made available for everyone in the organization to review and provide\n\nfeedback on. The strategy will evolve based on the changing market/political conditions, evolving business,\n\nthe technology landscape or a combination of any of these ‚Äî but it should serve as the North Star for\n\nhow you will navigate the many decisions and trade-offs that you will need to make over the course of the\n\ntransformation.\n\n\nThis guide takes a stepwise approach to\n\naddressing each of these 10 topics.\n\n\n-----\n\nStudies have shown that data scientists spend 80%\n\nof their time collecting and compiling data sets\n\n\n#### 1. Establish the goals and business value\n\nMost organizations on a data, analytics and AI journey establish a set of goals for the resulting investment.\n\nThe goals generally fall into one of three categories:\n\n**1.** **Business outcomes**\n\n**2.** **People**\n\n**3.** **Technology**\n\n\nand only 20% of their time developing insights and\n\n\nIn terms of business outcomes, organizations need to adapt more quickly to market opportunities and\n\nemerging risks, and their legacy-based information systems make that difficult to achieve. As a result,\n\nbusiness leaders see the digital transformation as an opportunity to build a new technology foundation\n\nfrom which to run their business and increase business value. One that is more agile, scalable, secure and\n\neasier to use ‚Äî making the organization better positioned to adapt, innovate and thrive in the modern and\n\ndynamic economy.\n\nFor organizations today, people are one of their most valuable assets ‚Äî you cannot succeed in data,\n\nanalytics and AI without them. The battle for top talent is as fierce as ever, and the way that people work\n\nimpacts your ability to hire and retain the skills you need to succeed. It is important to make sure that\n\nemployees work in a frictionless data environment, to the extent possible, so they feel productive each day\n\nand can do their best work.\n\nFinally, from a technology perspective, organizations have grown tired of the high costs associated with\n\ncomplex system architectures, vendor lock-in, and proprietary solutions that are slow to evolve. The\n\nindustry trend is to move away from large capital expenditures (capex) to pay for network and server\n\ncapacity in advance ‚Äî and toward a ‚Äújust-in-time‚Äù and ‚Äúpay-for-what-you-use‚Äù operating expense (opex)\n\napproach. Your data analytics environment should support this trend as well ‚Äî using open standards, low-\n\ncost storage and on-demand compute that efficiently spins up to perform data workloads and spins down\n\nonce they are complete.\n\n\nalgorithms. Organizations that are able to invert\n\nthese numbers benefit in two ways ‚Äî happier\n\nemployees and improved time to market for use\n\ncases. These employers create more favorable\n\nworking environments and lower the risk of burnout\n\nand the resulting regrettable attrition.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Executive buy-in and support**\n\nLarge organizations are difficult to change ‚Äî but it‚Äôs not impossible. In order to be successful, you need\n\nto have unwavering buy-in and support from the highest levels of management ‚Äî including the CEO and\n\nboard of directors. With this support, you have the leverage you need to develop the strategy, decide on\n\nan architecture and implement a solution that can truly change the way your business is run. Without it,\n\nyou have a very expensive science project that has little hope of succeeding. Why? Because the majority\n\nof people in your organization are busy doing their day jobs. The added work to support the initiative must\n\nbe offset by a clear articulation of the resulting benefits ‚Äî not only for the business but for the personnel\n\nwithin it. The transformation should result in a positive change to how people do their jobs on a daily basis.\n\nTransformation for data, analytics and AI needs to be a company-wide initiative that has the support from\n\nall the leaders. Even if the approach is to enable data and AI one business unit (BU) at a time, the plan needs\n\nto be something that is fully embraced in order to succeed. Ideally, the senior-most executives serve as\n\nvocal proponents.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Evolve to an AI-first company ‚Äî not just a data-first company**\n\nData and AI transformations should truly transform the way organizations use data, not just evolve it. For\n\ndecades, businesses have operated using traditional business processes and leveraged Structured Query\n\nLanguage (SQL) and business intelligence (BI) tools to query, manipulate and report on a subset of their\n\ndata. There are five major challenges with this approach:\n\n**1.** \u0007A true self-assessment of where your organization is on the AI maturity curve. Most organizations will\n\nuse pockets of success with analytics and AI to move higher up the maturity curve, but in reality the\n\nability to replicate and scale the results is nearly impossible.\n\nAutoÔøΩated DecisionÔøΩMaÔøΩing\n\n#### Tech leaders are to the right of the Data Maturity Curve\n\n\nPrescriptive AnalÔøΩtics\n\nPredictive Modeling\n\nData Exploration\n\n\nFrom hindsight to foresight\n\n\nHow should\nwe respond?\n\n\nAutoÔøΩaticallÔøΩ ÔøΩaÔøΩÔøΩ\nthe best decision\n\n\nAd Hoc Queries\n\nReports\nClean Data\n\nWHAT HAPPENED? WHAT W255 HAPPEN?\n\nData and A2 MaturitÔøΩ\n\n\n**Figure 3:**\nThe Data Maturity Curve\n\n\n-----\n\n**2.** \u0007Data volumes and types have outgrown even the most modern approaches to SQL-based data\n\nprocessing.\n\n**3.** \u0007These large data volumes also make it nearly impossible for your workforce to continue to\n\nprogrammatically state, in a priority manner, how data insights can be achieved or how the business\n\nshould react to changing data.\n\n**4.** \u0007Organizations need to reduce the costs of processing all this data. You simply cannot afford to hire the\n\nnumber of people needed to respond to every piece of data flowing into your environment. Machines\n\nscale, people do not.\n\n**5.** \u0007Advances in machine learning and AI have simplified the steps and reduced the expertise needed to\n\ngain game-changing insights. For these reasons, plus many others, the organizations that thrive in the\n\n21st century will do so based on their ability to leverage all the data at their disposal. Traditional ways\n\nof processing and managing data will not work. Using ML and AI will empower your workforce to\n\nleverage data to make better decisions for managing risk, helping your organization succeed in the\n\nmodern economy.\n\n**Go ‚Äúall in‚Äù on the cloud**\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused rapid adoption of cloud-based solutions for collaboration and\n\nvideoconferencing ‚Äî and organizations are now using this time to reevaluate their use of on-premises and\n\ncloud-based services. The cloud vendors provide many benefits to organizations, including Infrastructure\n\nas a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions. These benefits,\n\nespecially when combined with the use of open source software (OSS), increase the speed at which\n\norganizations can use the latest technologies while also reducing their capex in these budget-conscious times.\n\nFor AWS, Microsoft, Google and other cloud providers, the game is about data acquisition. The more\n\ncorporate data that resides in a specific cloud, the more sticky the customer is to the vendor. At the same\n\ntime, multicloud support is both a selling point and an aspirational goal for many organizations. Companies\n\nare well aware of vendor lock-in and want to abstract their applications so they can be moved across\n\nclouds if there is a compelling business reason.\n\n\n-----\n\nApproaching your technology choices with a multicloud point of view gives the organization more sovereignty\n\nover the data ‚Äî flexibility to run workloads anywhere, ease of integration when acquiring businesses that\n\nrun on different cloud providers and simplified compliance with emerging regulations that may require\n\ncompanies to be multicloud ‚Äî as part of a mandate to reduce risk to the consumer‚Äôs personal information.\n\nAs a result, data portability and the ability to run workloads on different cloud providers are becoming\n\nincreasingly important.\n\n**Modernize business applications**\n\nAs organizations begin to accelerate the adoption of the cloud, they should avoid a simple ‚Äúlift and shift‚Äù\n\napproach. The majority of on-premises applications are not built with the cloud in mind. They usually\n\ndiffer in the way that they handle security, resiliency, scalability and failover. Their application designs\n\noften store data in ways that make it difficult to adhere to regulatory requirements such as the GDPR and\n\nCCPA standards. Finally, the features and capabilities of the application may be monolithic in nature and,\n\ntherefore, tightly coupled. In contrast, modern cloud applications are modular in design and use RESTful web\n\nservices and APIs to easily provide access to an application‚Äôs functionality.\n\nCloud-based architectures, commodity databases and software application development frameworks make\n\nit easier for developers to build scalable, secure end-to-end applications to run all your internal business\n\nprocesses. Building n-tiered applications (e.g., mobile and web-based applications with RESTful APIs and\n\na backing database) has become straightforward with the latest tooling available to your application\n\ndevelopment teams.\n\nAs a first step, organizations should inventory their business-critical applications, prioritize them based\n\non business impact and modernize them in a consistent manner for cloud-based deployments. It is these\n\napplications that generate and store a significant amount of the data consumed within an organization. Using\n\na consistent approach to cloud-based application design makes it easier to extract data when it is needed.\n\n\n‚ÄúWe are on an amazing journey. Being among\n\nthe fastest-growing enterprise software cloud\n\ncompanies on record was unimaginable when\n\nwe started Databricks. To get here, we‚Äôve stayed\n\nfocused on the three big bets we made when\n\nfounding the company ‚Äî cloud, open source\n\nand machine learning. Fast-forward seven years,\n\nthousands of data teams around the globe are\n\nworking better together on Databricks.‚Äù\n\n**Ali Ghodsi**\n\nCo-founder and CEO\n\nDatabricks\n\n\n-----\n\nThe next step is to identify which applications are viewed as the system of record (SOR) for a given data set.\n\nA good architectural principle is to only allow data sets to be stored inside their declared SOR and not allow\n\nother applications within your environment to store copies of the data ‚Äî unless absolutely necessary for\n\nperformance reasons. In this case, it is best to ‚Äúcache‚Äù the data for use in the non-SOR application and sync\n\nthe data from the actual SOR.\n\nData from these SORs should be made available in three ways:\n\n**1.** \u0007 Expose a set of RESTful APIs for applications to invoke at any given time.\n\n**2.** \u0007Ensure that copies of the data land in the data lake.\n\n**3.** \u0007Change data capture (CDC) and other business events should be streamed in real time for immediate\n\nconsumption by downstream applications.\n\n**Move toward real-time decisioning**\n\nThe value of data should be viewed through two different lenses. The first is to view data in the aggregate,\n\nand the second is to view data as an individual event. This so-called ‚Äútime value of data‚Äù is an important\n\nconcept in the world of data, analytics and AI. To be effective, you need to be able to leverage both ‚Äî on\n\nthe same data platform.\n\nOn the one hand, data in aggregate becomes more valuable over time ‚Äî as you collect more of it. The\n\naggregate data provides the ability to look back in time and see the complete history of an aspect of your\n\nbusiness and to discover trends. Real-time data is most valuable the moment it is captured. In contrast, a\n\nnewly created or arriving data event gives you the opportunity to make decisions ‚Äî in the moment ‚Äî that\n\ncan positively affect your ability to reduce risk, better service your customers or lower your operating costs.\n\nThe goal is to act immediately ‚Äî with reliability and accuracy ‚Äî upon the arrival of a new streaming event.\n\nThis ‚Äútime value of data‚Äù is shown in Figure 4 on the next page.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor example, real-time processing of clickstream data from your customer-facing mobile application can\n\nindicate when the customer is having trouble and may need to call into your call center. This insight gives\n\nyou the opportunity to interject with a digital assistant or to pass on ‚Äújust-in-time‚Äù information to your call\n\ncenter agents ‚Äî improving the customer experience and lowering customer churn.\n\nData, analytics and AI rely on the ‚Äùtime value of data‚Äù ‚Äî a powerful concept that allows you to train your\n\nmachine learning models using historical data and provides you with the ability to make real-time decisions\n\nas new events take place. For example, credit card fraud models can use deep historical data about a given\n\ncustomer‚Äôs buying patterns (location, day of week, time of day, retailer, average purchase amount, etc.) to\n\nbuild rich models that are then executed for each new credit card transaction. This real-time execution,\n\ncombined with historical data, enables the best possible customer experience.\n\n#### Time Value of Data\n\n\nThe Databricks Lakehouse Platform allows you to\n\ncombine real-time streaming and batch processing\n\nusing one architecture and a consistent set of\n\nprogramming APIs.\n\n**Figure 4:**\nTime Value of Data\n\n\nValue of an individual data\n\nrecord is very high once created\nbut decreases over time\n\n\nValue of data records\n\nin aggregate increases\nover time\n\n\nReal-Time Decisioning Real-Time Analysis Trend Analysis Model Training\n\n\n-----\n\n**Land** **_all_** **data in a data lake**\n\nIn order to effectively drive data, analytics and AI adoption, relevant data needs to be made available to the\n\nuser as quickly as possible. Data is often siloed in various business applications and is hard and/or slow to\n\naccess. Likewise, organizations can no longer afford to wait for data to be loaded into data stores like a data\n\nwarehouse, with predefined schemas that are designed to allow you to ask very specific questions about\n\nthat data only. What do you do when you want to ask a different question? To further complicate matters,\n\nhow do you handle new data sets that cannot easily be manipulated to fit into your predefined data stores?\n\nHow do you find new insights as quickly as possible?\n\nThe overall goal is to gain insights from the data as quickly as possible ‚Äî which can happen at any step\n\nalong the data pipeline ‚Äî including raw, refined and curated data states.\n\nThis phenomenon has led to the concept known as the four Vs of data ‚Äî specifically, _volume_ , _velocity_ ,\n\n_variety_ and _veracity_ . Data-, analytics- and AI-driven organizations need to be able to store and process\n\nall their data, regardless of size, shape or speed. In addition, data lineage and provenance are critical to\n\nknowing whether or not you can trust the data.\n\n**Change the way people work**\n\nWhen done correctly, organizations get value from data, analytics and AI in three ways ‚Äî infrastructure\n\nsavings, productivity gains and business-impacting use cases. Productivity gains require a true focus on\n\nminimizing the number of steps needed to produce results with data. This can be accomplished by:\n\n**1.** \u0007 Making data more accessible and ensuring it can be trusted\n\n**2.** Minimizing the number of tools/systems needed to perform work\n\n**3.** Creating a flywheel effect by leveraging the work of others\n\n\n‚ÄúWe believe that the data lakehouse architecture\n\npresents an opportunity comparable to the one\n\nwe saw during early years of the data warehouse\n\nmarket. The unique ability of the lakehouse to\n\nmanage data in an open environment, blend all\n\nvarieties of data from all parts of the enterprise and\n\ncombine the data science focus of the data lake\n\nwith the end-user analytics of the data warehouse\n\nwill unlock incredible value for organizations.‚Äù\n\n**Bill Inmon**\n\nThe father of the data warehouse\n\n\n-----\n\nIn large organizations, it‚Äôs understandable why application and data silos are prevalent. Each business unit\n\nis laser-focused on achieving their goals, and the use of information technology is viewed as an enabler.\n\nSystems and applications get built over time to satisfy specific needs within a line of business. As a result,\n\nit‚Äôs not surprising to learn that employees must jump through a large number of hoops to get access to the\n\ndata they need to do their jobs. It should be as simple as getting your identity and PC.\n\nWith Databricks, users can collaborate and perform\n\n\nA primary goal of your data and AI transformation should be to focus on improving the user experience ‚Äî\n\nin other words, improving how your entire organization interacts with data. Data must be easily discoverable\n\nwith default access to users based on their role(s) ‚Äî with a simple process to compliantly request access to\n\ndata sets that are currently restricted. The tooling you make available should satisfy the principal needs of\n\nthe various personas ‚Äî data engineers, data scientists, machine learning engineers, business analysts, etc.\n\nFinally, the results of the work performed by a user or system upstream should be made available to users\n\nand systems downstream as ‚Äúdata assets‚Äù that can drive business value.\n\nOrganizations that maximize the productivity of their workforce and enable employees to do their best work\n\nunder optimal conditions are the ones that have the greatest chance to recruit and retain top talent.\n\n**Minimize time in the ‚Äúseam‚Äù**\n\nAs you begin your data transformation, it is important to know that the longer it takes, the more risk and\n\ncost you introduce into your organization. The stepwise approach to migrating your existing data ecosystem\n\nto a modern data stack will require you to operate in two environments simultaneously, the old and the new,\n\nfor some period of time. This will have a series of momentary adverse effects on your business:\n\n\u0007It will increase your operational costs substantially, as you will run two sets of infrastructure\n\n\u0007It will increase your data governance risk, since you will have multiple copies of your data sitting in two\n\nvery different ecosystems\n\n\ntheir work more efficiently, regardless of their\n\npersona or role. The user experience is designed\n\nto support the workloads of data analysts, SQL\n\ndevelopers, data engineers, data scientists and\n\nmachine learning professionals.\n\n\n-----\n\n\u0007It increases the cyberattack footprint and vectors, as the platforms will likely have very different security\n\nmodels and cyber defenses\n\n\u0007It will cause strain on your IT workforce due to the challenges of running multiple environments\n\n\u0007It will require precise communications to ensure that your business partners know which environment to\n\nuse and for what data workloads\n\nTo mitigate some of the strain on the IT workforce, some organizations hire staff augmentation firms to\n\n‚Äúkeep the lights on‚Äù for the legacy systems while the new systems are being implemented and rolled out.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to remember this is a critical but short-lived experience for business continuity.\n\n**Shut down legacy platforms**\n\nIn keeping with the goal of minimizing time in the seam, the project plan and timeline must include the\n\nsteps and sequencing for shutting down legacy platforms. For example, many companies migrate their on-\n\npremises Apache Hadoop data lake to a cloud-based object store. The approach for shutting down the on-\n\npremises Hadoop system is generally as follows:\n\n**1.** \u0007Identify the stakeholders (business and IT) who own the jobs that run in the Hadoop environment.\n\n**2.** \u0007Declare that no changes can be made to the Hadoop environment ‚Äî with the exception of emergency\n\nfixes or absolutely critical new business use cases.\n\n**3.** \u0007Inventory the data flow paths that feed data into the Hadoop environment.\n\n**4.** \u0007Identify the source systems that feed the data.\n\n**5.** \u0007Inventory the data that is currently stored in the Hadoop environment and understand the rate of change.\n\n**6.** \u0007Inventory the software processes (aka jobs) that handle the data and understand the output of the jobs.\n\n**7.** \u0007Determine the downstream consumers of the output from the jobs.\n\n\n-----\n\n**8.** \u0007Prioritize the jobs to move to the modern data architecture.\n\n**9.** \u0007One by one, port the data input, job execution, job output and downstream consumers to the new\n\narchitecture.\n\n**10.** \u0007Run legacy and new jobs in parallel for a set amount of time ‚Äî in order to validate that things are\n\nworking smoothly.\n\n**11.** \u0007Shut down the legacy data feeds, job execution and consumption. Wait. Look for smoke.\n\n**12.** \u0007Rinse and repeat ‚Äî until all jobs are migrated.\n\n**13.** \u0007Shut down the Hadoop cluster.\n\nA similar model can also be applied to legacy on-premises enterprise data warehouses.\n\nYou can follow the same process for other legacy systems in your environment. Some of these systems\n\nmay be more complex and require the participation of more stakeholders to identify the fastest way to\n\nrationalize the data and processes. It is important, however, to make sure that the organization has the\n\nfortitude to hold the line when there is pressure to make changes to the legacy environments or extend\n\ntheir lifespan. Setting firm dates for when these legacy systems will be retired will serve as a forcing function\n\nfor teams when they onboard to the new modern data architecture. Having the executive buy-in from page\n\n9 plays a crucial role in seeing the shutdown of legacy platforms through.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 2. Identify and prioritize use cases\n\nAn important next step in enabling data, analytics and AI to transform your business is to identify use cases\n\nthat drive business value ‚Äî while prioritizing the ones that are achievable under the current conditions\n\n(people, processes, data and infrastructure). There are typically hundreds of use cases within an organization\n\nthat could benefit from better data and AI ‚Äî but not all use cases are of equal importance or feasibility.\n\nLeaders require a systematic approach for identifying, evaluating, prioritizing and implementing use cases.\n\n**Establish the list of potential use cases**\n\nThe first step is to ideate by bringing together various stakeholders from across the organization and\n\nunderstand the overall business drivers ‚Äî especially those that are monitored by the CEO and board of\n\ndirectors. The second step is to identify use case opportunities in collaboration with business stakeholders,\n\nand understand the business processes and the data required to implement the use case. After steps one and\n\ntwo, the next step is to prioritize these cases by calculating the expected ROI. To avoid this becoming a pet\n\nproject within the data/IT teams, it‚Äôs important to have a line of business champion at the executive level.\n\nThere needs to be a balance between use cases that are complex and ones that are considered low-\n\nhanging fruit. For example, determining if a web visitor is an existing or net new customer requires a fairly\n\nstraightforward algorithm that uses web browser cookie data and the correlation of the devices used by a\n\ngiven individual or household. However, developing a sophisticated credit card fraud model that takes into\n\naccount geospatial, temporal, merchant and customer-purchasing behavior requires a broader set of data\n\nto perform the analytics.\n\nIn terms of performance, thought should be given to the speed at which the use case must execute. In\n\ngeneral, the greater the performance, the higher the cost. Therefore, it‚Äôs worth considering grouping use\n\ncases into three categories:\n\n**1.** Sub-second response\n\n**2.** Multi-second response\n\n**3.** Multi-minute response\n\n\n-----\n\nBeing pragmatic about the true service level agreement (SLA) will save time and money by avoiding over-\n\nengineering the design and infrastructure.\n\n**Thinking in terms of ‚Äúdata assets‚Äù**\n\nMachine learning algorithms require data ‚Äî data that is readily available, of high quality and relevant ‚Äî to\n\nperform the experiments, train the models, and then execute the model when it is deployed to production.\n\nThe quality and veracity of the data used to perform these machine learning steps are key to deploying\n\nmodels into production that produce a tangible ROI.\n\nIt is critical to understand what steps are needed in order to make the data available for a given use case.\n\nOne point to consider is to prioritize use cases that make use of similar or adjacent data. If your engineering\n\nteams need to perform work to make data available for one use case, then look for opportunities to have the\n\nengineers do incremental work in order to surface data for adjacent use cases.\n\nMature data and AI companies embrace the concept of ‚Äúdata assets‚Äù or ‚Äúdata products‚Äù to indicate\n\nthe importance of adopting a design strategy and data asset roadmap for the organization. Taking this\n\napproach helps stakeholders avoid fit-for-purpose data sets that drive only a single use case ‚Äî and raise\n\nthe level of thinking to focus on data assets that can fuel many more business functions. The ‚Äúdata asset‚Äù\n\nroadmap helps data source owners understand the priority and complexity of the data assets that need to\n\nbe created. Using this approach, data becomes part of the fabric of the company, evolves the culture, and\n\ninfluences the design of business applications and other systems within the organization.\n\n**Determine the highest impact/priority**\n\nAs shown in Figure 5, organizations can evaluate a given use case using a scorecard approach that takes into\n\naccount three factors: strategic importance, feasibility and tangible ROI. Strategic importance measures\n\nwhether or not the use case helps meet immediate corporate goals and has the potential to drive growth or\n\nreduce risk. Feasibility measures whether or not the organization has the data and IT infrastructure, plus the\n\ndata science talent readily available, to implement the use case. The ROI score indicates whether or not the\n\norganization can easily measure the impact to the P/L.\n\n\n-----\n\n|= Scored by business stakeholders = Scored by technology stakeholders|Col2|SCORING GUIDELINES (RELATIVE SCORING)|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|||1 = LOW SCORE, DO LATER|5 = AVERAGE, NICE TO HAVE|10 = HIGH, MUST HAVE|\n|Strategic Importance Score How important is it to business success?|Business Alignment|Not required for any corporate goals|Not required for immediate corporate goals|Required for immediate corporate goals|\n||Business Driver|Does not drive growth/profitability (P&L) or competitiveness|Could drive some growth/profitability (P&L)|Significantly drives growth/profitability (P&L) and competitiveness|\n||IT Foundation|No BI/IT dependencies|BI/IT best practice|BI/IT foundational element|\n|Feasibility Score What is the current data and AI readiness?|Data Access and Trust Adjusting Based on Availability|Low awareness of available data (internal and external) or the problems it can solve|Some ingestion and exploration of large-scale data is possible|Large-scale data is available for exploration in the cloud|\n||Delivery (Data Engineers, Data Scientists, Data Analysts)|Limited in-house resources|Hiring plan for data science and engineering resources, few available in-house|Scaled data science, engineering, cloud and deployment organization|\n||Architecture|Current thinking on architecture resembles on-prem traditional data warehousing solution with batch processes rather than a data lakehouse approach|Architecture has been built and tested, some use cases are underway with multiple data sources now available in the cloud|The platform is utilized at scale across the business and is able to evolve to meet the demands of new business lines and services driven by data|\n|ROI Score How tangible and large is the ROI?|ROI Potential|Mostly productivity gains, ‚Äúsoft intangible benefits‚Äù|Some P&L impact, not easily tangible|Significant P&L impact, ‚Äúhard measured benefits‚Äù|\n\n\n**Figure 5:**\nMethodology for scoring use cases\n**Ensure business and technology leadership alignment**\n\nPrioritizing use cases requires striking a balance between offensive- and defensive-oriented use cases.\n\nIt is important for executives to evaluate use cases in terms of opportunity growth (offensive) and risk\n\nreduction (defensive). For example, data governance and compliance use cases should take priority\n\nover offensive-oriented use cases when the cost of a data breach or noncompliance is higher than the\n\nacquisition of a new customer.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Databricks Professional Services team can\n\nhelp customers identify revenue-generating and\n\ncost-saving opportunities for data and AI use cases\n\nthat provide a significant ROI when adopting the\n\n\n#### 3. Build successful data teams\n\nIn order to succeed with data, analytics and AI, companies must find and organize the right talent into high-\n\nperforming teams ‚Äî ones that can execute against a well-defined strategy with the proper tools, processes,\n\ntraining and leadership. Digital transformations require executive-level support and are likely to fail without\n\nit ‚Äî especially in large organizations.\n\nHowever, it‚Äôs not enough to simply hire the best data and AI talent ‚Äî the organization must want to succeed, at\n\nan enterprise level. In other words, they must also evolve their company culture into one that embraces data,\n\ndata literacy, collaboration, experimentation and agile principles. We define these companies as ‚Äúdata native.‚Äù\n\n\nlakehouse architecture.\n\n**Chief information officers and chief data officers ‚Äî two sides of the data coin**\n\nData native companies generally have a single, accountable executive who is responsible for areas such\n\nas data science, business analytics, data strategy, data governance and data management. The data\n\nmanagement aspects include registering data sets in a data catalog, tracing data lineage as data sets flow\n\nthrough the environment, performing data quality checks and scanning for sensitive data in the clear.\n\nMany organizations are rapidly adding the chief data officer (CDO) role to their executive ranks in order\n\nto oversee and manage these responsibilities. The CDO works closely with CIOs and other business\n\nstakeholders to establish the overall project plan, design and implementation ‚Äî and to align project\n\nmanagement, product management, business analysis, data engineering, data scientist and machine\n\nlearning talent.\n\nThe CDO and CIO will need to build a broad coalition of support from stakeholders who are incentivized to\n\nmake the transformation a success and help drive organization-wide adoption. To do this, the stakeholders\n\nmust understand the benefits of ‚Äî and their role and responsibilities in ‚Äî supporting the initiative.\n\n\n-----\n\nThere are two organizational constructs that are found in most successful data native companies. The first is\n\nthe creation of an _AI/ML center of excellence_ (COE) that is designed to establish in-house expertise around\n\nML and AI, and which is then used to educate the rest of the organization on best practices. The second is\n\nthe formation of a _data and AI transformation steering committee_ that will oversee and guide decisions and\n\npriorities for the transformative data, analytics and AI initiatives, plus help remove obstacles.\n\nFurthermore, CDOs need to bring their CIOs along early in the journey.\n\n**Creating an AI/ML COE**\n\nData science is a fast-evolving discipline with an ever-growing set of frameworks and algorithms to enable\n\neverything from statistical analysis to supervised learning to deep learning using neural networks. While it is\n\ndifficult to establish specific and exact boundaries between the various disciplines, for the purposes of this\n\ndocument, we use ‚Äúdata science‚Äù as an umbrella term to cover machine learning and artificial intelligence.\n\nHowever, the general distinction is that data science is used to produce insights, machine learning is used to\n\nproduce predictions, and artificial intelligence is used to produce actions. In contrast, while a data scientist\n\nis expected to forecast the future based on past patterns, data analysts extract meaningful insights from\n\nvarious data sources. A data scientist creates questions, while a data analyst finds answers to the existing\n\nset of questions.\n\nOrganizations wanting to build a data science competency should consider hiring talent into a centralized\n\norganization, or COE, for the purposes of establishing the tools, techniques and processes for performing\n\ndata science. The COE works with the rest of the organization to educate and promote the appropriate use\n\nof data science for various use cases.\n\n\n-----\n\nA common approach is to have the COE report into the CDO, but still have data scientists dotted line into\n\nthe business units or department. Using this approach, you achieve two goals:\n\n\u0007The data scientists are closer to the business stakeholders, have a better understanding of the data\n\nwithin a business unit and can help identify use cases that drive value\n\n\u0007Having the data scientists reporting into the CDO provides a structure that encourages collaboration\n\nand consistency in how work is performed among the cohort and brings that to the entire organization\n\n**Data and AI transformation steering committee**\n\nThe purpose of the steering committee is to provide governance and guidance to the data transformation\n\ninitiative. The CDO and CIO should co-chair the committee along with one business executive who can be\n\na vocal advocate and help drive adoption. The level of executive engagement is critical to success of the\n\ninitiative.\n\nThe steering committee should meet regularly with leaders from across the organization to hear status\n\nreports and resolve any conflicts and remove obstacles, if possible. The leaders should represent a broad\n\ngroup of stakeholders, including:\n\n\u0007\n**Program/project management:** To report the status of progress for deploying the new data\n\necosystem and driving adoption through use cases\n\n\u0007\n**Business partners:** To provide insight and feedback on how easy or difficult it is to drive adoption\n\nof the platform\n\n\u0007\n**Engineering:** To report the status of the implementation and what technology trade-offs need\n\nto be made\n\n\u0007\n**Data science:** To report on the progress made by the COE on educating the organization about\n\nuse cases for ML and to report the status of various implementations\n\n\n-----\n\n\u0007\n**InfoSec:** To review the overall security, including network, storage, application and data\n\nencryption and tokenization\n\n\u0007\n**Architecture:** To oversee that the implementation adheres to architectural standards\n\nand guardrails\n\n\u0007\n**Risk, compliance and legal:** To oversee the approach to data governance\n\nand ethics in ML\n\n\u0007\n**User experience:** To serve as the voice of the end users who will perform their jobs using\n\nthe new data ecosystem\n\n\u0007\n**Communication:** To provide up-to-date communications to the organization about next\n\nsteps and how to drive adoption\n\n**Partnering with architecture and InfoSec**\n\nEarly on, the CDO and CIO should engage the engineering and architecture community within the\n\norganization to ensure that everyone understands the technical implications of the overall strategy. This\n\nminimizes the chances that the engineering teams will build separate and competing data platforms. In\n\nregulated industries that require a named enterprise architect (EA), this will be a key relationship to foster.\n\nThe EA is responsible for validating that the overall technology design and data management features\n\nsupport the performance and regulatory compliance requirements ‚Äî specifically, whether the proposed\n\ndesign can meet the anticipated SLAs of the most demanding use cases and support the volume, velocity,\n\nvariety and veracity (four Vs) of the data environment.\n\n\nIt is important to fully understand which\n\nenvironments and accounts your data is stored\n\nin. The goal is to minimize the number of copies of\n\nyour data and to keep the data within your cloud\n\naccount ‚Äî and not the vendor‚Äôs.\n\nMake sure the architecture and security model for\n\nprotecting data is well understood.\n\n\n-----\n\nFrom an InfoSec perspective, the CDO must work to ensure that the proper controls and security are\n\napplied to the new data ecosystem and that the authentication, authorization and access control methods\n\nmeet all the data governance requirements. An industry best practice is to enable self-service registration\n\nof data sets, by the data owner, and support the assignment of security groups or roles to help automate\n\nthe access control process. This allows data sets to be accessible only to the personnel that belong to a\n\ngiven group. The group membership could be based primarily on job function or role within the organization.\n\nThis approach provides fast onboarding of new employees, but caution should be taken not to proliferate\n\ntoo many access control groups ‚Äî in other words, do not get too fine grained with group permissions, as\n\nthey will become increasingly difficult to manage. A better strategy is to be more coarse-grained and use\n\nrow- and column-level security sparingly.\n\n**Centralized vs. federated labor strategy**\n\nIn most organizations today, managers work in silos, making decisions with the best intentions but focused\n\non their own functional areas. The primary risk to the status quo is that there will be multiple competing and\n\nconflicting approaches to creating enterprise data and AI platforms. This duplication of effort will waste time\n\nand money and potentially erode the confidence and motivation of the various teams. While it certainly is\n\nbeneficial to compare and contrast different approaches to implementing an architecture, the approaches\n\nshould be strictly managed, with everyone designing for the same goals and requirements ‚Äî as described in\n\nthis strategy document and adhering to the architectural principles and best practices.\n\nEven still, the roles of the CDO and CIO together should deliver a data analytics and AI platform with the\n\nleast amount of complexity as possible, and one that can easily scale across the organization. It is very\n\nchallenging to merge disparate data platform efforts into a single, cohesive design. It is best to get out\n\nin front of this wave of innovation and take input from the various teams to create a single, centralized\n\nplatform. Having the data engineering teams centralized, reporting into a CIO, makes it easier to design a\n\nmodern data stack ‚Äî while ensuring that there is no duplication of effort when implementing the platform\n\ncomponents. Figure 6 shows one possible structure.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Figure 6:**\nCentralized teams with matrixed responsibilities\n\n\n**Data Scientist**\nModel and predict with data\n\n**Data Analyst**\nVisualize and describe data\n\n\n**Team A ($1.1M)** **Team B ($1.3M)** **Team C ($1.5M)**\n\n**Data Engineer**\nStore, process, maintain data\n\n**Business Partners**\n**and Domain Experts**\n\n\nCentralize data scientists under CDO ‚Äî embed in lines of business for day-to-day tasking\n\nCentralize data engineers under CIO/CTO ‚Äî initially as an enterprise function\n\n**Hiring, training and upskilling your talent**\n\nWhile this guide does not cover recruiting strategies, it is important to note that data engineering and data\n\nscience talent is very difficult to find in this competitive market. As a result, every organization should\n\nconsider what training and upskilling opportunities exist for their current staff. A large number of online\n\ncourses, at relatively low cost, teach the fundamentals of data science and AI. It will still be important to\n\naugment your existing staff with experienced data scientists and machine learning experts. You will then\n\nneed to establish clear training paths, resources and timelines to upskill your talent.\n\nUsing the COE construct, it is easier to upskill a mix of data science talent by having the experts mentor the\n\nless experienced staff. The majority of Ph.D.-level talent comes from academia and has a vested interest\n\nin educating others. It‚Äôs important to set up the structure and allow time in the schedule for knowledge\n\ntransfer, experimentation and a safe environment in which to fail. A key aspect in accelerating the\n\nexperience of your talent is to enable data science using production-like data and creating a collaborative\n\nenvironment for code sharing.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Databricks training, [documentation](https://docs.databricks.com) and\n\n[certification](https://databricks.com/learn/certification) available to customers is industry-\n\nleading, and our [Solution Accelerators](https://databricks.com/solutions/accelerators) provide\n\n\n#### 4. Deploy a modern data stack\n\nThe modern data architecture can most easily be described as the evolution of the enterprise data\n\nwarehouse (EDW) from the 1980s and the Hadoop-style data lakes from the mid-2000s. The capabilities,\n\nlimitations and lessons learned from working with these two legacy data architectures inspired the next\n\ngeneration of data architecture ‚Äî what the industry now refers to as the lakehouse.\n\nFigure 7 shows how the architectures have evolved as networking, storage, memory and CPU performance\n\nhave improved over time.\n\n\nexemplar code for organizations to hit the ground\n\nrunning with data and AI.\n\n**Figure 7:**\nA brief history of data architectures\n\n\n-----\n\n**Evolving beyond the enterprise data warehouse and data lake**\n\nThe EDW provided organizations with the ability to easily load structured and semi-structured data into\n\nwell-organized tables ‚Äî like rows and columns in a spreadsheet ‚Äî and execute Structured Query Language\n\n(SQL) queries and generate business intelligence (BI) reports to measure the health and performance of\n\nthe business. Though the EDW coupled storage and compute, it provided organizations with the ability to\n\ncatalog data, apply robust security and audit, monitor costs and support a large number of simultaneous\n\nusers ‚Äî while still being performant. The EDW served its purpose for decades. However, most of the recent\n\nadvances in AI have been in better models to process unstructured data (text, images, video, audio), but\n\nthese are precisely the types of data that an EDW is not optimized for.\n\nTherefore, in the mid-2000s, organizations wanted to take advantage of new data sets ‚Äî _ones that_\n\n_contained unstructured data_ ‚Äî and apply new analytics ‚Äî _ones that leveraged emerging data science_\n\n_algorithms_ . In order to accomplish this, massive investments in on-premises data lakes occurred ‚Äî most\n\noften leveraging Apache Hadoop and its distributed file system, known as HDFS, running on low-cost,\n\ncommodity hardware. The Hadoop-style data lake provided the separation of compute from storage that\n\norganizations were seeking ‚Äî thus eliminating the risk of vendor lock-in and opening the doors to a wide\n\nrange of new analytics. Despite all these benefits, the architecture proved to be difficult to use, with a\n\ncomplex programming model known as MapReduce, and the performance fell short of the majority of real-\n\ntime use cases.\n\nOver time, Hadoop workloads were often migrated to Apache Spark‚Ñ¢ workloads, which run 100x faster by\n\nprocessing data in-memory across a cluster ‚Äî with the ability to massively scale. The Spark programming\n\nmodel was also simpler to use and provided a consistent set of application programming interfaces (APIs)\n\nfor languages such as Python, SQL, R, Java and Scala. Spark was the first major step in separating compute\n\nfrom storage and providing the scale needed for distributed workloads.\n\n\n-----\n\nA data lakehouse combines the best of data\n\n\n**Cloud-based data lakes**\n\nMore than a decade ago, the cloud opened a new frontier for data storage. Cloud object stores like\n\nAmazon S3 and Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) have become some of the largest, most cost-effective\n\nstorage systems in the world ‚Äî which make them an attractive platform to serve as the next generation\n\nof data lakes. Object stores excel at massively parallel reads ‚Äî an essential requirement for modern data\n\nwarehouses.\n\n\nlakes and data warehouses, enabling BI and ML\n\n\nHowever, data lakes lack some critical features: They do not support transactions, they do not enforce\n\ndata quality, and their lack of consistency/isolation makes it almost impossible to mix appends and reads,\n\nand batch and streaming jobs. Also, performance is hampered by expensive metadata operations ‚Äî for\n\nexample, efficiently listing the millions of files (objects) that make up most large data lakes.\n\n**Lakehouse ‚Äî the modern data architecture**\n\nWhat if it were possible to combine the best of both worlds? The performance, concurrency and data\n\nmanagement of EDWs with the scalability, low cost and workload flexibility of the data lake. This is exactly\n\nthe target architecture described by CDOs, CIOs and CTOs when asked how they would envision reducing\n\nthe complexity of their current data ecosystems while enabling data and AI, at scale. The building blocks\n\nof this architecture are shown in Figure 8 and are what inspired the innovations that make the lakehouse\n\narchitecture possible.\n\n\non all data on a simple, open and multicloud\n\nmodern data stack.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Exploratory Data Scientist**\n\n\n**Production Machine Learning** **BI/Ad Hoc SQL Analytics**\n\n\n**Curated Data Lake**\n\n\n**Raw Data Ingest**\n‚ÄúBronze‚Äù\n\n\n**Filtered/Cleaned/Augmented**\n‚ÄúSilver‚Äù\n\n\n**Business-Level Aggregates**\n‚ÄúGold‚Äù\n\n\n**D ATA Q U A L I T Y**\n\n**Data Sources (Batch and Real-Time)**\n\n\n**Unstructured**\n\n-  Image, Video, Audio\n\n-  Free Text, Blob\n\n\n**Semi-Structured**\n\n-  Logs, Clickstream\n\n-  CSV, JSON, XML\n\n\n**Structured**\n\n-  Systems of Record\n\n-  Operational DBs\n\n\n**Figure 8:**\nThe building blocks for a modern data architecture\n\nThe lakehouse architecture provides a flexible, high-performance design for diverse data applications,\n\nincluding real-time streaming, batch processing, data warehousing, data science and machine learning. This\n\ntarget-state architecture supports loading all the data types that might be interesting to an organization ‚Äî\n\nstructured, semi-structured and unstructured ‚Äî and provides a single processing layer, using consistent\n\nAPIs across programming languages, to curate data while applying rigorous data management techniques.\n\nThe move toward a single, consistent approach to data pipelining and refinement saves organizations\n\ntime, money and duplication of effort. Data arrives in a landing zone and is then moved through a series of\n\ncuration and refinement steps resulting in highly consumable and trusted data for downstream use cases.\n\nThe architecture makes possible the efficient creation of ‚Äúdata assets‚Äù for the organization by taking a\n\nstepwise approach to improving data.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Lakehouse key features**\n\nTo effectively migrate organizations to the lakehouse architecture, here‚Äôs a list of key features that must be\n\navailable for stakeholders to run business-critical production workloads:\n\n\u0007 **Reliable data pipelines:** The lakehouse architecture simplifies the ETL development and\n\nmanagement with declarative pipeline development, automatic data testing and deep visibility for\n\nmonitoring and recovery.\n\n\u0007 **Transaction support:** In an enterprise lakehouse, many data pipelines will often be reading and writing\n\ndata concurrently. Support for ACID transactions ensures consistency as multiple parties concurrently\n\nread or write data, typically using SQL.\n\n\u0007 **Schema enforcement and governance:** The lakehouse should have a way to support schema enforcement\n\nand evolution, supporting DW schema paradigms such as star/snowflake schemas. The system should\n\nbe able to reason about data integrity, and it should have robust governance and auditing mechanisms.\n\n\u0007 **Fine-grained governance for data and AI:** The first fine-grained, centralized security model for data\n\nlakes across clouds ‚Äî based on the ANSI SQL open standards. The lakehouse enables organizations\n\nto unify data and AI assets by centrally sharing, auditing, securing and managing structured and\n\nunstructured data like tables, files, models and dashboards in concert with existing data, storage and\n\ncatalogs.\n\n\u0007 **Storage is decoupled from compute:** In practice this means storage and compute use separate\n\nclusters, thus these systems are able to scale to many more concurrent users and larger data sizes.\n\nSome modern data warehouses also have this property.\n\n\u0007 **Openness:** The storage formats they use are open and standardized, such as Parquet, and they provide\n\nan API so a variety of tools and engines, including machine learning and Python/R libraries, can efficiently\n\naccess the data directly.\n\n\nDatabricks released Delta Lake to the open source\n\ncommunity in 2019. Delta Lake provides all the data\n\nlifecycle management functions that are needed\n\nto make cloud-based object stores reliable and\n\nperformant. This design allows clients to update\n\nmultiple objects at once, replace a subset of\n\nthe objects with another, etc., in a serializable\n\nmanner that still achieves high parallel read/write\n\nperformance from the objects ‚Äî while offering\n\nadvanced capabilities like time travel (e.g., query\n\npoint-in-time snapshots or rollback of erroneous\n\nupdates), automatic data layout optimization,\n\nupserts, caching and audit logs.\n\n\n-----\n\n\u0007 **Support for diverse data types ranging from unstructured to structured data:** The lakehouse can be\n\nused to store, refine, analyze and access data types needed for many new data applications, including\n\nimages, video, audio, semi-structured data and text.\n\n\u0007 **Support for diverse workloads:** This includes data science, machine learning, SQL and analytics. Multiple\n\ntools might be needed to support all these workloads, but they all rely on the same data repository.\n\n\u0007 **End-to-end streaming:** Real-time reports are the norm in many enterprises. Support for streaming\n\neliminates the need for separate systems dedicated to serving real-time data applications.\n\n\u0007 **BI support:** Lakehouses enable the use of BI tools directly on the source data. This reduces staleness,\n\nimproves recency, reduces latency and lowers the cost of having to operationalize two copies of the\n\ndata in both a data lake and a warehouse.\n\n\u0007 **Multicloud:** The Databricks Lakehouse Platform offers you a consistent management, security and\n\ngovernance experience across all clouds. You don‚Äôt need to invest in reinventing processes for every\n\ncloud platform that you‚Äôre using to support your data and AI efforts. Instead, your data teams can simply\n\nfocus on putting all your data to work to discover new insights and create business value.\n\n\n###### Lakehouse Platform\n\n\nData\nWarehousing\n\n\nData\nEngineering\n\n\nData\nStreaming\n\n\nData SÔøΩienÔøΩÔøΩ\nand ML\n\n\nUnity Catalog\nFine-grained governance for data and AI\n\nDelta Lake\nData relia)ility and .erfor2ance\n\nCloud Data Lake\nAll structured and unstructured data\n\n\n**Figure 9:**\nDelta Lake is the open data storage layer that delivers reliability,\nsecurity and performance on your data lake ‚Äî for both\nstreaming and batch operations\n\n\n-----\n\nThese are the key attributes of lakehouses. Enterprise-grade systems require additional features. Tools\n\nfor security and access control are basic requirements. Data governance capabilities, including auditing,\n\nretention and lineage, have become essential, particularly in light of recent privacy regulations. Tools that\n\nenable data discovery such as data catalogs and data usage metrics are also needed. With a lakehouse,\n\nsuch enterprise features only need to be implemented, tested and administered for a single system.\n\nDatabricks is the only cloud-native vendor\n\n\n**Databricks ‚Äî innovation driving performance**\n\nAdvanced analytics and machine learning on unstructured and large-scale data are two of the most\n\nstrategic priorities for enterprises today ‚Äî and the growth of unstructured data is going to increase\n\nexponentially ‚Äî so it makes sense for CIOs and CDOs to think about positioning their data lake as the\n\ncenter of their data infrastructure. The main challenge is whether or not it can perform reliably and fast\n\nenough to meet the SLAs of the various workloads ‚Äî especially SQL-based analytics.\n\nDatabricks has focused its engineering efforts on incorporating a wide range of industry-leading software\n\nand hardware improvements in order to implement the first lakehouse solution. Our approach capitalizes\n\non the computing advances of the Apache Spark framework and the latest networking, storage and CPU\n\ntechnologies to provide the performance customers need to simplify their architecture. These innovations\n\ncombine to provide a single architecture that can store and process all the data sets within an organization ‚Äî\n\nsupporting the range of analytics outlined above.\n\n**BI and SQL workloads**\n\nPerhaps the most significant challenge for the lakehouse architecture is the ability to support SQL queries\n\nfor star/snowflake schemas in support of BI workloads. Part of the reason EDWs have remained a major\n\npart of the data ecosystem is because they provide low-latency, high-concurrency query support. In order\n\nto compete with the EDW, optimizations must be found within the lakehouse architecture that provide\n\nsatisfactory query performance for the majority of BI workloads. Fortunately, advances in query plan, query\n\nexecution, statistical analysis of files in the object store, and hardware and software improvements make it\n\npossible to deliver on this promise.\n\n\nto be recognized as a Leader in both\n\n[2021 Magic Quadrant reports:](https://databricks.com/p/ebook/databricks-named-leader-by-gartner)\n\n**Cloud Database Management Systems** and\n\n**Data Science and Machine Learning Platforms**\n\n\n-----\n\n**A word about the data mesh architecture**\n\nIn 2019, another architectural concept, called the data mesh, was introduced. This architecture addresses\n\nwhat some designers identify as weaknesses of a centralized data lake. Namely, that you fill the data lake\n\nusing a series of extract, transform, load (ETL) processes ‚Äî which unnecessarily adds complexity. The data\n\nmesh approach avoids centralizing data in one location and encourages the source systems to create\n\n‚Äúdata products‚Äù or ‚Äúdata assets‚Äù that are served up directly to consumers for data and AI workloads. The\n\ndesigners advocate for a federated approach to data and AI ‚Äî while using enterprise policies to govern how\n\nsource systems make data assets available.\n\nThere are several challenges with this approach. First, the data mesh assumes that each source system\n\ncan dynamically scale to meet the demands of the consumers ‚Äî particularly challenging when data assets\n\nbecome ‚Äúhot spots‚Äù within the ecosystem. Second, centralized policies oftentimes leave the implementation\n\ndetails to the individual teams. This has the potential of inconsistent implementations, which may lead to\n\nperformance degradations and differing cost profiles. Finally, the data mesh approach assumes that each\n\nsource system team has the necessary skills, or can acquire them, to build robust data products.\n\nThe lakehouse architecture is not at odds with the data mesh philosophy ‚Äî as ingesting higher-quality data\n\nfrom the source systems reduces the curation steps needed inside the data lake itself.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 5. Improve data governance and compliance\n\nData governance is perhaps the most challenging aspect of data transformation initiatives. Every\n\nstakeholder recognizes the importance of making data readily available, of high quality and relevant to help\n\ndrive business value. Likewise, organizations understand the risks of failing to get it right ‚Äî the potential for\n\nundetected data breaches, negative impact on the brand and the potential for significant fines in regulated\n\nenvironments. However, organizations shouldn‚Äôt perceive data governance or a defensive data strategy as\n\na blocker or deterrent to business value. In fact, many organizations have leveraged their strong stance on\n\ndata governance as a competitive differentiator to earn and maintain customer trust, ensure sound data\n\nand privacy practices, and protect their data assets\n\n**Why data governance fails**\n\nWhile most people agree that data governance is a set of principles, practices and tooling that helps\n\nmanage the complete lifecycle of your data, what is often not discussed is what constitutes a pragmatic\n\napproach ‚Äî one that balances realistic policies with automation and scalability.\n\nToo often the policies developed around data governance define very strict data management principles ‚Äî\n\nfor example, the development of an enterprise-wide ontological model that all data must adhere to.\n\nOrganizations can spend months, if not years, trying to define the perfect set of policies. The engineering\n\neffort to automate the enforcement of the new policies is not prioritized, or takes too long, due to the\n\ncomplexity of the requirements. Meanwhile, data continues to flow through the organization without a\n\nconsistent approach to governance, and too much of the effort is done manually and fraught with human error.\n\n\nWhat are the basic building blocks of a sound data\n\ngovernance approach?\n\n\n-----\n\n**A pragmatic approach to data governance**\n\nAt a high level, organizations should enable the following data management capabilities:\n\n**\u0007Identify all sources of data**\n\n\u0007Identify all data-producing and data-storing applications\n\n\u0007Identify the systems of record (SOR) for each data set\n\n\u0007Label data sets as internal or external (third party)\n\n\u0007Identify where sensitive data is stored ‚Äî GDPR/CCPA scope\n\n\u0007Limit which operational data stores (ODSs) can re-store SOR data\n\n**\u0007Catalog data sets**\n\n\u0007Register all data sets in a centralized data catalog\n\n\u0007Create a lightweight, self-service data registration process\n\n\u0007Limit manual entry as much as possible\n\n\u0007Record the schema, if any, for the data set\n\n\u0007Use an inference engine or tool to extract the data set schema\n\n\u0007Add business and technical metadata to make it meaningful\n\n\u0007Use machine learning to classify data sets\n\n\u0007Use crowdsourcing to validate the machine-based results\n\n**Track data lineage**\n\n\u0007Track data set flow and what systems act on data\n\n\u0007Create an enumerated list of action values for specific operations\n\n\u0007Emit lineage events via streaming layer and aggregate in data lake lineage event schema:\n\n<data setID, systemID, action, timestamp>\n\n\u0007Optional: Add a source code repository URL for action traceability\n\n\n-----\n\n**\u0007Perform data quality checks**\n\n\u0007Create a rules library that is centrally managed and versioned\n\n\u0007Update the rules library periodically with new rules\n\n\u0007Use a combination of checks ‚Äî null/not null, regex, valid values\n\n\u0007Perform schema enforcement checks against data set registration\n\nBy minimizing the number of copies of your data\n\n\n**\u0007Scan for sensitive data**\n\n\u0007Establish a tokenization strategy for sensitive data ‚Äî GDPR/CCPA\n\n\u0007Tokenize all sensitive data stored in the data lake ‚Äî avoid cleartext\n\n\u0007Use fixed-length tokens to preserve analytic value\n\n\u0007Determine the approach for token lookup/resolution when needed\n\n\u0007Ensure that any central token stores are secure with rotating keys\n\n\u0007Identify which data elements from GDPR/CCPA to include in scans\n\n\u0007Efficiently scan for sensitive data in cleartext using the rules library\n\n**\u0007Establish approved data flow patterns**\n\n\u0007Determine pathways for data flow (source ‚Äî> target)\n\n\u0007Limit the ways to get SOR data (APIs, streaming, data lake, etc.)\n\n\u0007Determine read/write patterns for the data lake\n\n\u0007Strictly enforce data flow pathways to/from data lake\n\n\u0007Detect violations and anomalies using lineage event analysis\n\n\u0007Identify offending systems and shut down or grant exception\n\n\u0007Record data flow exceptions and set a remediation deadline\n\n**\u0007Centralize data access controls**\n\n\u0007Establish a common governance model for all data and AI assets\n\n\u0007Centrally define access policies for all data and AI assets\n\n\u0007Enable fine-grained access controls at row and column levels\n\n\u0007Centrally enforce access policies across all workloads ‚Äî BI, analytics, ML\n\n\nand moving to a single data processing layer where\n\nall your data governance controls can run together,\n\nyou improve your chances of staying in compliance\n\nand detecting a data breach.\n\n\n-----\n\n**\u0007Make data discovery easy**\n\n\u0007Establish a data discovery model\n\n\u0007Use manual or automatic data classification\n\n\u0007Provide a visual interface for data discovery across your data estate\n\n\u0007Simplify data discovery with rich keyword- or business glossary-based search\n\n**\u0007Centralize data access auditing**\n\n\u0007Establish a framework or best practices for access auditing\n\n\u0007Capture audit logs for all CRUD operations performed on data\n\n\u0007Make auditing reports easily accessible to data stewards/admins for ensuring compliance\n\nThis is not intended to be an exhaustive list of features and requirements but rather a framework to\n\nevaluate your data governance approach. There will be violations at runtime, so it will be important to have\n\nprocedures in place for how to handle these violations. In some cases, you may want to be very strict and\n\nshut down the data flow of the offending system. In other cases, you may want to quarantine the data until\n\nthe offending system is fixed. Finally, some SLAs may require the data to flow regardless of a violation. In\n\nthese cases, the receiving systems must have their own methodology for dealing with bad data.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Hidden cost of data governance**\n\nThere are numerous examples of high-profile data breaches and failure to comply with consumer data\n\nprotection legislation. You don‚Äôt have to look very far to see reports of substantial fines levied against\n\norganizations that were not able to fully protect the data within their data ecosystem. As organizations\n\nproduce and collect more and more data, it‚Äôs important to remember that while storage is cheap, failing\n\nto enforce proper data governance is very, very expensive.\n\nIn order to catalog, lineage trace, quality check, and scan your data effectively, you will need a lot of\n\ncompute power when you consider the massive amounts of data that exist in your organization. Each\n\ntime you copy a piece of data to load it into another tool or platform, you need to determine what data\n\ngovernance techniques exist there and how you ensure that you truly know where all your data resides.\n\nImagine the scenario where data flows through your environment and is loaded into multiple platforms\n\nusing various ETL processes. How do you handle the situation when you discover that sensitive data is\n\nin cleartext? Without a consistent set of data governance tools, you may not be able to remediate the\n\nproblem before it‚Äôs flagged for violation.\n\nHaving a smaller attack surface and fewer ingress/egress routes helps guard your data and protect your\n\norganization‚Äôs brand and balance sheet.\n\nThe bottom line is that the more complex your data ecosystem architecture is, the more difficult and costly\n\nit is to get data governance right.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 6. Democratize access to quality data\n\nEffective data and AI solutions rely more on the amount of quality data available than on the sophistication\n\nor complexity of the model or algorithm. Google published a paper titled ‚ÄúThe Unreasonable Effectiveness of\n\nData‚Äù demonstrating this point. The takeaway is that organizations should focus their efforts on making sure\n\ndata scientists have access to the widest selection of relevant and high-quality data to perform their jobs ‚Äî\n\nwhich is to create new opportunities for revenue growth, cost reduction and risk reduction.\n\n**The 80/20 data science dilemma**\n\nMost existing data environments have their data stored primarily in different operational data stores within a\n\ngiven business unit (BU) ‚Äî creating several challenges:\n\n\u0007Most business units deploy use cases that are based only on their own data ‚Äî without taking advantage\n\nof cross-BU opportunities\n\n\u0007The schemas are generally not well understood outside of BU or department ‚Äî with only the database\n\ndesigners and power users being able to make efficient use of the data. This is referred to as the ‚Äútribal\n\nknowledge‚Äù phenomenon.\n\n\u0007The approval process and different system-level security models make it difficult and time-consuming\n\nfor data scientists to gain the proper access to the data they need\n\nIn order to perform analysis, users are forced to log in to multiple systems to collect their data. This is most\n\noften done using single-node data science and generates unnecessary copies of data stored on local disk\n\ndrives, various network shares or user-controlled cloud storage. In some cases, the data is copied to ‚Äúuser\n\nspaces‚Äù within production platform environments. This has the strong potential of degrading the overall\n\nperformance for true production workloads.\n\nTo make matters worse, these copies of data are generally much smaller than the full-size data sets that would\n\nbe needed in order to get the best model performance for your ML and AI workloads.\n\n\n-----\n\nSmall data sets reduce the effectiveness of exploration, experimentation, model development and model\n\ntraining ‚Äî resulting in inaccurate models when deployed into production and used with full-size data sets.\n\nAs a result, data science teams are spending 80% of their time wrangling data sets and only 20% of their\n\ntime performing analytic work ‚Äî work that may need to be redone once they have access to the full-size\n\ndata sets. This is a serious problem for organizations that want to remain competitive and generate game-\n\nchanging results.\n\nAnother factor contributing to reduced productivity is the way in which end users are typically granted\n\naccess to data. Security policies usually require both coarse-grained and fine-grained data protections.\n\nIn other words, granting access at a data set level but limiting access to specific rows and columns (fine-\n\ngrained) within the data set.\n\n**Rationalize data access roles**\n\nThe most common approach to providing coarse-grained and fine-grained access is to use what‚Äôs known\n\nas role-based access control (RBAC). Individual users log on to system-level accounts or via a single sign-on\n\n(SSO) authentication and access control solution.\n\nUsers can access data by being added to one or more Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) groups.\n\nThere are different strategies for identifying and creating these groups ‚Äî but typically, they are done on a\n\nsystem-by-system basis, with a 1:1 mapping for each coarse- and fine-grained access control combination.\n\nThis approach to data access usually produces a proliferation of user groups. It is not unusual to see several\n\nthousand discrete security groups for large organizations ‚Äî despite having a much smaller number of\n\ndefined job functions.\n\nThis approach creates one of the biggest security challenges in large organizations. When personnel leave\n\nthe company, it is fairly straightforward to remove them from the various security groups. However, when\n\npersonnel move around within the organization, their old security group assignments often remain intact\n\nand new ones are assigned based on their new job function. This leads to personnel continuing to have\n\naccess to data that they no longer have a ‚Äúneed to know.‚Äù\n\n\nThe Databricks Lakehouse Platform brings together\n\nall the data and AI personas into one environment\n\nand makes it easy to collaborate, share code and\n\ninsights, and operate against the same view of data.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Data classification**\n\nHaving all your data sets stored in a single, well-managed data lake gives you the ability to use partition\n\nstrategies to segment your data based on ‚Äúneed to know.‚Äù Some organizations create a partition based\n\non which business unit owns the data and which one owns the data classification. For example, in a\n\nfinancial services company, credit card customers‚Äô data could be stored separately from that of debit card\n\ncustomers, and access to GDPR/CCPA-related fields could be handled using classification labels.\n\nThe simplest approach to data classification is to use three labels:\n\n\u0007 **Public data:** Data that can be freely disclosed to the public. This would include your annual report, press\n\nreleases, etc.\n\n\u0007 **Internal data:** Data that has low security requirements but should not be shared with the public or\n\ncompetitors. This would include strategy briefings and market or customer segmentation research.\n\n\u0007 **Restricted data:** Highly sensitive data regarding customers or internal business operations. Disclosure\n\ncould negatively affect operations and put the organization at financial or legal risk. Restricted data\n\nrequires the highest level of security protection.\n\nSome organizations introduce additional labels, but care should be taken to make sure that everyone clearly\n\nunderstands how to apply them.\n\nThe data classification requirements should be clearly documented and mapped to any legal or regulatory\n\nrequirements. For example, CCPA is so sweeping that it includes 11 categories of personal information ‚Äî\n\nand defines ‚Äúpersonal information‚Äù as ‚Äúinformation that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of\n\nbeing associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or\n\nhousehold.‚Äù\n\n\n-----\n\nJust examining one CCPA category, _Customer Records Information_ , we see that the following information is\n\nto be protected: name, signature, social security number, physical characteristics or description, address,\n\ntelephone number, passport number, driver‚Äôs license or state identification card number, insurance policy\n\nnumber, education, employment, employment history, bank account number, credit or debit card number,\n\nother financial information, medical information, and health insurance information.\n\nThere are generally three different approaches in industry to performing data classification:\n\n**1. \u0007Content-based:** Scans or inspects and interprets files to find sensitive information. This is generally\n\ndone using regular expressions and lookup tables to map values to actual entities stored inside the\n\norganization (e.g., customer SSN).\n\n**2. \u0007Context-based:** Evaluates the source of the data (e.g., application, location or creator) to determine\n\nthe sensitivity of the data.\n\n**3. \u0007User-based:** Relies on a manual, end-user selection of each data set or element and requires expert\n\ndomain knowledge to ensure accuracy.\n\nTaking all this into account, an organization could implement a streamlined set of roles for RBAC that\n\nuses the convention <domain><entity><data set | data asset><classification> where ‚Äúdomain‚Äù might be the\n\nbusiness unit within an organization, ‚Äúentity‚Äù is the noun that the role is valid for, ‚Äúdata set‚Äù or ‚Äúdata asset‚Äù is\n\nthe ID, and ‚Äúclassification‚Äù is one of the three values (public, internal, restricted).\n\nThere is a ‚Äúdeny all default‚Äù policy that does not allow access to any data unless there is a corresponding\n\nrole assignment. Wild cards can be used to grant access to eliminate the need to enumerate every\n\ncombination.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor example, <credit-card><customers><transactions> <restricted> gives a user or a system access to all the\n\ndata fields that describe a credit card transaction for a customer, including the 16-digit credit card number.\n\nWhereas <credit-card><customers><transactions><role><membership> would allow the user or system\n\naccess only to nonsensitive data regarding the transaction.\n\nThis gives organizations the chance to rationalize their security groups by using a domain naming\n\nconvention to provide coarse-grained and fine-grained access without the need for creating tons of LDAP\n\ngroups. It also dramatically eases the administration of granting access to data for a given user.\n\n**Everyone working from the same view of data**\n\nThe modern data stack, when combined with a simplified security group approach and a robust data\n\ngovernance methodology, gives organizations an opportunity to rethink how data is accessed ‚Äî and greatly\n\nimproves time to market for their analytic use cases. All analytic workloads can now operate from a single,\n\nshared view of your data.\n\nCombining this with a sensitive data tokenization strategy can make it straightforward to empower data\n\nscientists to do their job and shift the 80/20 ratio in their favor. It‚Äôs now easier to work with full-size data\n\nsets that both obfuscate NPI/PII information and preserve analytic value.\n\nNow, data discovery is easier because data sets have been registered in the catalog with full descriptions\n\nand business metadata ‚Äî with some organizations going as far as showing realistic sample data for a\n\nparticular data set. If a user does not have access to the underlying data files, having data in one physical\n\nlocation eases the burden of granting access, and then it‚Äôs easier to deploy access-control policies and\n\ncollect/analyze audit logs to monitor data usage and to look for bad actors.\n\n\nAdopting the Databricks Lakehouse Platform allows\n\nyou to add data sets into a well-managed data lake\n\nusing low-cost object stores, and makes it easy to\n\npartition data based on domain, entity, data set and\n\nclassification levels to provide fine-grained (row-\n\nlevel and column-level) security.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Data security, validation and curation ‚Äî in one place**\n\nThe modern data architecture using Databricks Lakehouse makes it easy to take a consistent approach to\n\nprotecting, validating and improving your organization‚Äôs data. Data governance policies can be enforced\n\nusing the built-in features of schema validation, expectations and pipelines ‚Äî the three main steps to data\n\ncuration. Databricks enables moving data through well-defined states: Raw ‚Äî> Refined ‚Äî> Curated or, as we\n\nrefer to it at Databricks, Bronze ‚Äî> Silver ‚Äî> Gold.\n\nThe raw data is known as ‚ÄúBronze-level‚Äù data and serves as the landing zone for all your important analytic\n\ndata. Bronze data functions as the starting point for a series of curation steps that filter, clean and augment\n\nthe data for use by downstream systems. The first major refinement results in data being stored in ‚ÄúSilver-\n\nlevel‚Äù tables within the data lake. These tables carry all the benefits of the Delta Lake product ‚Äî for example,\n\nACID transactions and time travel. The final step in the process is to produce business-level aggregates, or\n\n‚ÄúGold-level‚Äù tables, that combine data sets from across the organization. It‚Äôs a set of data used to improve\n\ncustomer service across the full line of products, perform GDPR/CCPA reporting or look for opportunities to\n\ncross-sell to increase customer retention. For the first time, organizations can truly optimize data curation\n\nand ETL ‚Äî eliminating unnecessary copies of data and the duplication of effort that often happens in ETL\n\njobs with legacy data ecosystems. This ‚Äúsolve once, access many times‚Äù approach speeds time to market,\n\nimproves the user experience and helps retain talent.\n\n**Extend the impact of your data with secure data sharing**\n\nData sharing is crucial to drive business value in today‚Äôs digital economy. More and more organizations\n\nare now looking to securely share trusted data with their partners/suppliers, internal lines of business or\n\ncustomers to drive collaboration, improve internal efficiency and generate new revenue streams with data\n\nmonetization. Additionally, organizations are interested in leveraging external data to drive new product\n\ninnovations and services.\n\nBusiness executives must establish and promote a data sharing culture in their organizations to build\n\ncompetitive advantage.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 7. Dramatically increase productivity of your workforce\n\nNow that you have deployed a modern data stack and have landed all your analytical data in a well-\n\nmanaged data lake with a rationalized approach to access control, the next question is, ‚ÄúWhat tools should I\n\nprovide to the user community so they can be most effective at using the new data ecosystem?‚Äù\n\n**Design thinking: working backward from the user experience**\n\nDesign thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation ‚Äî focused on understanding customer needs,\n\nrapid prototyping and generating creative ideas ‚Äî that will transform the way you develop products, services,\n\nprocesses and organizations. Design thinking was introduced as a technique to not only improve but also\n\nbring joy to the way people work. The essence of design thinking is to determine what motivates people to\n\ndo their job, where their current pain points are and what could be improved to make their jobs enjoyable.\n\n**Moving beyond best of breed**\n\nIf you look across a large enterprise, you will find no shortage of database design, ETL, data cleansing, model\n\ntraining and model deployment tools. Many organizations take a ‚Äúbest of breed‚Äù approach in providing\n\ntooling for their end users. This typically occurs because leaders genuinely want to empower business\n\nunits, departments and teams to select the tool that best suits their specific needs ‚Äî so-called federated\n\ntool selection. Data science tooling, in particular, tends not to be procured at the ‚Äúenterprise‚Äù level at first ‚Äî\n\ngiven the high cost of rolling it out to the entire user population.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhen tool selection becomes localized, there are a few things to consider:\n\n\u0007Tools are generally thought of as discrete components within an ecosystem and, therefore,\n\ninterchangeable with criteria that are established within a specific tool category. The tool with the best\n\noverall score gets selected.\n\n\u0007The selection criteria for a tool usually contains a subjective list of ‚Äúmust-have‚Äù features based on\n\npersonal preference or adoption within a department, or because a given tool is better suited to support\n\na current business process\n\n\u0007Discrete tools tend to leapfrog one another and add features based on market demand rather quickly\n\n\u0007Evaluations that are performed over many months likely become outdated by the time the tool has\n\nmoved into production\n\n\u0007The ‚Äúenterprise‚Äù requirements are often limited to ensuring that the tool fits into the overall architecture\n\nand security environment but nothing more\n\n\u0007It‚Äôs rare that the tools are evaluated in terms of simplifying the overall architecture, reducing the number\n\nof tools in play or streamlining the user experience\n\n\u0007The vendor backing the tool is evaluated in terms of risk, but not enough focus is spent on the\n\npartnership model, the ability to influence the roadmap and professional services support\n\nFor these reasons and more, it‚Äôs worth considering an architecture and procurement strategy that centers\n\non selecting a data platform that enables seamless integration with point solutions rather than a suite of\n\ndiscrete tools that require integration work and may no longer be category leaders over the long haul.\n\n\n-----\n\nDatabricks is a leading data and AI company ‚Äî\n\n\nKeep in mind that data platforms work well because the vendor took an opinionated point of view of how\n\ndata processing, validation and curation should work. It‚Äôs the integration between the discrete functions\n\nof the platform that saves time, conserves effort and improves the user experience. Many companies try\n\nto take on the integration of different technology stacks, which increases risk, cost and complexity. The\n\nconsequences of not doing the integration properly can be serious ‚Äî in terms of security, compliance,\n\nefficiency, cost, etc.\n\n\npartly due to the innovations in the [open source](https://databricks.com/product/open-source)\n\n\nSo, find a vendor that you can develop a true partnership with ‚Äî one that is more likely to take feedback\n\nand incorporate your requirements into their platform product roadmap. This will require some give-and-\n\ntake from both parties ‚Äî sometimes calling for an organization to adjust their processes to better fit how\n\nthe platform works. There are many instances where a given business process could be simplified or recast\n\nto work with the platform, as is. Sometimes it will require the vendor to add features that support your\n\nprocesses. The vendor will always be market driven and will want to build features in such a way that they\n\napply to the broadest set of customers.\n\nThe final point to consider is that it takes a substantial amount of time to become an expert user of a given\n\ntool. Users must make a significant investment to learn how the tool works and the most efficient way of\n\nperforming their job. The more discrete tools in an environment, the more challenging this becomes.\n\nMinimizing the number of tools and their different interfaces, styles of interaction and approach to security\n\nand collaboration helps improve the user experience and decreases time to market.\n\n\n[software](https://databricks.com/product/open-source) that runs our platform ‚Äî and as a result of\n\nlistening to the needs of thousands of customers\n\nand having our engineers work side by side with\n\ncustomer teams to deliver real business value using\n\ndata and AI.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Unified platform, unified personas**\n\nDeploying a unified data platform ‚Äî like the Databricks Lakehouse Platform, which implements a modern\n\ndata stack ‚Äî will provide an integrated suite of tools for the full range of personas in your organization,\n\nincluding business analysts, SQL developers, data engineers and data scientists. You will immediately\n\nincrease productivity and reduce risk because you‚Äôll be better able to share the key aspects of data\n\npipelining ‚Äî including ingestion, partitioning, curation, SQL analytics, reporting, and model development\n\nand deployment. All the work streams function off a single view of the data, and the handoffs between\n\nsubsystems are well managed.\n\nData processing happens in one auditable environment, and the number of copies of data is kept to an\n\nabsolute minimum ‚Äî with each user benefiting from the data assets created by others. Redundant work\n\nis eliminated.\n\nThe 80/20 dilemma for data scientists shifts to a healthier ratio, and they now are able to spend more time\n\nworking with rather than collecting the data. It‚Äôs difficult to decide what algorithm will work best ‚Äî shifting\n\nthe 80/20 ratio allows the data scientist to try out multiple algorithms to solve a problem.\n\nAnother challenge is that enterprise data changes rapidly. New fields are added or existing fields are typed\n\ndifferently ‚Äî for example, changing a string to an integer. This has a cascading effect, and the downstream\n\nconsumers must be able to adjust by monitoring the execution and detecting the changes. The data\n\nscientist, in turn, must update and test new models on the new data. Your data platform should make the\n\ndetection and remediation easier, not harder.\n\nFor the data engineers, their primary focus is extracting data from source systems and moving it into the\n\nnew data ecosystem. The data pipeline function can be simplified with a unified data platform because\n\nthe programming model and APIs are consistent across programming languages (e.g., Scala, Python). This\n\nresults in improved operations and maintenance (O&M). The runtime environment is easier to troubleshoot\n\nand debug since the compute layer is consistent, and the logging and auditing associated with the data\n\nprocessing and data management is centralized and of more value.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Maximize the productivity of your workforce**\n\nOnce you have a data platform that brings together your full range of personas, you should focus on the\n\nnext step for increasing productivity ‚Äî namely, self-service environments.\n\nIn large organizations, there needs to be a strategy for how solutions are promoted up through the runtime\n\nenvironments for development, testing and production. These environments need to be nearly identical to\n\none another ‚Äî using the same version of software while limiting the number, size and horsepower of the\n\ncompute nodes. To the extent possible, development and test should be performed with realistic test/\n\nsynthetic data. One strategy to support this is to tap into the flow of production data and siphon off a small\n\npercentage that is then changed in randomized fashion ‚Äî obfuscating the real data but keeping the same\n\ngeneral shape and range of values.\n\nThe **DEV** environment should be accessible to everyone without any organizational red tape. The DEV\n\nenvironments should be small and controlled with policies that spin them up and tear them down efficiently.\n\nEvery aspect of the DEV infrastructure should be treated as ephemeral. Nothing should exist in the\n\nenvironment that cannot be destroyed and easily rebuilt.\n\nThe **TEST** environment should mimic the PROD environment as much as possible, including the monitoring\n\ntools ‚Äî within obvious cost/budget constraints. The use of the TEST environment can be requested by\n\nthe developers, but the process is governed using a workflow/sign-off approval approach ‚Äî signed off by\n\nmanagement.\n\nMoving to **PROD** is the final step, and there usually is a ‚Äúseparation of duties‚Äù that is required so that\n\ndevelopers cannot randomly promote software to run in production. Again, this process should be\n\nstrictly governed using a workflow/sign-off approval approach ‚Äî signed off by management as well.\n\nMany organizations fully automate the steps, except the sign-offs, and support the notion of continuous\n\ndeployments.\n\n\n**DEV** **TEST**\n\n**PROD**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 8. Make informed build vs. buy decisions\n\nA key piece of the strategy will involve the decision around which components of the data ecosystem are\n\nbuilt by the in-house engineering team and which components are purchased through a vendor relationship.\n\nThere is increased emphasis within engineering teams on taking a ‚Äúbuilder‚Äù approach. In other words, the\n\nengineering teams prefer to develop their own solutions in-house rather than rely on vendor products.\n\n**Competitive advantage**\n\nThis ‚Äúroll your own‚Äô‚Äô approach has some advantages ‚Äî including being able to establish the overall product\n\nvision, prioritize features and directly allocate the resources to build the software. However, it is important to\n\nkeep in mind which aspects of your development effort give you the most competitive advantage.\n\nSpend some time working with the data transformation steering committee and other stakeholders to\n\ndebate the pros and cons of building out various pieces of the data ecosystem. The primary factor should\n\ncome down to whether or not a given solution offers true competitive advantage for the organization. Does\n\nbuilding this piece of software make it harder for your competitors to compete with you? If the answer is no,\n\nthen it is better to focus your engineering and data science resources on deriving insights from your data.\n\n**Beware: becoming your own software vendor**\n\nAs many engineering leaders know, building your own software is an exciting challenge. However, it does\n\ncome with added responsibility ‚Äî namely, managing the overall project timeline and costs, and being\n\nresponsible for the design, implementation, testing, documentation, training, and ongoing maintenance and\n\nupdates. You basically are becoming your own software vendor for every component of the ecosystem\n\nthat you build yourself. When you consider the cost of a standard-sized team, it is not uncommon to spend\n\nseveral million dollars per year building out individual component parts of the new data system. This doesn‚Äôt\n\ninclude the cost to operate and maintain the software once it is in production.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo offset the anticipated development costs, engineering teams will oftentimes make the argument that\n\nthey are starting with open source software and extending it to meet the ‚Äúunique requirements‚Äù of your\n\norganization. It‚Äôs worth pressure testing this approach and making sure that a) the requirements truly are\n\nunique and b) the development offers the competitive advantage that you need.\n\nEven software built on top of open source still requires significant investment in integration and testing.\n\nThe integration work is particularly challenging because of the large number of open source libraries that\n\nare required in the data science space. The question becomes, ‚ÄúIs this really the area that you want your\n\nengineering teams focused on?‚Äù Or would it be better to ‚Äúoutsource‚Äú this component to a third party?\n\n**How long will it take? Can the organization afford to wait?**\n\nEven if you decide the software component provides a competitive advantage and is something worth\n\nbuilding in-house, the next question that you should ask is, ‚ÄúHow long will it take?‚Äù There is definitely a\n\ntime-to-market consideration, and the build vs. buy decision needs to also account for the impact to the\n\nbusiness due to the anticipated delivery schedule. Keep in mind that software development projects usually\n\ntake longer and cost more money than initially planned.\n\nThe organization should understand the impact to the overall performance and capabilities of the daily\n\necosystem for any features tied to the in-house development effort. Your business partners likely do\n\nnot care how the data ecosystem is implemented as long as it works, meets their needs, is performant,\n\nis reliable and is delivered on time. Carefully weigh the trade-offs among competitive advantage, cost,\n\nfeatures and schedule.\n\n\nDatabricks is built on top of popular open source\n\nsoftware that it created. Engineering teams can\n\nimprove the underpinnings of the Databricks\n\nplatform by submitting code via pull request and\n\nbecoming committers to the projects. The benefit\n\nto organizations is that their engineers contribute\n\nto the feature set of the data platform while\n\nDatabricks remains responsible for all integration\n\nand performance testing plus all the runtime\n\nsupport, including failover and disaster recovery.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Don‚Äôt forget about the data**\n\nPerhaps the single most important feature of a modern data stack is its ability to help make data sets and\n\n‚Äúdata assets‚Äù consumable to the end users or systems. Data insights, model training and model execution\n\ncannot happen in a reliable manner unless the data they depend on can be trusted and is of good quality.\n\nIn large organizations, revenue opportunities and the ability to reduce risk often depend on merging data\n\nsets from multiple lines of business or departments. Focusing your data engineering and data science\n\nefforts on curating data and creating robust and reliable pipelines likely provides the best chance at\n\ncreating true competitive advantage.\n\nThe amount of work required to properly catalog, schema enforce, quality check, partition, secure and\n\nserve up data for analysis should not be underestimated. The value of this work is equally important to\n\nthe business. The ability to curate data to enable game-changing insights should be the focus of the work\n\nled by the CDO and CIO. This has much more to do with the data than it does with the ability to have your\n\nengineers innovate on components that don‚Äôt bring true competitive advantage.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 9. Allocate, monitor and optimize costs\n\nBeginning in 1987, Southwest Airlines famously standardized on flying a single airplane type ‚Äî the Boeing 737\n\nclass of aircraft. This decision allowed the airline to save on both operations and maintenance ‚Äî requiring\n\nonly one type of simulator to train pilots, streamlining their spare parts supply chain and maintaining a\n\nmore manageable parts inventory. Their pilots and maintenance crews were effectively interchangeable in\n\ncase anyone ever called in sick or missed a connection. The key takeaway is that in order to reduce costs\n\nand increase efficiency, Southwest created their own version of a unified platform ‚Äî getting all their flight-\n\nrelated personas to collaborate and operate from the same point of view. Lessons learned on the platform\n\ncould be easily shared and reused by other members of the team. The more the team used the unified\n\nplatform, the more they collaborated and their level of expertise increased.\n\n**Reduce complexity, reduce costs**\n\nThe architectures of enterprise data warehouses (EDWs) and data lakes were either more limited or\n\nmore complex ‚Äî resulting in increased time to market and increased costs. This was mainly due to the\n\nrequirement to perform ETL to explore data in the EDW or the need to split data using multiple pipelines\n\nfor the data lake. The data lakehouse architecture simplifies the cost allocation because all the processing,\n\nserving and analytics are performed in a single compute layer.\n\nOrganizations can rightsize the data environments and control costs using policies. The centralized\n\nand consistent approach to security, auditing and monitoring makes it easier to spot inefficiencies and\n\nbottlenecks in the data ecosystem. Performance improvements can be gained quickly as more platform\n\nexpertise is developed within the workforce.\n\n\nThe Databricks platform optimizes costs for your\n\ndata and AI workloads by intelligently provisioning\n\ninfrastructure only as you need it. Customers can\n\nestablish policies that govern the size of clusters\n\nbased on DEV, TEST, PROD environments or\n\nanticipated workloads.\n\n\n-----\n\nDatabricks monitors and records usage and allows\n\norganizations to easily track costs on a data and\n\n\n**Centralized funding model**\n\nAs previously mentioned, data transformation initiatives require substantial funding. Centralizing the budget\n\nunder the CDO provides consistency and visibility into how funds are allocated and spent ‚Äî increasing\n\nthe likelihood of a positive ROI. Funding at the beginning of the initiative will be significantly higher than\n\nthe funding in the out-years. It‚Äôs not uncommon to see 3- to 5-year project plans for larger organizations.\n\nFunding for years 1 and 2 is often reduced in years 3 and 4 and further reduced in year 5 ‚Äî until it reaches a\n\nsteady state that is more sustainable.\n\n\nAI workload basis. This provides the ability to\n\n\nThe budget takes into account the cost of the data engineering function, commercial software licenses and\n\nbuilding out the center of excellence to accelerate the data science capabilities of the organization. Again,\n\nthe CDO must partner closely with the CIO and the enterprise architect to make sure that the resources are\n\nfocused on the overall implementation plan and to make sound build vs. buy decisions.\n\nIt‚Äôs common to see the full budget controlled by the CDO, with a significant portion allocated to resources\n\nin the CIO‚Äôs organization to perform the data engineering tasks. The data science community reports into\n\nthe CDO and is matrixed into the lines of business in order to better understand the business drivers and\n\nthe data sets. Finally, investing in data governance cannot wait until the company has suffered from a major\n\nregulatory challenge, a data breach or some other serious defense-related problem. CDOs should spend\n\nthe necessary time to educate leaders throughout the organization on the value of data governance.\n\n\nimplement an enterprise-wide chargeback mode\n\nand put in place appropriate spending limits.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Chargeback models**\n\nTo establish the centralized budget to fund the data transformation initiative, some organizations impose\n\na ‚Äútax‚Äù on each part of the organization ‚Äî based on size as well as profit and loss. This base-level funding\n\nshould be used to build the data engineering and data science teams needed to deploy the building blocks\n\nof the new data ecosystem. However, as different teams, departments and business units begin using the\n\nnew data ecosystem, the infrastructure costs, both compute and storage, will begin to grow. The costs will\n\nnot be evenly distributed, due to different levels of usage from the various parts of the organization. The\n\ngroups with the heavier usage should obviously cover their pro rata share of the costs. This requires the\n\nability to monitor and track usage ‚Äî not only based on compute but also on the amount of data generated\n\nand consumed. This so-called chargeback model is an effective and fair way to cover the cost deltas over\n\nand above the base-level funding.\n\nPlus, not all the departments or lines of business will require the same level of compute power or fault\n\ntolerance. The architecture should support the ability to separate out the runtime portions of the data\n\necosystem and isolate the workloads based on the specific SLAs for the use cases in each environment.\n\nSome workloads cannot fail and their SLAs will require full redundancy, thus increasing the number of\n\nnodes in the cluster or even requiring multiple clusters operating in different cloud regions. In contrast, less\n\ncritical workloads that can fail and be restarted can run on less costly infrastructure. This makes it easier to\n\nbetter manage the ecosystem by avoiding a one-size-fits-all approach and allocating costs to where the\n\nperformance is needed most.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### 10. Move to production and scale adoption\n\nNow that you‚Äôve completed the hard work outlined in the first nine steps, it is time to put the new data\n\necosystem to use. In order to get truly game-changing results, organizations must be really disciplined at\n\nmanaging and using data to enable use cases that drive business value. They must also establish a clear\n\nset of metrics to measure adoption and track the net promoter score (NPS) so that the user experience\n\ncontinues to improve over time.\n\n**If you build it, they will come**\n\nKeep in mind that your business partners are likely the ones to do the heavy lifting when it comes to data\n\nset registration. Without a robust set of relevant, quality data to use, the data ecosystem will be useless.\n\nA high level of automation for the registration process is important because it‚Äôs not uncommon to see\n\nthousands of data sets in large organizations. The business and technical metadata plus the data quality\n\nrules will help guarantee that the data lake is filled with consumable data. The lineage solution should\n\nprovide a visualization that shows the data movement and verifies that the approved data flow paths are\n\nbeing followed.\n\nSome key metrics to keep an eye on are:\n\n\u0007Percentage of source systems contributing data to the ecosystem\n\n\u0007Percentage of real-time streaming relative to API and batch transfers\n\n\u0007Percentage of registered data sets with full business and technical metadata\n\n\u0007Volume of data written to the data lake\n\n\u0007Percentage of raw data that enters a data curation pipeline\n\n\u0007Volume of data consumed from the data lake\n\n\u0007Number of tables defined and populated with curated data\n\n\u0007Number of models trained with data from the data lake\n\n\u0007Lineage reports and anomaly detection incidents\n\n\u0007Number of users running Python, SQL, Scala and R workloads\n\n\nIn 2018, Databricks released MLflow ‚Äî an open\n\nsource platform to manage the ML lifecycle,\n\nincluding experimentation, reproducibility,\n\ndeployment and a central model registry. MLflow\n\nis included in the Databricks Lakehouse Platform\n\nand accelerates the adoption of machine learning\n\nand AI in organizations.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Communication plan**\n\nCommunication is critical throughout the data transformation initiative ‚Äî however, it is particularly\n\nimportant once you move into production. Time is precious and you want to avoid rework, if at all possible.\n\nOrganizations often overlook the emotional and cultural toll that a long transformation process takes on\n\nthe workforce. The seam between the legacy environment and the new data ecosystem is an expensive\n\nand exhausting place to be ‚Äî because your business partners are busy supporting two data worlds. Most\n\nusers just want to know when the new environment will be ready. They don‚Äôt want to work with partially\n\ncompleted features, especially while performing double duty.\n\nEstablish a solid communication plan and set expectations for when features will come online. Make sure\n\nthere is detailed documentation, training and a support/help desk to field users‚Äô questions.\n\n**DevOps ‚Äî software development + IT operations**\n\nMature organizations develop a series of processes and standards for how software and data are developed,\n\nmanaged and delivered. The term ‚ÄúDevOps‚Äù comes from the software engineering world and refers to\n\ndeveloping and operating large-scale software systems. DevOps defines how an organization, its developers,\n\noperations staff and other stakeholders establish the goal of delivering quality software reliably and\n\nrepeatedly. In short, DevOps is a culture that consists of two practices: continuous integration (CI) and\n\ncontinuous delivery (CD).\n\nThe CI portion of the process is the practice of frequently integrating newly written or changed code\n\nwith the existing code repository. As software is written, it is continuously saved back to the source code\n\nrepository, merged with other changes, built, integrated and tested ‚Äî and this should occur frequently\n\nenough that the window between commit and build is narrow enough that no errors can occur without\n\ndevelopers noticing them and correcting them immediately.\n\nThis is particularly important for large, distributed teams to ensure that the software is always in a working\n\nstate ‚Äî despite the frequent changes from various developers. Only software that passes the CI steps is\n\ndeployed ‚Äî resulting in shortened development cycles, increased deployment velocity and the creation of\n\ndependable releases.\n\n\nSoftware development IT operations\n\n\n-----\n\n**DataOps ‚Äî data processing + IT operations**\n\nDataOps is a relatively new focus area for the data engineering and data science communities. Its goal is to\n\nuse the well-established processes from DevOps to consistently and reliably improve the quality of data\n\nused to power data and AI use cases. DataOps automates and streamlines the lifecycle management tasks\n\nneeded for large volumes of data ‚Äî basically, ensuring that the volume, velocity, variety and veracity of the\n\ndata are taken into account as data flows through the environment. DataOps aims to reduce the end-to-\n\nend cycle time of data analytics ‚Äî from idea, to exploration, to visualizations and to the creation of new\n\ndata sets, data assets and models that create value.\n\nFor DataOps to be effective, it must encourage collaboration, innovation and reuse among the stakeholders,\n\nand the data tooling should be designed to support the workflow and make all aspects of data curation and\n\nETL more efficient.\n\n**MLOps ‚Äî machine learning + IT operations**\n\nNot surprisingly, the term ‚ÄúMLOps‚Äù takes the DevOps approach and applies it to the machine learning and\n\ndeep learning space ‚Äî automating or streamlining the core workflow for data scientists. MLOps is a bit\n\nunique when compared with DevOps and DataOps because the approach to deploying effective machine\n\nlearning models is far more iterative and requires much more experimentation ‚Äî data scientists try different\n\nfeatures, parameters and models in a tight iteration cycle. In all these iterations, they must manage the code\n\nbase, understand the data used to perform the training and create reproducible results. The logging aspect\n\nof the ML development lifecycle is critical.\n\nMLOps aims to manage deployment of machine learning and deep learning models in large-scale\n\nproduction environments while also focusing on business and regulatory requirements. The ideal MLOps\n\nenvironment would include data science tools where models are constructed and analytical engines where\n\ncomputations are performed.\n\n\nData processing IT operations\n\n#### ÔÅß\n\nMachine learning IT operations\n\n\n-----\n\nThe overall workflow for deploying production ML models is shown in Figure 10.\n\nUnlike most software applications that execute a series of discrete operations, ML platforms are not\n\ndeterministic and are highly dependent on the statistical profile of the data they use. ML platforms can\n\nsuffer performance degradation of the system due to changing data profiles. Therefore, the model has to\n\nbe refreshed even if it currently ‚Äúworks‚Äù ‚Äî leading to more iterations of the ML workflow. The ML platform\n\nshould natively support this style of iterative data science.\n\n**Ethics in AI**\n\nAs more organizations deploy data and AI solutions, there is growing concern around a number of issues\n\nrelated to ethics ‚Äî in particular, how do you ensure the data and algorithms used to make decisions are\n\nfair and ethical, and that the outcomes have the appropriate impact on the target audience? Organizations\n\nmust ensure that the ‚Äúblack box‚Äù algorithms that produce results have the transparency, interpretability and\n\nexplainability to satisfy legal and regulatory safeguards.\n\nThe vast majority of AI work still involves software development by human beings and the use of curated\n\ndata sets. There is the obvious potential for bias and the application of AI in domains that are ethically\n\nquestionable. CDOs are faced with the added challenge of needing to be able to defend the use of AI,\n\nexplain how it works and describe the impact of its existence on the target audience ‚Äî whether internal\n\nworkers or customers.\n\n\nData extraction\n\nData preparation\n\nModel eÔøΩaluation\n\n\nData analIÔøΩiÔøΩ\n\n4\nModel training\n\n6\nModel ÔøΩerÔøΩing and\nexecution\n\n\nModel monitoring\n\n**Figure 10:**\nWorkflow for deploying production ML models\n\n\n-----\n\n**Data and AI Maturity Model**\n\nWhen data and AI become part of the fabric of the company and the stakeholders in the organization adopt\n\na data asset and AI mindset, the company moves further along a well-defined maturity curve, as shown in\n\nFigure 11.\n\n**Top-Line Categories and Ranking Criteria**\n\n**L O W M AT U R I T Y / V A L U E** **H I G H M AT U R I T Y / V A L U E**\n\n1.

Everyday, more and more\n\norganizations must exchange data with their customers, suppliers\n\nand partners. Security is critical. And yet, efficiency and immediate\n\naccessibility are equally important.\n\nWhere data sharing may have been considered optional, it‚Äôs now\n\nrequired. More organizations are investing in streamlining internal\n\nand external data sharing across the value chain. But they still face\n\nmajor roadblocks ‚Äî from human inhibition to legacy solutions to\n\nvendor lock-in.\n\nTo be truly data-driven, organizations need a better way to share\n\ndata. [Gartner predicts that by 2024](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3999501) , organizations that promote\n\ndata sharing will outperform their peers on most business value\n\n\nwho have successfully executed data sharing initiatives are 1.7x\n\nmore effective in showing business value and return on investment\n\nfrom their data analytics strategy.\n\nTo compete in the digital economy, organizations need an open ‚Äî\n\nand secure ‚Äî approach to data sharing.\n\nThis eBook takes a deep dive into the modern era of data sharing\n\nand collaboration, from common use cases and key benefits to\n\nconventional approaches and the challenges of those methods.\n\nYou‚Äôll get an overview of our open approach to data sharing and find\n\nout how Databricks allows you to share your data across platforms,\n\nto share all your data and AI, and to share all your data securely with\n\nunified governance in a privacy-safe way.\n\n\nmetrics. In addition, Gartner recently found that Chief Data Officers\n\n\n-----\n\n## Chapter 1\n What Is Data Sharing and Why Is It Important?\n\nData sharing is the ability to make the same data available to one or many stakeholders ‚Äî both external\n\nand internal. Nowadays, the ever-growing amount of data has become a strategic asset for any company.\n\nData sharing ‚Äî within your organization or externally ‚Äî is an enabling technology for data commercialization\n\nand enhanced analysis. Sharing data as well as consuming data from external sources allows companies\n\nto collaborate with partners, establish new partnerships and generate new revenue streams with data\n\nmonetization. Data sharing can deliver benefits to business groups across the enterprise. For those business\n\ngroups, data sharing can enable access to data needed to make critical decisions. This includes but is not\n\nlimited to roles such as the data analyst, data scientist and data engineer.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Common data sharing use cases\n\n\n#### Data\n monetization\n\nCompanies across industries are commercializing\n\ndata. Large multinational organizations have\n\nformed exclusively to monetize data, while other\n\norganizations are looking for ways to monetize\n\ntheir data and generate additional revenue\n\nstreams. Examples of these companies can\n\nrange from an agency with an identity graph to a\n\ntelecommunication company with proprietary 5G\n\ndata or to retailers that have a unique ability to\n\ncombine online and offline data. Data vendors are\n\ngrowing in importance as companies realize they\n\nneed external data for better decision-making.\n\n\n#### Data sharing with partners\n or suppliers (B2B)\n\nMany companies now strive to share data with\n\npartners and suppliers as similarly as they share\n\nit across their own organizations. For example,\n\nretailers and their suppliers continue to work more\n\nclosely together as they seek to keep their products\n\nmoving in an era of ever-changing consumer tastes.\n\nRetailers can keep suppliers posted by sharing sales\n\ndata by SKU in real time, while suppliers can share\n\nreal-time inventory data with retailers so they know\n\nwhat to expect. Scientific research organizations\n\ncan make their data available to pharmaceutical\n\ncompanies engaged in drug discovery. Public safety\n\nagencies can provide real-time public data feeds\n\nof environmental data, such as climate change\n\nstatistics or updates on potential volcanic eruptions.\n\n\n#### Internal lines of business\n (LOBs) sharing\n\nWithin any company, different departments, lines\n\nof business and subsidiaries seek to share data so\n\neveryone can make decisions based on a complete\n\nview of the current business reality. For example,\n\nfinance and HR departments need to share data\n\nas they analyze the true costs of each employee.\n\nMarketing and sales teams need a common view\n\nof data to determine the effectiveness of recent\n\nmarketing campaigns. And different subsidiaries\n\nof the same company need a unified view of the\n\nhealth of the business. Removing data silos ‚Äî which\n\nare often established for the important purpose of\n\npreventing unauthorized access to data ‚Äî is critical\n\nfor digital transformation initiatives and maximizing\n\nthe business value of data.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Key benefits of data sharing\n\nAs you can see from the use cases described above, there are many benefits of data sharing, including:\n\n\n**Greater collaboration with existing partners.** In today‚Äôs hyper-\n\nconnected digital economy, no single organization can advance its\n\nbusiness objectives without partnerships. Data sharing helps solidify\n\nexisting partnerships and can help organizations establish new ones.\n\n\u0007 **Ability to generate new revenue streams.** With data sharing,\n\norganizations can generate new revenue streams by offering data\n\nproducts or data services to their end consumers.\n\n\n**Ease of producing new products, services or business models.**\n\nProduct teams can leverage both first-party data and third-party\n\ndata to refine their products and services and expand their product/\n\nservice catalog.\n\n**Greater efficiency of internal operations.** Teams across the\n\norganization can meet their business goals far more quickly when\n\nthey don‚Äôt have to spend time figuring out how to free data from\n\nsilos. When teams have access to live data, there‚Äôs no lag time\n\nbetween the need for data and the connection with the appropriate\n\ndata source.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Chapter 2\n Conventional Methods of Data Sharing and Their Challenges\n\nSharing data across different platforms, companies and clouds is no easy task. In the past,\n\norganizations have hesitated to share data more freely because of the perceived lack\n\nof secure technology, competitive concerns and the cost of implementing data sharing\n\nsolutions.\n\nEven for companies that have the budget to implement data sharing technology, many of\n\nthe current approaches can‚Äôt keep up with today‚Äôs requirements for open-format, multi-\n\ncloud, high-performance solutions. Most data sharing solutions are tied to a single vendor,\n\nwhich creates friction for data providers and data consumers who use non-compatible\n\nplatforms.\n\nOver the past 30 years, data sharing solutions have come in three forms: legacy and\n\nhomegrown solutions, cloud object storage and closed source commercial solutions.\n\nEach of these approaches comes with its pros and cons.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Legacy and homegrown solutions\n\nMany companies have built homegrown data sharing solutions based on legacy\n\ntechnologies such as email, (S)FTP or APIs.\n\n\nProvider\n\nETL\n\n\nConsumer\n\n\nBatch data\nfrom provider\n\n\nTable ÔøΩ\n\nTable 2\n\n\nFTP/SSH/API\nServer\n\n\nFTP/SSH/API ETL Database Analyst Run Analysis\nServer\n\n\n**Figure 1:**\nLegacy data\nsharing solutions\n\n\n**Pros**\n\n\u0007 **Vendor agnostic.** FTP, email and APIs are all well-documented protocols. Data\n\nconsumers can leverage a suite of clients to access data provided to them.\n\n\u0007 **Flexibility.** Many homegrown solutions are built on open source technologies\n\nand will work both on-prem and on clouds.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Cons**\n\n\u0007 **Data movement.** It takes significant effort to extract data from cloud storage, transform\n\nit and host it on an FTP server for different recipients. Additionally, this approach\n\nresults in creating copies of data sets. Data copying causes duplication and prevents\n\norganizations from instantly accessing live data.\n\n\u0007 **Complexity of sharing data.** Homegrown solutions are typically built on complex\n\narchitectures due to replication and provisioning. This can add considerable time to\n\ndata sharing activities and result in out-of-date data for end consumers.\n\n\u0007 **Operational overhead for data recipients.** Data recipients have to extract, transform\n\nand load (ETL) the shared data for their end use cases, which further delays the time to\n\ninsights. For any new data updates from the providers, the consumers have to rerun ETL\n\npipelines again and again.\n\n\u0007 **Security and governance.** As modern data requirements become more stringent,\n\nhomegrown and legacy technologies have become more difficult to secure and govern.\n\n\u0007 **Scalability.** Such solutions are costly to manage and maintain and don‚Äôt scale to\n\naccommodate large data sets.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Proprietary vendor solutions\n\nCommercial data sharing solutions are a popular option among companies that don‚Äôt want\n\nto devote the time and resources to building an in-house solution yet also want more\n\ncontrol than what cloud object storage can offer.\n\n\nVendor 1 Platform\n\nProprietary\ndata format\n\n\nVendor V Platform\n\nProprietary\ndata format\n\n\nData Provider 1\n\nData;\nProvider\n\n\nData Provider 1\n\n\nData;\nConsumer\n\nShared data set\n\n\nData;\nProvider\n\nShared dataset\n\n\nData;\nConsumer\n\n\nNo cross-platform\nsharing\n\n\n**Figure 2:**\nProprietary\nvendor solutions\n\n\nShared dataset\n\nShared data set\n\n\nShared data set\n\n\nShared data set\n\n\nSharing limited to recipients\non the same platform\n\nData;\nConsumer\n\n\nData;\nConsumere\n\n\n**Pros**\n\n\u0007 **Simplicity.** Commercial solutions allow users to share data easily with anyone else who uses\n\nthe same platform.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Cons**\n\n\u0007 **Vendor lock-in.** Commercial solutions don‚Äôt interop with other platforms well. While\n\ndata sharing is easy among fellow customers, it‚Äôs usually impossible with those who\n\nuse competing solutions. This reduces the reach of data, resulting in vendor lock-in.\n\nFurthermore, platform differences between data providers and recipients introduce\n\ndata sharing complexities.\n\n\u0007 **Data movement.** Data must be loaded onto the platform, requiring additional ETL and\n\ndata copies.\n\n\u0007 **Scalability.** Commercial data sharing comes with scaling limits from the vendors.\n\n\u0007 **Cost.** All the above challenges create additional cost for sharing data with potential\n\nconsumers, as data providers have to replicate data for different recipients on different\n\ncloud platforms.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Cloud object storage\n\n\n**Cons**\n\n\u0007 **Limited to a single cloud provider.** Recipients have to be on the\n\nsame cloud to access the objects.\n\n\u0007 **Cumbersome security and governance.** Assigning permissions\n\nand managing access is complex. Custom application logic is\n\nneeded to generate signed URLs.\n\n\u0007 **Complexity.** Personas managing data sharing (DBAs, analysts)\n\nfind it difficult to understand Identity Access Management\n\n(IAM) policies and how data is mapped to underlying files. For\n\ncompanies with large volumes of data, sharing via cloud storage\n\nis time-consuming, cumbersome and nearly impossible to scale.\n\n\u0007 **Operational overhead for data recipients.** The data recipients\n\nhave to run extract, transform and load (ETL) pipelines on the\n\nraw files before consuming them for their end use cases.\n\nThe lack of a comprehensive solution makes it challenging for data\n\nproviders and consumers to easily share data. Cumbersome and\n\nincomplete data sharing processes also constrain the development\n\nof business opportunities from shared data.\n\n\nObject storage is considered a good fit for the cloud because it is\n\nelastic and can more easily scale into multiple petabytes to support\n\nunlimited data growth. The big three cloud providers all offer object\n\nstorage services (AWS S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage) that\n\nare cheap, scalable and extremely reliable.\n\nAn interesting feature of cloud object storage is the ability to\n\ngenerate signed URLs, which grant time-limited permission to\n\ndownload objects. Anyone who receives the presigned URL can\n\nthen access the specified objects, making this a convenient\n\nway to share data.\n\n**Pros**\n\n\u0007 **Sharing data in place.** Object storage can be shared in place,\n\nallowing consumers to access the latest available data.\n\n\u0007 **Scalability.** Cloud object storage profits from availability and\n\ndurability guarantees that typically cannot be achieved\n\non-premises. Data consumers retrieve data directly from the\n\ncloud providers, saving bandwidth for the providers.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Chapter 3\n Delta Sharing ‚Äî An Open Standard for Secure Sharing of Data Assets\n\n\nWe believe the future of data sharing should be characterized by\n\nopen technology. Data sharing shouldn‚Äôt be tied to a proprietary\n\ntechnology that introduces unnecessary limitations and financial\n\nburdens to the process. It should be readily available to anyone who\n\nwants to share data at scale. This philosophy inspired us to develop\n\nand release a new protocol for sharing data: Delta Sharing.\n\n#### What is Delta Sharing?\n\nDelta Sharing provides an open solution to securely share live data\n\nfrom your lakehouse to any computing platform. Recipients don‚Äôt\n\n\nData providers can centrally manage, govern, audit and track\n\nusage of the shared data on one platform. Delta Sharing is natively\n\nintegrated with [Unity Catalog](https://databricks.com/product/unity-catalog) , enabling organizations to centrally\n\nmanage and audit shared data across organizations and confidently\n\nshare data assets while meeting security and compliance needs.\n\nWith Delta Sharing, organizations can easily share existing large-\n\nscale data sets based on the open source formats Apache Parquet\n\nand Delta Lake without moving data. Teams gain the flexibility to\n\nquery, visualize, transform, ingest or enrich shared data with their\n\ntools of choice.\n\n\nhave to be on the Databricks platform or on the same cloud or a\n\ncloud at all. Data providers can share live data without replicating\n\nit or moving it to another system. Recipients benefit from always\n\nhaving access to the latest version of data and can quickly query\n\nshared data using tools of their choice for BI, analytics and machine\n\nlearning, reducing time-to-value.\n\n\n-----\n\nData ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩiÔøΩeÔøΩ\n\n\nAny uÔøΩe cyÔøΩe\n\nAnalytics\n\nBI\n\nData Science\n\n\nData Recipient\n\nAny sool\n\nAnd many more\n\n\nAny cloud/on-prem\n\nOn-premises\n\n\nAccess permissions\n\nDelta Sharing Protocol\n\n\nDelta ÔøΩaÔøΩe ÔøΩaÔøΩle Delta Sharing SerÔøΩer\n\n\nNo replication\nEasy to manage\nSecure\n\n\n**Figure 3:**\nDelta Sharing\n\n\nDatabricks designed Delta Sharing with five goals in mind:\n\n\u0007Provide an open cross-platform sharing solution\n\n\u0007Share live data without copying it to another system\n\n\u0007Support a wide range of clients such as Power BI, Tableau, Apache Spark‚Ñ¢, pandas and Java, and\n\nprovide flexibility to consume data using the tools of choice for BI, machine learning and AI use cases\n\n\u0007Provide strong security, auditing and governance\n\n\u0007Scale to massive structured data sets and also allow sharing of unstructured data and future data\n\nderivatives such as ML models, dashboards and notebooks, in addition to tabular data\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Key benefits of Delta Sharing\n\nBy eliminating the obstacles and shortcomings associated with typical data sharing\n\napproaches, Delta Sharing delivers several key benefits, including:\n\n\n**Open cross-platform sharing.** Delta Sharing establishes a new\n\nopen standard for secure data sharing and supports open source\n\nDelta and Apache Parquet formats. Data recipients don‚Äôt have to be\n\non the Databricks platform or on the same cloud, as Delta Sharing\n\nworks across clouds and even from cloud to on-premises setups. To\n\ngive customers even greater flexibility, Databricks has also released\n\nopen source connectors for pandas, Apache Spark, Elixir and\n\nPython, and is working with partners on many more.\n\n\u0007 **Securely share live data without replication.** Most enterprise\n\n\n**Centralized governance.** With Databricks Delta Sharing, data\n\nproviders can grant, track, audit and even revoke access to shared\n\ndata sets from a single point of enforcement to meet compliance and\n\nother regulatory requirements. Databricks Delta Sharing users get:\n\n\u0007Implementation of Delta Sharing as part of Unity Catalog, the\n\ngovernance offering for Databricks Lakehouse\n\n\u0007Simple, more secure setup and management of shares\n\n\u0007The ability to create and manage recipients and data shares\n\n\u0007Audit logging captured automatically as part of Unity Catalog\n\n\u0007Direct integration with the rest of the Databricks ecosystem\n\n\u0007No separate compute for providing and managing shares\n\n\ndata today is stored in cloud data lakes. Any of these existing data\n\nsets on the provider‚Äôs data lake can easily be shared without any\n\ndata replication or physical movement of data. Data providers can\n\nupdate their data sets reliably in real time and provide a fresh and\n\nconsistent view of their data to recipients.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Share data products, including AI models, dashboards and**\n\n**notebooks, with greater flexibility.** Data providers can choose\n\nbetween sharing anentire table or sharing only a version or\n\nspecific partitions of a table. However, sharing just tabular data\n\nis not enough to meet today‚Äôs consumer demands. Delta Sharing\n\nalso supports sharing of non-tabular data and data derivatives\n\nsuch as data streams, AI models, SQL views and arbitrary files,\n\nenablingincreased collaboration and innovation. Data providers can\n\nbuild, package and distribute data products including data sets,\n\nAI and notebooks, allowingdata recipients to get insights faster.\n\nFurthermore, this approach promotes and empowers the exchange\n\nof knowledge ‚Äî not just data ‚Äî between different organizations.\n\n\n**Share data at a lower cost.** Delta Sharing lowers the cost of\n\nmanaging and consuming shares for both data providers and\n\nrecipients. Providers can share data from their cloud object store\n\nwithout replicating, thereby reducing the cost of storage. Incontrast,\n\nexisting data sharing platforms require data providers to first move\n\ntheir data into their platform or store data in proprietary formats in\n\ntheir managed storage, which often costs more and results in data\n\nduplication. With Delta Sharing, data providers don‚Äôt need to set\n\nup separate computing environments to share data. Consumers\n\ncan access shared data directly using their tools of choice without\n\nsetting up specific consumption ecosystems, thereby reducing\n\ncosts.\n\n\nWith Delta Sharing we are able to achieve a truly open marketplace\n\nand truly open ecosystem. In contrast, commercial products are\n\nmostly limited to sharing raw tabular data and cannot be used to\n\n\nshare these higher-valued data derivatives.\n\n\n\u0007 **Reduced time-to-value.** Delta Sharing eliminates the need to\n\nset up a new ingestion process to consume data. Data recipients\n\ncan directly access the fresh data and query it using tools of their\n\nchoice. Recipients can also enrich data with data sets from popular\n\ndata providers. The Delta Sharing ecosystem of open source and\n\ncommercial partners is growing every day.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Maximizing value of data with Delta Sharing\n\nDelta Sharing is already transforming data sharing activities for companies in a wide range of industries. Given the sheer\n\nvariety of data available and the technologies that are emerging, it is hard to anticipate all the possible use cases Delta\n\nSharing can address. The Delta Sharing approach is to share any data anytime with anyone easily and securely.\n\nIn this section we will explore the building blocks of such an approach and the use cases emerging from these.\n\n\n‚ÄúDelta Sharing helped us streamline our data delivery process\n\nfor large data sets. This enables our clients to bring their own\n\ncompute environment to read fresh curated data with little-to-\n\nno integration work, and enables us to continue expanding our\n\ncatalog of unique, high-quality data products.‚Äù\n\n‚Äî **William Dague** , Head of Alternative Data, Nasdaq\n\n\n‚ÄúWe recognize that openness of data will play a key role in\n\nachieving Shell‚Äôs Carbon Net Zero ambitions. Delta Sharing\n\nprovides Shell with a standard, controlled and secure protocol\n\nfor sharing vast amounts of data easily with our partners to work\n\ntoward these goals without requiring our partners be on the same\n\ndata sharing platform.‚Äù\n\n‚Äî **Bryce Bartmann** , Chief Digital Technology Advisor, Shell\n\n\n‚ÄúLeveraging the powerful capabilities of Delta Sharing from\n\n\nDatabricks enables Pumpjack Dataworks to have a faster\n\nonboarding experience, removing the need for exporting,\n\nimporting and remodeling of data, which brings immediate\n\nvalue to our clients. Faster results yield greater commercial\n\nopportunity for our clients and their partners.‚Äù\n\n\n‚ÄúData accessibility is a massive consideration for us. We believe\n\nthat Delta Sharing will simplify data pipelines by enabling us to\n\nquery fresh data from the place where it lives, and we are not\n\nlocked into any platform or data format.‚Äù\n\n‚Äî **Rayne Gaisford** , Global Head of Data Strategy, Jefferies\n\n\n‚Äî **Corey Zwart** , Head of Engineering, Pumpjack Dataworks\n\n‚ÄúAs a data company, giving our customers access to our data sets\n\nis critical. The Databricks Lakehouse Platform with Delta Sharing\n\nreally streamlines that process, allowing us to securely reach a\n\nmuch broader user base regardless of cloud or platform.‚Äù\n\n‚Äî **Felix Cheung** , VP of Engineering, SafeGraph\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Data monetization with Delta Sharing\n\nDelta Sharing enables companies to monetize their data product simply and with necessary governance.\n\nData /on.2-er $\n\n\nCloud Storage\n\n\nFulfllleen\n\nEntitles various data products\n\nData Vendor\n\nUnity\nCatalog\n\n\nUnity\nCatalog\n\nCloud Storage\n\nData /on.2-er ÔøΩ\n\nN o n - D ata b r i c k s C u s t o m e r\n\nO n a n y c lo u d o r o n - p r e m i s e s\n\nStorage\n\n\nR/O\n\nR/O\n\n\n**Figure 4:**\nData monetization\nwith Delta Sharing\n\n\nDelta\nSharing\n\n\nBillieg Audit Log\n\n\n-----\n\nWith Delta Sharing, a data provider can seamlessly share large data sets and overcome\n\nthe scalability issues associated with SFTP servers. Data providers can easily expand their\n\ndata product lines since Delta Sharing doesn‚Äôt require you to build a dedicated service\n\nfor each of your data products like API services would. The company simply grants and\n\nmanages access to the data recipients instead of replicating the data ‚Äî thereby reducing\n\ncomplexity and latency. Any data that exits your ELT/ETL pipelines becomes a candidate\n\nfor a data product. Any data that exists on your platform can be securely shared with your\n\nconsumers. This grants a wider addressable market ‚Äî your products have appeal to a\n\nbroader range of consumers, from those who say ‚Äúwe need access to your raw data only‚Äù\n\nto those who say ‚Äúwe want only small subsets of your Gold layer data.‚Äù\n\nTo mitigate cost concerns, Delta Sharing maintains an audit log that tracks any permitted\n\naccess to the data. Data providers can use this information to determine the costs\n\nassociated with any of the data products and evaluate if such products are commercially\n\nviable and sensible.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### B2B sharing with Delta Sharing\n\nCloud Storage\n\nPartner A\n\nUnity\nCatalog\n\n\nPartner U\n\n\nUnity\nCatalog\n\nCloud Storage\n\nPartner B\n\nN o n - D ata b r i c k s C u s t o m e r\nO n a n y c lo u d o r o n - p r e m i s e s\n\nStorage\n\n\nR/O R/O\n\nR/O\n\n\n**Figure 5:**\nB2B sharing with\nDelta Sharing\n\n\nDelta\nSharing\n\n\n-----\n\nDelta Sharing applies in the case of bidirectional exchange of data.\n\nCompanies use Delta Sharing to incorporate partners and suppliers\n\nseamlessly into their workflows. Traditionally, this is not an easy task.\n\nAn organization typically has no control over how their partners are\n\nimplementing their own data platforms. The complexity increases\n\nwhen we consider that the partners and suppliers can reside in\n\na public cloud, private cloud or an on-premises deployed data\n\nplatform. The choices of platform and architecture are not imposed\n\non your partners and suppliers. Due to its open protocol, Delta\n\nSharing addresses this requirement foundationally. Through a wide\n\narray of existing connectors (and many more being implemented),\n\nyour data can land anywhere your partners and suppliers need to\n\nconsume it.\n\n\nIn addition to the location of data consumer residency, the\n\ncomplexity of data arises as a consideration. The traditional\n\napproach to sharing data using APIs is inflexible and imposes\n\nadditional development cycles on both ends of the exchange in\n\norder to implement both the provider pipelines and consumer\n\npipelines. With Delta Sharing, this problem can be abstracted. Data\n\ncan be shared as soon as it lands in the Delta table and when the\n\nshares and grants are defined. There are no implementation costs\n\non the provider side. On the consumer side, data simply needs\n\nto be ingested and transformed into an expected schema for the\n\ndownstream processes.\n\nThis means that you can form much more agile data exchange\n\npatterns with your partners and suppliers and attain value from your\n\ncombined data much quicker than ever before.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Internal data sharing with Delta Sharing\n\nInternal data sharing is becoming an increasingly important consideration for any modern\n\norganization, particularly where data describing the same concepts have been produced in\n\ndifferent ways and in different data silos across the organization. In this situation it is important\n\nto design systems and platforms that allow governed and intentional federation of data and\n\nprocesses, and at the same time allow easy and seamless integration of said data and processes.\n\nArchitectural design patterns such as Data Mesh have emerged to address these specific\n\nchallenges and considerations. Data Mesh architecture assumes a federated design and\n\ndissemination of ownership and responsibility to business units or divisions. This, in fact, has\n\nseveral advantages, chief among them that data is owned by the parts of the organization closest\n\nto the source of the data. Data residence is naturally enforced since data sits within the geo-\n\nlocality where it has been generated. Finally, data volumes and data variety are kept in control\n\ndue to the localization within a data domain (or data node). On the other hand, the architecture\n\npromotes exchange of data between different data domains when that data is needed to deliver\n\noutcomes and better insights.\n\n\n-----\n\nBusiness Unit 1 Business Unit ,\ni n R e g i o n A i n R e g i o n -\n\nCloud Storage\n\nUnity\nCatalog\n\nR/O R/O\n\n\nUnity\nCatalog\n\nCloud Storage\n\n\nDelta\nSharing\n\n\nBusiness Unit B\n\ni n R e g i o n A\n\n\nDelta\nSharing\n\nR/O R/O\n\n\nCloud Storage\n\nBusiness Unit ÔøΩ\nN o n - D ata b r i c k s C u s t o m e r\n\nO n a n y c lo u d o r o n - p r e m i s e s\n\nStorage\n\n\n**Figure 6:**\nBuilding a Data Mesh\nwith Delta Sharing\n\n\n-----\n\nUnity Catalog enables consolidated data access control across\n\ndifferent data domains within an organization using the Lakehouse\n\non Databricks. In addition, Unity Catalog adds a set of simple and\n\neasy-to-use declarative APIsto govern and control data exchange\n\npatterns between the data domains in the Data Mesh.\n\nTo make matters even more complicated, organizations can grow\n\nthrough mergers and acquisitions. In such cases we cannot assume\n\nthat organizations being acquired have followed the same set of\n\nrules and standards to define their platforms and produce their\n\ndata. Furthermore, we cannot even assume that they have used\n\nthe same cloud providers, nor can we assume the complexity of\n\ntheir data models. Delta Sharing can simplify and accelerate the\n\n\nunification and assimilation of newly acquired organizations and\n\ntheir data and processes.. Individual organizations can be treated\n\nas new data domains in the overarching mesh. Only selected data\n\nsources can be exchanged between the different platforms. This\n\nenables teams to move freely between the organizations that are\n\nmerging without losing their data ‚Äî if anything, they are empowered\n\nto drive insights of higher quality by combining the data of both.\n\nWith Unity Catalog and Delta Sharing, the Lakehouse architecture\n\nseamlessly combines with the Data Mesh architecture to deliver\n\nmore power than ever before, pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs\n\npossible and simplifying activities that were deemed daunting not\n\nso long ago.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Chapter 4\n How Delta Sharing Works\n\n\nDelta Sharing is designed to be simple, scalable, nonproprietary\n\nand cost-effective for organizations that are serious about getting\n\nmore from their data. Delta Sharing is natively integrated with Unity\n\nCatalog, which enables customers to add fine-grained governance\n\nand security controls, making it easy and safe to share data\n\n\nDelta Sharing is a simple REST protocol that securely grants\n\ntemporary access to part of a cloud data set. It leverages modern\n\ncloud storage systems ‚Äî such as AWS S3, Azure ADLS or Google‚Äôs\n\nGCS ‚Äî to reliably grant read-only access to large data sets. Here‚Äôs\n\nhow it works for data providers and data recipients.\n\n\ninternally or externally.\n\nData PJQIiLeJ Data Recipient\n\nAccess permissions\n\nRequest table\n\nPre-signed short-lived URLs\n\n\nDelta Lake\n\nParquet `iles\n\n\nDelta Sharing Server\n\n\n**Figure 7:**\nHow Delta Sharing\nworks connecting data\nproviders and data\nrecipients\n\n\nTemporary direct access to fles Parquet ormatt\nin the object store ‚Äî AWS S3, GCP, ADLS\n\n\n\n-  ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢\nDelta Sharing Client\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Data providers\n\nThe data provider shares existing tables or parts thereof (such as\n\nspecific table versions or partitions) stored on the cloud data lake\n\nin Delta Lake format. The provider decides what data they want to\n\nshare and runs a sharing server in front of it that implements the\n\nDelta Sharing protocol and manages recipient access. . To manage\n\nshares and recipients, you can use SQL commands,the Unity\n\nCatalog CLI or the intuitive user interface.\n\n#### Data recipients\n\nThe data recipient only needs one of the many Delta Sharing clients\n\nthat support the protocol. Databricks has released open source\n\nconnectors for pandas, Apache Spark, Java and Python, and is\n\nworking with partners on many more.\n\n\n#### The data exchange\n\nThe Delta Sharing data exchange follows three efficient steps:\n\n**1.** \u0007The recipient‚Äôs client authenticates to the sharing server and\n\nasks to query a specific table. The client can also provide filters\n\non the data (for example, ‚Äúcountry=US‚Äù) as a hint to read just a\n\nsubset of the data.\n\n**2.** \u0007The server verifies whether the client is allowed to access the\n\ndata, logs the request, and then determines which data to send\n\nback. This will be a subset of the data objects in cloud storage\n\nsystems that make up the table.\n\n**3.** \u0007To allow temporary access to the data, the server generates\n\nshort-lived presigned URLs that allow the client to read Parquet\n\nfiles directly from the cloud provider so that the read-only\n\naccess can happen in parallel at massive bandwidth, without\n\nstreaming through the sharing server.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Chapter 5\n Introducing Databricks Marketplace\n\n\nEnterprises need open collaboration for data and AI. Data sharing\n\n‚Äî within an organization or externally ‚Äî allows companies to\n\ncollaborate with partners, establish new partnerships and generate\n\nnew revenue streams with data monetization.\n\nThe demand for generative AI is driving disruption across industries,\n\nincreasing the urgency for technical teams to build generative AI\n\nmodels and Large Language Models (LLMs) on top of their own data\n\nto differentiate their offerings.\n\n\nTraditional data marketplaces are restricted and offer only data or\n\nsimple applications, therefore limiting their value to data consumers.\n\nThey also don‚Äôt offer tools to evaluate the data assets beyond basic\n\ndescriptions or examples. Finally, data delivery is limited, often\n\nrequiring ETL or a proprietary delivery mechanism.\n\nEnterprises need a better way to share data and AI that is flexible,\n\nsecure and unlocks business value. An ecosystem makes data\n\nsharing and collaboration powerful.\n\n\n**Today, data marketplaces present many challenges and collaboration can be complex for both data consumers and data providers.**\n\n**Data Consumers** **Data Providers**\n\n\nFocus on data only\nor simple applications\n\nLengthy discovery and\nevaluation\n\nDelayed time-to-insights\nwith vendor lock-in\n\n\nLimited opportunities to\n\nmonetize new types of assets\n\n\nLimited opportunities to\n\n\nDifficulty reaching\n\nmore users\n\n\nDifficulty reaching\n\n\nLack of secure technology\n\nand unified governance\n\n\nLack of secure technology\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Challenges in today's data marketplaces\n\n**Data Consumers** **Data Providers**\n\n\n\u0007 **Focus on data only or simple applications:** Accessing only\n\ndata sets means organizations looking to take advantage of\n\nAI/ML need to look elsewhere or start from scratch, causing\n\ndelays in driving business insights.\n\n\u0007 **Lengthy discovery and evaluation:** The tools most\n\nmarketplaces provide for data consumers to evaluate data\n\nare simply descriptions and example SQL statements. Minimal\n\n\n\u0007 **Limited opportunities to monetize new types of assets:**\n\nA data-only approach means organizations are limited to\n\nmonetizing anything beyond a data set and will face more\n\nfriction to create new revenue opportunities with non-\n\ncompatible platforms.\n\n**Difficulty reaching more users:** Data providers must choose\n\nbetween forgoing potential business or incurring the expense\n\nof replicating data.\n\n\nevaluation tools mean it takes more time to figure out if a data\n\nproduct is right for you, which might include more time in\n\nback-and-forth messages with a provider or searching for a\n\nnew provider altogether.\n\n\n**Delayed time-to-insights with vendor lock-in:** Delivery\n\nthrough proprietary sharing technologies or FTP means either\n\nvendor lock-in or lengthy ETL processes to get the data where\n\nyou need to work with it.\n\n\n**Lack of secure technology and unified governance:** Without\n\nopen standards for sharing data securely across platforms\n\nand clouds, data providers must use multiple tools to secure\n\naccess to scattered data, leading to inconsistent governance.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### What is Databricks Marketplace?\n\n\napproach allows you to put your data to work more quickly in\n\nevery cloud with your tools of choice.\n\nMarketplace brings together a vast ecosystem of data\n\nconsumers and data providers to collaborate across a wide\n\narray of data sets without platform dependencies, complicated\n\nETL, expensive replication and vendor lock-in.\n\n\nDatabricks Marketplace is an open marketplace for all your data,\n\nanalytics and AI, powered by Delta Sharing.\n\nSince Marketplace is powered by Delta Sharing, you can benefit\n\nfrom open source flexibility and no vendor lock-in, enabling you\n\nto collaborate across all platforms, clouds and regions.

However, most organizations are new to AI.\n\nDatabricks has heard from customers that they want to discover\n\nout-of-the-box AI models on Marketplace to help them kickstart\n\ntheir AI innovation journey.\n\nTo meet this demand, Databricks will be adding AI model sharing\n\ncapabilities on Marketplace to provide users access to both OSS\n\nand proprietary AI (both first-and third-party) models. This will\n\nenable data consumers and providers to discover and monetize AI\n\nmodels and integrate AI into their data solutions.\n\n\nUsing this feature, data consumers can evaluate AI models with\n\nrich previews, including visualizations and pre-built notebooks with\n\nsample data. With Databricks Marketplace, there are no difficult\n\ndata delivery mechanisms ‚Äî you can get the AI models instantly\n\nwith the click of a button. All of this works out-of-the-box with the AI\n\ncapabilities of the Databricks Lakehouse Platform for both real-time\n\nand batch inference. For real-time inference, you can use model\n\nserving endpoints. For batch inference, you can invoke the models\n\nas functions directly from DBSQL or notebooks.\n\nWith AI model sharing, Databricks customers will have access\n\nto best-in-class models from leading providers, as well as OSS\n\nmodels published by Databricks which can be quickly and securely\n\napplied on top of their data. Databricks will curate and publish\n\nits own open source models across common use cases, such as\n\ninstruction-following and text summarization, and optimize tuning or\n\ndeployment of these models.\n\nUsing AI models from Databricks Marketplace can help your\n\norganization summarize complex information quickly and easily to\n\nhelp accelerate the pace of innovation.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Chapter 6\n Share securely with Databricks Clean Rooms\n\n\nWhile the demand for external data to make data-driven\n\ninnovations is greater than ever, there is growing concern among\n\norganizations around data privacy. The need for organizations to\n\nshare data and collaborate with their partners and customers in a\n\nsecure, governed and privacy-centric way is driving the concept\n\nof ‚Äúdata clean rooms.‚Äù\n\n\n#### What is a data clean room?\n\nA data clean room provides a secure, governed and privacy-safe\n\nenvironment where participants can bring their sensitive data, which\n\nmight include personally identifiable information (PII), and perform\n\njoint analysis on that private data. Participants have full control\n\nof the data and can decide which participants can perform what\n\nanalysis without exposing any sensitive data.\n\n\n###### Collaborator A\n Data Cleanroom\nE.G., AGENCIES, PUBLISHERS, MVPDS, RETAILERS\n\n\u0007What is our audience overlap?\n\n\n###### Collaborator B\n\nE.G., ADVERTISERTS\n\n\n**Figure 8:**\nData clean room\ndiagram example\nfor audience\noverlap analysis in\nadvertising\n\n\nHow did my campaign do in\n\nterms of reach and frequency?\n\n\n\u0007What is the lift in purchases\n\namong those in-segment versus\nthose out-of-segment?\n\n**Collaborator A-owned sensitive data** **Secure and privacy-preserving environment** **Collaborator B-owned sensitive data**\n\n\n-----\n\nA data clean room is not a new concept. Google introduced the idea in 2017 when it announced Ads Data Hub, which allows\n\nadvertisers to gain impression-level insights about cross-device media campaigns in a more secure, privacy-safe environment. In\n\nthe last few years, the demand for clean rooms has accelerated. IDC predicts that by 2024, 65% of G2000 enterprises will form data\n\nsharing partnerships with external stakeholders via data clean rooms to increase interdependence while safeguarding data privacy.\n\nThere are various compelling needs driving this demand:\n\n\n**Privacy-first world.** Stringent data privacy regulations such as\n\nGDPR and CCPA, along with sweeping changes in third-party\n\nmeasurement, have transformed how organizations collect, use\n\nand share data. For example, Apple‚Äôs [App Tracking Transparency](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/)\n\n[Framework](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/) (ATT) provides users of Apple devices the freedom\n\nand flexibility to easily opt out of app tracking. Google also plans\n\nto [phase out support for third-party cookies in Chrome](https://blog.google/products/chrome/updated-timeline-privacy-sandbox-milestones/) by late\n\n2024. As these privacy laws and practices evolve, the demand\n\nfor data cleanrooms is likely to rise as the industry moves to new\n\n\n**Collaboration in a fragmented ecosystem.** Today, consumers have\n\nmore options than ever before when it comes to where, when and\n\nhow they engage with content. As a result, the digital footprint of\n\nconsumers is fragmented across different platforms, necessitating\n\nthat companies collaborate with their partners to create a unified\n\nview of their customers‚Äô needs and requirements. To facilitate\n\ncollaboration across organizations, cleanrooms provide a secure\n\nand private way to combine their data with other data to unlock new\n\ninsights or capabilities.\n\n\nidentifiers that are PII based, such as UID 2.0, and organizations\n\ntry to find new ways to share and join data with customers and\n\npartners in a privacy-centric way.\n\n**New ways to monetize data.** Most organizations are looking to\n\nmonetize their data in one form or another. With today‚Äôs privacy\n\nlaws, companies will try to find any possible advantages to monetize\n\ntheir data without the risk of breaking privacy rules. This creates an\n\nopportunity for data vendors or publishers to join data for big data\n\nanalytics without having direct access to the data.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Common data clean room uses cases\n\n\n#### Category management for retail and consumer goods\n\nClean rooms enable real-time collaboration between retailers\n\nand suppliers, ensuring secure information exchange for demand\n\nforecasting, inventory planning and supply chain optimization.\n\nThis improves product availability, reduces costs and streamlines\n\noperations for both parties.\n\n#### Real-world evidence (RWE) for healthcare\n\nClean rooms provide secure access to sensitive healthcare data sets,\n\nallowing collaborators to connect and query multiple sources of data\n\nwithout comprising data privacy. This supports RWE use cases such\n\nas regulatory decisions, safety, clinical trial design and observational\n\nresearch.\n\n\n#### Audience overlap exploration for media and entertainment\n\nBy creating a clean room environment, media companies can\n\nsecurely share their audience data with advertisers or other media\n\npartners. This allows them to perform in-depth analysis and identify\n\nshared audience segments without directly accessing or exposing\n\nindividual user information.\n\n#### Know Your Customer (KYC) in banking\n\nKYC standards are designed to combat financial fraud, money\n\nlaundering and terrorism financing. Clean rooms can be used within a\n\ngiven jurisdiction to allow financial services companies to collaborate\n\nand run shared analytics to build a holistic view of a transaction for\n\ninvestigations.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Personalization with expanded interests for retailers\n\nRetailers want to target consumers based on past purchases, as\n\nwell as other purchases with different retailers. Clean rooms enable\n\nretailers to augment their knowledge of consumers to suggest new\n\nproducts and services that are relevant to the individual but have\n\n\n#### 5G data monetization for telecom\n\n5G data monetization enables telecoms to capitalize on data\n\nfrom 5G networks. Clean rooms provide a secure environment\n\nfor collaboration with trusted partners, ensuring privacy while\n\nmaximizing data value for optimized services, personalized\n\nexperiences and targeted advertising.\n\n\nnot yet been purchased.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Shortcomings of existing data clean rooms\n\n\nOrganizations exploring clean room options are finding some glaring\n\nshortcomings in the existing solutions that limit the full potential of the\n\n‚Äúclean rooms‚Äù concept.\n\nFirst, many existing data clean room vendors require data to be on the\n\nsame cloud, same region, and/or same data platform. Participants then\n\nhave to move data into proprietary platforms, which results in lock-in\n\nand additional data storage costs.\n\n\nSecond, most existing solutions are not scalable to expand\n\ncollaboration beyond a few collaborators at a time. For example,\n\nan advertiser might want to get a detailed view of their ad\n\nperformance across different platforms, which requires analysis\n\nof the aggregated data from multiple data publishers. With\n\ncollaboration limited to just a few participants, organizations get\n\npartial insights on one clean room platform and end up moving\n\ntheir data to another clean room vendor to aggregate the data,\n\nincurring the operational overhead of collating partial insights.\n\nFinally, existing clean room solutions do not provide the flexibility\n\nto run arbitrary analysis and are mainly restricted to SQL, a\n\nsubset of Python, and pre-defined templates. While SQL is\n\nabsolutely needed for clean rooms, there are times when you\n\nrequire complex computations such as machine learning or\n\nintegration with APIs where SQL doesn‚Äôt satisfy the full depth of\n\nthe technical requirements.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Key benefits of Databricks Clean Rooms\n\nDatabricks Clean Rooms allow businesses to easily collaborate with their customers and partners in a secure environment on\n\nany cloud in a privacy-safe way. Key benefits of Databricks Clean Rooms include:\n\n\n**Flexible - your language and workload of**\n\n**choice.** Databricks Clean Rooms empower\n\ncollaborators to share and join their existing\n\ndata and run complex workloads in any\n\nlanguage ‚ÄîPython, R, SQL, Java and Scala ‚Äî\n\non the data while maintaining data privacy.\n\nBeyond traditional SQL, users can run arbitrary\n\nworkloads and languages, allowing them to train\n\nmachine learning models, perform inference\n\nand utilize open-source or third-party privacy-\n\nenhancing technologies.

Because of the ACID transactional protections that\nDelta Lake provides, you‚Äôre able to get the reliability and performance you need.\n\nWith Delta Lake, you can stream and batch concurrently, perform CRUD operations,\nand save money because you‚Äôre now using fewer VMs. It‚Äôs easier to maintain your data\nengineering pipelines by taking advantage of streaming, even for batch jobs.\n\nDelta Lake is a storage layer that brings reliability to your data lakes built on HDFS and\ncloud object storage by providing ACID transactions through optimistic concurrency\ncontrol between writes and snapshot isolation for consistent reads during writes.\nDelta Lake also provides built-in data versioning for easy rollbacks and reproducing\nreports.\n\nIn this chapter, we‚Äôll share some of the common challenges with data lakes as well as\nthe Delta Lake features that address them.\n\n**Challenges with data lakes**\nData lakes are a common element within modern data architectures. They serve as a\ncentral ingestion point for the plethora of data that organizations seek to gather and\nmine. While a good step forward in getting to grips with the range of data, they run\ninto the following common problems:\n\n\n-----\n\n**1. \u0007Reading and writing into data lakes is not reliable.** Data engineers often run into\nthe problem of unsafe writes into data lakes that cause readers to see garbage\ndata during writes. They have to build workarounds to ensure readers always see\nconsistent data during writes.\n\n**2. \u0007The data quality in data lakes is low.** Dumping unstructured data into a data\nlake is easy, but this comes at the cost of data quality. Without any mechanisms\nfor validating schema and the data, data lakes suffer from poor data quality. As a\nconsequence, analytics projects that strive to mine this data also fail.\n\n**3. Poor performance with increasing amounts of data.** As the amount of data\nthat gets dumped into a data lake increases, the number of files and directories\nalso increases. Big data jobs and query engines that process the data spend a\nsignificant amount of time handling the metadata operations. This problem is more\npronounced in the case of streaming jobs or handling many concurrent batch jobs.\n\n**4. \u0007Modifying, updating or deleting records in data lakes is hard.** Engineers need to\nbuild complicated pipelines to read entire partitions or tables, modify the data and\nwrite them back. Such pipelines are inefficient and hard to maintain.\n\nBecause of these challenges, many big data projects fail to deliver on their vision or\nsometimes just fail altogether. We need a solution that enables data practitioners to\nmake use of their existing data lakes, while ensuring data quality.\n\n**Delta Lake‚Äôs key functionalities**\nDelta Lake addresses the above problems to simplify how you build your data lakes.\nDelta Lake offers the following key functionalities:\n\n**‚Ä¢ ACID transactions:** Delta Lake provides ACID transactions between multiple\nwrites. Every write is a transaction, and there is a serial order for writes recorded in\na transaction log. The transaction log tracks writes at file level and uses [optimistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control)\n\n\n-----\n\n[concurrency control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control) , which is ideally suited for data lakes since multiple writes\ntrying to modify the same files don‚Äôt happen that often. In scenarios where\nthere is a conflict, Delta Lake throws a concurrent modification exception for\nusers to handle them and retry their jobs. Delta Lake also offers the highest level\nof isolation possible ( [serializable isolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(database_systems)#Serializable) ) that allows engineers to continuously\nkeep writing to a directory or table and consumers to keep reading from the same\ndirectory or table. Readers will see the latest snapshot that existed at the time the\nreading started.\n\n**‚Ä¢ \u0007Schema management:** Delta Lake automatically validates that the schema of the\nDataFrame being written is compatible with the schema of the table. Columns that\nare present in the table but not in the DataFrame are set to null. If there are extra\ncolumns in the DataFrame that are not present in the table, this operation throws\nan exception. Delta Lake has DDL to add new columns explicitly and the ability to\nupdate the schema automatically.\n\n**‚Ä¢ \u0007Scalable metadata handling:** Delta Lake stores the metadata information of\na table or directory in the transaction log instead of the metastore. This allows\nDelta Lake to list files in large directories in constant time and be efficient while\nreading data.\n\n**‚Ä¢ Data versioning and time travel:** Delta Lake allows users to read a previous\nsnapshot of the table or directory. When files are modified during writes, Delta\nLake creates newer versions of the files and preserves the older versions. When\n\n\nusers want to read the older versions of the table or directory, they can provide\na timestamp or a version number to Apache Spark‚Äôs read APIs, and Delta Lake\nconstructs the full snapshot as of that timestamp or version based on the\ninformation in the transaction log. This allows users to reproduce experiments and\nreports and also revert a table to its older versions, if needed.\n\n**‚Ä¢ Unified batch and streaming sink:** Apart from batch writes, Delta Lake can also\nbe used as an efficient streaming sink with [Apache Spark‚Äôs structured streaming](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html) .\nCombined with ACID transactions and scalable metadata handling, the efficient\nstreaming sink enables lots of near real-time analytics use cases without having to\nmaintain a complicated streaming and batch pipeline.\n\n**‚Ä¢ Record update and deletion:** Delta Lake will support merge, update and delete\nDML commands. This allows engineers to easily upsert and delete records in data\nlakes and simplify their change data capture and GDPR use cases. Since Delta Lake\ntracks and modifies data at file-level granularity, it is much more efficient than\nreading and overwriting entire partitions or tables.\n\n**‚Ä¢ Data expectations (coming soon):** Delta Lake will also support a new API to set\ndata expectations on tables or directories. Engineers will be able to specify a\nboolean condition and tune the severity to handle data expectations. When Apache\nSpark jobs write to the table or directory, Delta Lake will automatically validate\nthe records and when there is a violation, it will handle the records based on the\nseverity provided.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Unpacking the**\n**Transaction Log**\n\nThe transaction log is key to understanding Delta Lake because it is the common thread\nthat runs through many of its most important features, including ACID transactions,\nscalable metadata handling, time travel and more. The Delta Lake transaction log is\nan ordered record of every transaction that has ever been performed on a Delta Lake\ntable since its inception.\n\nDelta Lake is built on top of [Apache Spark](https://databricks.com/spark/about) to allow multiple readers and writers of a\ngiven table to work on the table at the same time. To show users correct views of the\ndata at all times, the transaction log serves as a single source of truth: the central\nrepository that tracks all changes that users make to the table.\n\nWhen a user reads a Delta Lake table for the first time or runs a new query on an\nopen table that has been modified since the last time it was read, Spark checks the\ntransaction log to see what new transactions are posted to the table. Then, Spark\nupdates the end user‚Äôs table with those new changes. This ensures that a user‚Äôs\nversion of a table is always synchronized with the master record as of the most recent\nquery and that users cannot make divergent, conflicting changes to a table.\n\nIn this chapter, we‚Äôll explore how the Delta Lake transaction log offers an elegant\nsolution to the problem of multiple concurrent reads and writes.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Implementing atomicity to ensure**\n**operations complete fully**\nAtomicity is one of the four properties of ACID transactions that guarantees that\noperations (like an INSERT or UPDATE) performed on your [data lake](https://databricks.com/glossary/data-lake) either complete\nfully or don‚Äôt complete at all. Without this property, it‚Äôs far too easy for a hardware\nfailure or a software bug to cause data to be only partially written to a table, resulting\nin messy or corrupted data.\n\nThe transaction log is the mechanism through which Delta Lake is able to offer\nthe guarantee of atomicity. For all intents and purposes, if it‚Äôs not recorded in the\ntransaction log, it never happened. By only recording transactions that execute fully\nand completely, and using that record as the single source of truth, the Delta Lake\ntransaction log allows users to reason about their data and have peace of mind about\nits fundamental trustworthiness, at petabyte scale.\n\n**Dealing with multiple concurrent reads and writes**\nBut how does Delta Lake deal with multiple concurrent reads and writes? Since Delta\nLake is powered by Apache Spark, it‚Äôs not only possible for multiple users to modify a\n\n\ntable at once ‚Äî it‚Äôs expected. To handle these situations, Delta Lake employs **optimistic**\n**concurrency control** .\n\nOptimistic concurrency control is a method of dealing with concurrent transactions\nthat assumes the changes made to a table by different users can complete without\nconflicting with one another. It is incredibly fast because when dealing with petabytes\nof data, there‚Äôs a high likelihood that users will be working on different parts of the data\naltogether, allowing them to complete non-conflicting transactions simultaneously.\n\nOf course, even with optimistic concurrency control, sometimes users do try to\nmodify the same parts of the data at the same time. Luckily, Delta Lake has a protocol\nfor that. Delta Lake handles these cases by implementing a rule of mutual exclusion,\nthen it attempts to solve any conflict optimistically.\n\nThis protocol allows Delta Lake to deliver on the ACID principle of isolation, which\nensures that the resulting state of the table after multiple, concurrent writes is the\nsame as if those writes had occurred serially, in isolation from one another.\n\n\n-----\n\nAs all the transactions made on Delta Lake tables are stored directly to disk, this\nprocess satisfies the ACID property of durability, meaning it will persist even in the\nevent of system failure.\n\n**Time travel, data lineage and debugging**\nEvery table is the result of the sum total of all the commits recorded in the Delta Lake\ntransaction log ‚Äî no more and no less. The transaction log provides a step-by-step\ninstruction guide, detailing exactly how to get from the table‚Äôs original state to its\ncurrent state.\n\nTherefore, we can recreate the state of a table at any point in time by starting with\nan original table, and processing only commits made after that point. This powerful\nability is known as ‚Äútime travel,‚Äù or data versioning, and can be a lifesaver in any number\n\n\nof situations.

It can also be used to trace the origin of an\ninadvertent change or a bug in a pipeline back to the exact action that caused it. Users\ncan run the [DESCRIBE HISTORY](https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-utility.html#describe-history) command to see metadata around the changes\nthat were made.\n\n**Want to learn more about Delta Lake‚Äôs transaction log?**\n\nRead our blog post >   Watch our tech talk >\n\n\n-----\n\n**How to Use Schema**\n**Enforcement and**\n**Evolution**\n\nAs business problems and requirements evolve over time, so does the structure of\nyour data. With Delta Lake, incorporating new columns or objects is easy; users have\naccess to simple semantics to control the schema of their tables. At the same time,\nit is important to call out the importance of schema enforcement to prevent users\nfrom accidentally polluting their tables with mistakes or garbage data in addition to\nschema evolution, which enables them to automatically add new columns of rich data\nwhen those columns belong.\n\n**Schema enforcement rejects any new columns or other schema changes that**\n**aren‚Äôt compatible with your table.** By setting and upholding these high standards,\nanalysts and engineers can trust that their data has the highest levels of integrity and\ncan reason about it with clarity, allowing them to make better business decisions.\n\nOn the flip side of the coin, schema evolution complements enforcement by making it\neasy for intended schema changes to take place automatically. After all, it shouldn‚Äôt\nbe hard to add a column.\n\nSchema enforcement is the yin to schema evolution‚Äôs yang. When used together,\nthese features make it easier than ever to block out the noise and tune in to the signal.\n\n**Understanding table schemas**\nEvery DataFrame in Apache Spark contains a schema, a blueprint that defines the\nshape of the data, such as data types and columns, and metadata. With Delta Lake,\nthe table‚Äôs schema is saved in JSON format inside the transaction log.\n\n\n-----\n\n**What is schema enforcement?**\nSchema enforcement, or schema validation, is a safeguard in Delta Lake that ensures\ndata quality by rejecting writes to a table that don‚Äôt match the table‚Äôs schema.\n\nLike the front-desk manager at a busy restaurant who only accepts reservations, it\nchecks to see whether each column of data inserted into the table is on its list of\nexpected columns (in other words, whether each one has a ‚Äúreservation‚Äù), and rejects\nany writes with columns that aren‚Äôt on the list.\n\n**How does schema enforcement work?**\nDelta Lake uses **schema validation on write,** which means that all new writes to a\ntable are checked for compatibility with the target table‚Äôs schema at write time. If the\nschema is not compatible, Delta Lake cancels the transaction altogether (no data is\nwritten), and raises an exception to let the user know about the mismatch.\n\nTo determine whether a write to a table is compatible, Delta Lake uses the following\nrules. The DataFrame to be written cannot contain:\n\n**‚Ä¢ Any additional columns that are not present in the target table‚Äôs schema.**\nConversely, it‚Äôs OK if the incoming data doesn‚Äôt contain every column in the table ‚Äî\nthose columns will simply be assigned null values.\n\n**‚Ä¢ \u0007Column data types that differ from the column data types in the target table.**\nIf a target table‚Äôs column contains StringType data, but the corresponding column\nin the DataFrame contains IntegerType data, schema enforcement will raise an\nexception and prevent the write operation from taking place.\n\n**‚Ä¢ Column names that differ only by case.** This means that you cannot have columns\nsuch as ‚ÄúFoo‚Äù and ‚Äúfoo‚Äù defined in the same table. While Spark can be used in case\nsensitive or insensitive (default) mode, Delta Lake is case-preserving but insensitive\nwhen storing the schema. [Parquet](https://databricks.com/glossary/what-is-parquet) is case sensitive when storing and returning\ncolumn information. To avoid potential mistakes, data corruption or loss issues (which\nwe‚Äôve personally experienced at Databricks), we decided to add this restriction.\n\n\n-----\n\nRather than automatically adding the new columns, Delta Lake enforces the schema,\nand stops the write from occurring. To help identify which column(s) caused the\nmismatch, Spark prints out both schemas in the stack trace for comparison.\n\n**How is schema enforcement useful?**\nBecause it‚Äôs such a stringent check, schema enforcement is an excellent tool to use\nas a gatekeeper for a clean, fully transformed data set that is ready for production or\nconsumption. It‚Äôs typically enforced on tables that directly feed:\n\n-  Machine learning algorithms\n\n-  BI dashboards\n\n-  Data analytics and visualization tools\n\n-  Any production system requiring highly structured,\nstrongly typed, semantic schemas\n\nIn order to prepare their data for this final hurdle, many users employ a simple multihop architecture that progressively adds structure to their tables. To learn more, take\na look at [Productionizing Machine Learning With Delta Lake.](https://databricks.com/blog/2019/08/14/productionizing-machine-learning-with-delta-lake.html)\n\n**What is schema evolution?**\nSchema evolution is a feature that allows users to easily change a table‚Äôs current\nschema to accommodate data that is changing over time. Most commonly, it‚Äôs used\nwhen performing an append or overwrite operation, to automatically adapt the\nschema to include one or more new columns.\n\n**How does schema evolution work?**\nFollowing up on the example from the previous section, developers can\neasily use schema evolution to add the new columns that were previously\nrejected due to a schema mismatch. Schema evolution is activated by adding\n.option(‚ÄòmergeSchema‚Äô, ‚Äòtrue‚Äô) to your .write or .writeStream\nSpark command, as shown in the following example.\n\n\n#Add the mergeSchema option\n\nloans.write.format( ‚Äúdelta‚Äù ) \\\n\n.option( ‚ÄúmergeSchema‚Äù , ‚Äútrue‚Äù ) \\\n\n.mode( ‚Äúappend‚Äù ) \\\n\n.save(DELTALAKE_SILVER_PATH)\n\nBy including the mergeSchema option in your query, any columns that are present\n\nin the DataFrame but not in the target table are automatically added to the end of the\n\nschema as part of a write transaction. Nested fields can also be added, and these\n\nfields will get added to the end of their respective struct columns as well.\n\nData engineers and scientists can use this option to add new columns (perhaps a\n\nnewly tracked metric, or a column of this month‚Äôs sales figures) to their existing ML\n\nproduction tables without breaking existing models that rely on the old columns.\n\nThe following types of schema changes are eligible for schema evolution during table\n\nappends or overwrites:\n\n-  Adding new columns (this is the most common scenario)\n\n-  \u0007Changing of data types from NullType ‚Üí any other type, or upcasts from ByteType\n\n‚Üí ShortType ‚Üí IntegerType\n\nOther changes, not eligible for schema evolution, require that the schema and data\n\nare overwritten by adding .option(‚ÄúoverwriteSchema‚Äù,‚Äútrue‚Äù) . Those\n\nchanges include:\n\n-  Dropping a column\n\n-  Changing an existing column‚Äôs data typeC (in place)\n\n-  \u0007Renaming column names that differ onlyC by case (e.g., ‚ÄúFoo‚Äù and ‚Äúfoo‚Äù)\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally, with the release of Spark 3.0, explicit DDL (using ALTER TABLE ) is fully\nsupported, allowing users to perform the following actions on table schemas:\n\n-  Adding columns\n\n-  Changing column comments\n\n-  Setting table properties that define the behavior of the table, such as setting the\nretention duration of the transaction log\n\n**How is schema evolution useful?**\nSchema evolution can be used anytime you _intend_ to change the schema of your table\n(as opposed to where you accidentally added columns to your DataFrame that shouldn‚Äôt\nbe there). It‚Äôs the easiest way to migrate your schema because it automatically adds the\ncorrect column names and data types, without having to declare them explicitly.\n\n**Summary**\nSchema enforcement rejects any new columns or other schema changes that\naren‚Äôt compatible with your table. By setting and upholding these high standards,\nanalysts and engineers can trust that their data has the highest levels of integrity and\ncan reason about it with clarity, allowing them to make better business decisions.\nOn the flip side of the coin, schema evolution complements enforcement by making it\neasy for intended schema changes to take place automatically. After all, it shouldn‚Äôt\nbe hard to add a column.\n\nSchema enforcement is the yin to schema evolution‚Äôs yang. When used together, these\nfeatures make it easier than ever to block out the noise and tune in to the signal.\n\n**Want to learn more about schema enforcement and evolution?**\n\nRead our blog post >  Watch our tech talk >\n\n\n-----\n\n**Delta Lake**\n**DML Internals**\n\nDelta Lake supports data manipulation language (DML) commands including UPDATE,\nDELETE and MERGE. These commands simplify change data capture (CDC), audit and\ngovernance, and GDPR/CCPA workflows, among others.\n\nIn this chapter, we will demonstrate how to use each of these DML commands,\ndescribe what Delta Lake is doing behind the scenes, and offer some performance\ntuning tips for each one.\n\n**Delta Lake DML: UPDATE**\nYou can use the UPDATE operation to selectively update any rows that match a\nfiltering condition, also known as a predicate. The code below demonstrates how\nto use each type of predicate as part of an UPDATE statement. Note that Delta Lake\noffers APIs for Python, Scala and SQL, but for the purposes of this eBook, we‚Äôll include\nonly the SQL code.\n\n-- Update events\n\nUPDATE events SET eventType= ‚Äòclick‚Äô WHERE buttonPress = 1\n\n\n-----\n\n**UPDATE: Under the hood**\nDelta Lake performs an UPDATE on a table in two steps:\n\n1. Find and select the files containing data that match the predicate and, therefore,\nneed to be updated. Delta Lake uses [data skipping](https://docs.databricks.com/delta/optimizations/file-mgmt.html#data-skipping) whenever possible to speed up\nthis process.\n\n2. \u0007Read each matching file into memory, update the relevant rows, and write out the\nresult into a new data file.\n\nOnce Delta Lake has executed the UPDATE successfully, it adds a commit in the\ntransaction log indicating that the new data file will be used in place of the old one\nfrom now on. The old data file is not deleted, though. Instead, it‚Äôs simply ‚Äútombstoned‚Äù\n‚Äî recorded as a data file that applied to an older version of the table, but not the\ncurrent version. Delta Lake is able to use it to provide data versioning and time travel.\n\n**UPDATE + Delta Lake time travel = Easy debugging**\nKeeping the old data files turns out to be very useful for debugging because you can\nuse Delta Lake ‚Äútime travel‚Äù to go back and query previous versions of a table at any\n\n\ntime. In the event that you update your table incorrectly and want to figure out what\nhappened, you can easily compare two versions of a table to one another to see what\nhas changed.\n\nSELECT -  FROM events VERSION AS OF 11 EXCEPT ALL SELECT\n\n-  FROM mytable VERSION AS OF 12\n\n**UPDATE: Performance tuning tips**\nThe main way to improve the performance of the UPDATE command on Delta Lake\nis to add more predicates to narrow down the search space. The more specific the\nsearch, the fewer files Delta Lake needs to scan and/or modify.\n\n**Delta Lake DML: DELETE**\nYou can use the DELETE command to selectively delete rows based upon a\npredicate (filtering condition).\n\nDELETE FROM events WHERE date < ‚Äò2017-01-01‚Äô\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the event that you want to revert an accidental DELETE operation, you can use time\ntravel to roll back your table to the way it was.\n\n**DELETE: Under the hood**\nDELETE works just like UPDATE under the hood. Delta Lake makes two scans of\nthe data: The first scan is to identify any data files that contain rows matching the\npredicate condition. The second scan reads the matching data files into memory,\nat which point Delta Lake deletes the rows in question before writing out the newly\nclean data to disk.\n\nAfter Delta Lake completes a DELETE operation successfully, the old data files are\nnot deleted entirely ‚Äî they‚Äôre still retained on disk, but recorded as ‚Äútombstoned‚Äù (no\nlonger part of the active table) in the Delta Lake transaction log. Remember, those old\nfiles aren‚Äôt deleted immediately because you might still need them to time travel back\nto an earlier version of the table. If you want to delete files older than a certain time\nperiod, you can use the VACUUM command.\n\n**DELETE + VACUUM: Cleaning up old data files**\nRunning the VACUUM command permanently deletes all data files that are:\n\n1. No longer part of the active table and\n2. \u0007Older than the retention threshold, which is seven days by default\n\nDelta Lake does not automatically VACUUM old files ‚Äî you must run the command\nyourself, as shown below. If you want to specify a retention period that is different\nfrom the default of seven days, you can provide it as a parameter.\n\nfrom delta.tables import -  deltaTable.\n\n# vacuum files older than 30 days(720 hours)\n\ndeltaTable.vacuum( 720 )\n\n\n-----\n\n**DELETE: Performance tuning tips**\nJust like with the UPDATE command, the main way to improve the performance of\na DELETE operation on Delta Lake is to add more predicates to narrow down the\nsearch space. The Databricks managed version of Delta Lake also features other\nperformance enhancements like improved [data skipping](https://docs.databricks.com/delta/optimizations/file-mgmt.html#data-skipping) , the use of bloom filters, and\n[Z-Order Optimize](https://docs.databricks.com/delta/optimizations/file-mgmt.html#z-ordering-multi-dimensional-clustering) (multi-dimensional clustering). [Read more about Z-Order Optimize](https://docs.databricks.com/delta/optimizations/file-mgmt.html#z-ordering-multi-dimensional-clustering)\n[on Databricks.](https://docs.databricks.com/delta/optimizations/file-mgmt.html#z-ordering-multi-dimensional-clustering)\n\n**Delta Lake DML: MERGE**\nThe Delta Lake MERGE command allows you to perform upserts, which are a mix of\nan UPDATE and an INSERT. To understand upserts, imagine that you have an existing\ntable (aka a target table), and a source table that contains a mix of new records and\nupdates to existing records.\n\n\n**Here‚Äôs how an upsert works:**\n\n-  When a record from the source table matches a preexisting record in the target\ntable, Delta Lake updates the record.\n\n-  When there is no such match, Delta Lake inserts the new record.\n\nThe Delta Lake MERGE command greatly simplifies workflows that can be complex\nand cumbersome with other traditional data formats like Parquet. Common scenarios\nwhere merges/upserts come in handy include change data capture, GDPR/CCPA\ncompliance, sessionization, and deduplication of records.\n\n**For more information about upserts, read:**\n\n[Efficient Upserts Into Data Lakes With Databricks Delta](https://databricks.com/blog/2019/03/19/efficient-upserts-into-data-lakes-databricks-delta.html)\n\n[Simple, Reliable Upserts and Deletes on Delta Lake Tables Using Python APIs](https://databricks.com/blog/2019/10/03/simple-reliable-upserts-and-deletes-on-delta-lake-tables-using-python-apis.html)\n\n[Schema Evolution in Merge Operations and Operational Metrics in Delta Lake](https://databricks.com/blog/2020/05/19/schema-evolution-in-merge-operations-and-operational-metrics-in-delta-lake.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n**MERGE: Under the hood**\nDelta Lake completes a MERGE in two steps:\n\n1. Perform an inner join between the target table and source table to select all files\nthat have matches.\n2. Perform an outer join between the selected files in the target and source tables\nand write out the updated/deleted/inserted data.\n\nThe main way that this differs from an UPDATE or a DELETE under the hood is that\nDelta Lake uses joins to complete a MERGE. This fact allows us to utilize some unique\nstrategies when seeking to improve performance.\n\n**MERGE: Performance tuning tips**\nTo improve performance of the MERGE command, you need to determine which of the\ntwo joins that make up the merge is limiting your speed.\n\nIf the inner join is the bottleneck (i.e., finding the files that Delta Lake needs to rewrite\ntakes too long), try the following strategies:\n\n-  Add more predicates to narrow down the search space.\n\n-  Adjust shuffle partitions.\n\n-  Adjust broadcast join thresholds.\n\n-  Compact the small files in the table if there are lots of them, but don‚Äôt compact them\ninto files that are too large, since Delta Lake has to copy the entire file to rewrite it.\n\n\n**On Databricks‚Äô managed Delta Lake, use Z-Order optimize to exploit the**\n**locality of updates.**\n\nOn the other hand, if the outer join is the bottleneck (i.e., rewriting the actual files\nthemselves takes too long), try the strategies below.\n\n-  **Adjust shuffle partitions:** Reduce files by enabling automatic repartitioning\nbefore writes (with Optimized Writes in Databricks Delta Lake).\n\n-  **\u0007Adjust broadcast thresholds:** If you‚Äôre doing a full outer join, Spark cannot do a\nbroadcast join, but if you‚Äôre doing a right outer join, Spark can do one, and you can\nadjust the broadcast thresholds as needed.\n\n-  **Cache the source table / DataFrame:** Caching the source table can speed up the\nsecond scan, but be sure not to cache the target table, as this can lead to cache\ncoherency issues.\n\nDelta Lake supports DML commands including UPDATE, DELETE and MERGE INTO, which\ngreatly simplify the workflow for many common big data operations. In this chapter, we\ndemonstrated how to use these commands in Delta Lake, shared information about\nhow each one works under the hood, and offered some performance tuning tips.\n\n**Want a deeper dive into DML internals, including snippets of code?**\n\n[Read our blog post >](https://databricks.com/blog/2020/09/29/diving-into-delta-lake-dml-internals-update-delete-merge.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n**How Delta Lake Quickly**\n**Processes Petabytes With**\n**Data Skipping and Z-Ordering**\n\nDelta Lake is capable of sifting through petabytes of data within seconds. Much of this\nspeed is owed to two features: (1) data skipping and (2) Z-Ordering.\n\nCombining these features helps the [Databricks Runtime](https://databricks.com/product/databricks-runtime) to dramatically reduce the\namount of data that needs to be scanned to answer selective queries against large\nDelta tables, which typically translates into substantial runtime improvements and\ncost savings.\n\nUsing Delta Lake‚Äôs built-in data skipping and ZORDER clustering features, large cloud\ndata lakes can be queried in a matter of seconds by skipping files not relevant to\nthe query. For example, 93.2% of the records in a 504 TB data set were skipped for a\ntypical query in a real-world cybersecurity analysis use case, reducing query times by\nup to two orders of magnitude. In other words, Delta Lake can speed up your queries\nby as much as 100x.\n\n**Want to see data skipping and Z-Ordering in action?**\n\nApple‚Äôs Dominique Brezinski and Databricks‚Äô Michael Armbrust demonstrated how to\n\nuse Delta Lake as a unified solution for data engineering and data science in the context\n\nof cybersecurity monitoring and threat response. Watch their keynote speech, Threat\n\n[Detection and Response at Scale.](https://databricks.com/session/keynote-from-apple)\n\n\n-----\n\nAND / OR / NOT are also supported as well as ‚Äúliteral op column‚Äù predicates.\n\nEven though data skipping kicks in when the above conditions are met, it may not\nalways be effective. But, if there are a few columns that you frequently filter by and\nwant to make sure that‚Äôs fast, then you can explicitly optimize your data layout with\nrespect to skipping effectiveness by running the following command:\n\nOPTIMIZE <table> [ WHERE <partition_filter>]\nZORDER BY (<column> [, ‚Ä¶])\n\n**Exploring the details**\nApart from partition pruning, another common technique that‚Äôs used in the data\nwarehousing world, but which Spark currently lacks, is I/O pruning based on [small](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645924.671173)\n[materialized aggregates](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645924.671173) . In short, the idea is to keep track of simple statistics such\nas minimum and maximum values at a certain granularity that are correlated with I/O\ngranularity. And we want to leverage those statistics at query planning time in order\nto avoid unnecessary I/O.\n\nThis is exactly what Delta Lake‚Äôs [data skipping](https://docs.databricks.com/delta/optimizations/file-mgmt.html#data-skipping) feature is about. As new data is\ninserted into a Delta Lake table, file-level min/max statistics are collected for all\ncolumns (including nested ones) of supported types. Then, when there‚Äôs a lookup\nquery against the table, Delta Lake first consults these statistics in order to determine\nwhich files can safely be skipped.\n\n**Want to learn more about data skipping and Z-Ordering, including**\n**how to apply it within a cybersecurity analysis?**\n\n[Read our blog post >](https://databricks.com/blog/2018/07/31/processing-petabytes-of-data-in-seconds-with-databricks-delta.html)\n\n\n**Using data skipping and Z-Order clustering**\nData skipping and Z-Ordering are used to improve the performance of needle-in-thehaystack queries against huge data sets. Data skipping is an automatic feature of\nDelta Lake, kicking in whenever your SQL queries or data set operations include filters\nof the form ‚Äúcolumn op literal,‚Äù where:\n\n-  column is an attribute of some Delta Lake table, be it top-level or nested, whose\ndata type is string / numeric / date/ timestamp\n\n-  op is a binary comparison operator, StartsWith / LIKE pattern%‚Äô, or IN\n<list_of_values>\n\n-  literal is an explicit (list of) value(s) of the same data type as a column\n\n\n-----\n\n**Features**\nUse Delta Lake‚Äôs robust features\nto reliably manage your data\n\n## CHAPTER 02\n\n\n-----\n\n**Why Use MERGE**\n**With Delta Lake?**\n\n[Delta Lake](https://databricks.com/product/delta-lake-on-databricks) , the next-generation engine built on top of Apache Spark, supports the\nMERGE command, which allows you to efficiently upsert and delete records in your\ndata lakes.\n\nMERGE dramatically simplifies how a number of common data pipelines can be built\n-- all the complicated multi-hop processes that inefficiently rewrote entire partitions\ncan now be replaced by simple MERGE queries.\n\nThis finer-grained update capability simplifies how you build your big data\npipelines for various use cases ranging from change data capture to GDPR. You\nno longer need to write complicated logic to overwrite tables and overcome a lack\nof snapshot isolation.\n\nWith changing data, another critical capability required is the ability to roll back, in\ncase of bad writes. Delta Lake also offers [rollback capabilities with the Time Travel](https://databricks.com/blog/2019/02/04/introducing-delta-time-travel-for-large-scale-data-lakes.html)\n[feature](https://databricks.com/blog/2019/02/04/introducing-delta-time-travel-for-large-scale-data-lakes.html) , so that if you do a bad merge, you can easily roll back to an earlier version.\n\nIn this chapter, we‚Äôll discuss common use cases where existing data might need to be\nupdated or deleted. We‚Äôll also explore the challenges inherent to upserts and explain\nhow MERGE can address them.\n\n\n-----\n\n**When are upserts necessary?**\nThere are a number of common use cases where existing data in a data lake needs to\nbe updated or deleted:\n\n-  \u0007 **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance:** With the introduction of\nthe right to be forgotten (also known as data erasure) in GDPR, organizations must\nremove a user‚Äôs information upon request. This data erasure includes deleting user\ninformation in the data lake as well.\n\n-  **Change data capture from traditional databases:** In a service-oriented\narchitecture, typically web and mobile applications are served by microservices\nbuilt on traditional SQL/NoSQL databases that are optimized for low latency. One\nof the biggest challenges organizations face is joining data across these various\nsiloed data systems, and hence data engineers build pipelines to consolidate\nall data sources into a central data lake to facilitate analytics. These pipelines\noften have to periodically read changes made on a traditional SQL/NoSQL table\nand apply them to corresponding tables in the data lake. Such changes can take\nvarious forms: Tables with slowly changing dimensions, change data capture of all\ninserted/updated/deleted rows, etc.\n\n-  \u0007 **Sessionization:** Grouping multiple events into a single session is a common use\ncase in many areas ranging from product analytics to targeted advertising to\npredictive maintenance. Building continuous applications to track sessions and\nrecording the results that write into data lakes is difficult because data lakes have\nalways been optimized for appending data.\n\n-  **\u0007De-duplication:** A common data pipeline use case is to collect system logs into a\nDelta Lake table by appending data to the table. However, often the sources can\ngenerate duplicate records and downstream de-duplication steps are needed to\ntake care of them.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Why upserts into data lakes have**\n**traditionally been challenging**\nSince data lakes are fundamentally based on files, they have always been optimized\nfor appending data rather than for changing existing data. Hence, building the above\nuse case has always been challenging.\n\nUsers typically read the entire table (or a subset of partitions) and then overwrite\nthem. Therefore, every organization tries to reinvent the wheel for their requirement\nby handwriting complicated queries in SQL, Spark, etc. This approach is:\n\n-  **\u0007Inefficient:** Reading and rewriting entire partitions (or entire tables) to update a few\nrecords causes pipelines to be slow and costly. Hand-tuning the table layout and\nquery optimization is tedious and requires deep domain knowledge.\n\n-  **\u0007Possibly incorrect:** Handwritten code modifying data is very prone to logical and\nhuman errors. For example, multiple pipelines concurrently modifying the same table\nwithout any transactional support can lead to unpredictable data inconsistencies\nand in the worst case, data losses. Often, even a single handwritten pipeline can\neasily cause data corruptions due to errors in encoding the business logic.\n\n-  **\u0007Hard to maintain:** Fundamentally such handwritten code is hard to understand,\nkeep track of and maintain. In the long term, this alone can significantly increase\nthe organizational and infrastructural costs.\n\n**Introducing MERGE in Delta Lake**\nWith Delta Lake, you can easily address the use cases above without any of the\naforementioned problems using the following MERGE command:\n\nMERGE INTO\n\nUSING\n\nON\n\n[ WHEN MATCHED [ AND ] THEN ]\n\n\n\n[ WHEN NOT MATCHED [ AND ] THEN ]\n\nwhere\n\n=\n\nDELETE |\n\nUPDATE SET -  |\n\nUPDATE SET column1 = value1 [, column2 = value2 ...]\n\n=\n\nINSERT -  |\n\nINSERT (column1 [, column2 ...]) VALUES (value1 [, value2 ...])\n\nLet‚Äôs understand how to use MERGE with a simple example. Suppose you have a\n[slowly changing dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowly_changing_dimension) table that maintains user information like addresses.\nFurthermore, you have a table of new addresses for both existing and new users. To\nmerge all the new addresses to the main user table, you can run the following:\n\nMERGE INTO users\n\nUSING updates\n\nON users.userId = updates.userId\n\nWHEN MATCHED THEN\n\nUPDATE SET address = updates.addresses\n\nWHEN NOT MATCHED THEN\nINSERT (userId, address) VALUES (updates.userId, updates.address)\n\nThis will perform exactly what the syntax says -- for existing users (i.e., MATCHED\nclause), it will update the address column, and for new users (i.e., NOT MATCHED\nclause) it will insert all the columns. For large tables with TBs of data, this Delta Lake\nMERGE operation can be orders of magnitude faster than overwriting entire partitions\nor tables since Delta Lake reads only relevant files and updates them. Specifically,\nDelta Lake's MERGE has the following advantages:\n\n\n\n[ WHEN MATCHED [ AND ] THEN ]\n\n\n-----\n\n**Simplifying use cases with MERGE**\n**Deleting data due to GDPR**\nComplying with the ‚Äúright to be forgotten‚Äù clause of GDPR for data in data lakes cannot\nget any easier. You can set up a simple scheduled job with an example code, like\nbelow, to delete all the users who have opted out of your service.\n\nMERGE INTO users\n\nUSING opted_out_users\n\nON opted_out_users.userId = users.userId\n\nWHEN MATCHED THEN DELETE\n\n**Applying change data from databases**\nYou can easily apply all data changes ‚Äî updates, deletes, inserts ‚Äî generated from an\nexternal database into a Delta Lake table with the MERGE syntax as follows:\n\nMERGE INTO users\n\nUSING (\n\nSELECT userId, latest.address AS address, latest.deleted AS deleted FROM\n\n(\n\nSELECT userId, MAX(struct(TIME, address, deleted)) AS latest\n\nFROM changes GROUP BY userId\n\n)\n\n) latestChange\n\nON latestChange.userId = users.userId\n\nWHEN MATCHED AND latestChange.deleted = TRUE THEN\n\nDELETE\n\nWHEN MATCHED THEN\n\nUPDATE SET address = latestChange.address\n\nWHEN NOT MATCHED AND latestChange.deleted = FALSE THEN\n\nINSERT (userId, address) VALUES (userId, address)\n\n\n\n-  **\u0007Fine-grained:** The operation rewrites data at the granularity of files and not\npartitions. This eliminates all the complications of rewriting partitions, updating\nthe Hive metastore with MSCK and so on.\n\n-  **\u0007Efficient:** Delta Lake‚Äôs data skipping makes the MERGE efficient at finding files to\nrewrite, thus eliminating the need to hand-optimize your pipeline. Furthermore,\nDelta Lake with all its I/O and processing optimizations makes all the reading and\nwriting data by MERGE significantly faster than similar operations in Apache Spark.\n\n-  **\u0007Transactional:** Delta Lake uses optimistic concurrency control to ensure that\nconcurrent writers update the data correctly with ACID transactions, and concurrent\nreaders always see a consistent snapshot of the data.\n\nHere is a visual explanation of how MERGE compares with handwritten pipelines.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Updating session information from streaming**\n**pipelines**\nIf you have streaming event data flowing in and if you want to sessionize the streaming\nevent data and incrementally update and store sessions in a Delta Lake table, you\ncan accomplish this using the foreachBatch in Structured Streaming and MERGE.\nFor example, suppose you have a Structured Streaming DataFrame that computes\nupdated session information for each user. You can start a streaming query that\napplies all the sessions update to a Delta Lake table as follows (Scala).\n\nstreamingSessionUpdatesDF.writeStream\n\n.foreachBatch { (microBatchOutputDF: DataFrame , batchId: Long ) =>\n\nmicroBatchOutputDF.createOrReplaceTempView(‚Äúupdates‚Äù)\n\nmicroBatchOutputDF.sparkSession.sql(s‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù\n\nMERGE INTO sessions\n\nUSING updates\n\nON sessions.sessionId = updates.sessionId\n\nWHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET *\n\nWHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT * ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù )\n\n}.start()\n\nFor a complete working example of each Batch and MERGE, see this notebook\n( [Azure](https://docs.azuredatabricks.net/_static/notebooks/merge-in-streaming.html) | [AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/_static/notebooks/merge-in-streaming.html) ).\n\n**Additional resources**\n\n[Tech Talk | Addressing GDPR and CCPA Scenarios With Delta Lake and Apache Spark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCPslvUjG1w)\n\n[Tech Talk | Using Delta as a Change Data Capture Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y0AAQ6qX5w)\n\n[Simplifying Change Data Capture With Databricks Delta](https://databricks.com/blog/2018/10/29/simplifying-change-data-capture-with-databricks-delta.html)\n\n[Building Sessionization Pipeline at Scale With Databricks Delta](https://databricks.com/session/building-sessionization-pipeline-at-scale-with-databricks-delta)\n\n[Tech Chat | Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) Type 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZWwZG07hzQ)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Simple, Reliable Upserts and**\n**Deletes on Delta Lake Tables**\n**Using Python APIs**\n\nIn this chapter, we will demonstrate how to use Python and the new Python APIs in Delta\nLake within the context of an on-time flight performance scenario. We will show how\nto upsert and delete data, query old versions of data with time travel, and vacuum\nolder versions for cleanup.\n\n**How to start using Delta Lake**\nThe Delta Lake package is installable through PySpark by using the --packages\noption. In our example, we will also demonstrate the ability to VACUUM files and execute\nDelta Lake SQL commands within Apache Spark. As this is a short demonstration, we\nwill also enable the following configurations:\n\n\u0007spark.databricks.delta.retentionDurationCheck.enabled=false\n\nto allow us to vacuum files shorter than the default retention duration of seven days.\nNote, this is only required for the SQL command VACUUM\n\n\u0007spark.sql.extensions=io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension\n\nto enable Delta Lake SQL commands within Apache Spark; this is not required for\nPython or Scala API calls.\n\n# Using Spark Packages\n\n./bin/pyspark --packages io.delta:delta-core_2.11:0.4.0 --conf ‚Äúspark.\n\ndatabricks.delta.retentionDurationCheck.enabled=false‚Äù --conf ‚Äúspark.\n\nsql.extensions=io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension‚Äù\n\n\n-----\n\n**Loading and saving our Delta Lake data**\nThis scenario will be using the On-Time Flight Performance or Departure Delays data\nset generated from the RITA BTS Flight Departure Statistics; some examples of this data\nin action include the and OnTime Flight Performance with GraphFrames for Apache Spark‚Ñ¢. Within PySpark, start [2014 Flight Departure Performance via d3.js Crossfilter](https://dennyglee.com/2014/06/06/2014-flight-departure-performance-via-d3-js-crossfilter/)\nby reading the data set.\n\n\u0007# Location variables\n\n\n/departureDelays.delta$ ls l\n\n.\n\n..\n\n_delta_log\n\npart- 00000 -df6f69ea-e6aa- 424b -bc0e-f3674c4f1906-c000.snappy.parquet\n\npart- 00001 -711bcce3-fe9e- 466e -a22c- 8256f8b54930 -c000.snappy.parquet\n\npart- 00002 -  778ba97d -  89b8 -  4942 -a495- 5f6238830b68 -c000.snappy.parquet\n\nPart- 00003 -  1a791c4a-6f11-49a8 -8837-8 093a3220581 -c000.snappy.parquet\n\n\ntripdelaysFilePath = ‚Äú/root/data/departuredelays.csv‚Äù\n\npathToEventsTable = ‚Äú/root/deltalake/departureDelays.delta‚Äù\n\nNow, let‚Äôs reload the data, but this time our DataFrame will be backed by Delta Lake.\n\n# Read flight delay data\n\n\ndepartureDelays = spark.read \\\n\n.option( ‚Äúheader‚Äù , ‚Äútrue‚Äù ) \\\n\n.option( ‚ÄúinferSchema‚Äù , ‚Äútrue‚Äù ) \\\n\n.csv(tripdelaysFilePath)\n\nNext, let‚Äôs save our departureDelays data set to a Delta Lake table. By saving this table\nto Delta Lake storage, we will be able to take advantage of its features including ACID\ntransactions, unified batch and streaming and time travel.\n\n# Save flight delay data into Delta Lake format\n\ndepartureDelays \\\n\n.write \\\n\n\n# Load flight delay data in Delta Lake format\n\ndelays_delta = spark \\\n\n.read \\\n\n.format( ‚Äúdelta‚Äù ) \\\n\n.load( ‚ÄúdepartureDelays.delta‚Äù )\n\n# Create temporary view\n\ndelays_delta.createOrReplaceTempView(‚Äúdelays_delta‚Äù)\n\n# How many flights are between Seattle and San Francisco\n\nspark.sql(‚Äúselect count(1) from delays_delta where origin = ‚ÄòSEA‚Äô and\n\ndestination = ‚ÄòSFO‚Äô‚Äù).show()\n\n\n.format( ‚Äúdelta‚Äù ) \\\n\n.mode( ‚Äúoverwrite‚Äù ) \\\n\n.save( ‚ÄúdepartureDelays.delta‚Äù )\n\nNote, this approach is similar to how you would normally save Parquet data; instead\nof specifying format(‚Äúparquet‚Äù) , you will now specify format(‚Äúdelta‚Äù) . If\nyou were to take a look at the underlying file system, you will notice four files created\nfor the departureDelays Delta Lake table.\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally, lets determine the number of flights originating from Seattle to San Francisco; in\nthis data set, there are 1698 flights.\n\n**In-place conversion to Delta Lake**\nIf you have existing Parquet tables, you have the ability to convert them to Delta Lake\nformat in place, thus not needing to rewrite your table. To convert the table, you can\nrun the following commands.\n\n\ndeltaTable DeltaTable .forPath(spark, pathToEventsTable\n\n)\n\n# Delete all on-time and early flights\n\ndeltaTable. delete ( ‚Äúdelay < 0‚Äù )\n\n# How many flights are between Seattle and San Francisco\n\nspark.sql( ‚Äúselect count(1) from delays_delta where origin = ‚ÄòSEA‚Äô and\n\ndestination = ‚ÄòSFO‚Äô‚Äù ).show()\n\n\nfrom delta.tables import - \n\n# Convert non partitioned parquet table at path ‚Äò/path/to/table‚Äô\n\ndeltaTable = DeltaTable .convertToDelta(spark, ‚Äúparquet.`/path/to/\n\ntable`‚Äù )\n\n# Convert partitioned parquet table at path ‚Äò/path/to/table‚Äô and\n\npartitioned by integer column named ‚Äòpart‚Äô\n\n\nAfter we delete (more on this below) all of the on-time and early flights, as you can\nsee from the preceding query there are 837 late flights originating from Seattle to\nSan Francisco. If you review the file system, you will notice there are more files even\nthough you deleted data.\n\n/departureDelays.delta$ ls -l\n\n_delta_log\n\npart- 00000 -a2a19ba4- 17e 9- 4931 -  9bbf -  3c9d4997780 b-c000.snappy.parquet\n\npart-00000-df6f69ea-e6aa-424b-bc0e-f3674c4f1906-c000.snappy.parquet\n\npart- 00001 -  711bcce3 -fe9e- 466e -a22c- 8256f8b54930 -c000.snappy.parquet\n\npart- 00001 -a0423a18- 62eb -  46b3 -a82f-ca9aac1f1e93-c000.snappy.parquet\n\npart- 00002 -  778ba97d -  89b8 -  4942 -a495-5f6238830b68-c000.snappy.parquet\n\npart- 00002 -bfaa0a2a- 0a31 -  4abf -aa63- 162402f802cc -c000.snappy.parquet\n\npart- 00003 -  1a791c4a -  6f11 -  49a8 -8837- 8093a3220581 -c000.snappy.parquet\n\npart- 00003 -b0247e1d-f5ce- 4b45 -  91cd -  16413c784a66 -c000.snappy.parquet\n\n\npartitionedDeltaTable = DeltaTable .convertToDelta(spark,\n\n‚Äúparquet.`/path/to/table`‚Äù, ‚Äúpart int‚Äù )\n\n**Delete our flight data**\nTo delete data from a traditional data lake table, you will need to:\n\n1. Select all of the data from your table not including the rows you want to delete\n2. Create a new table based on the previous query\n3. Delete the original table\n4. Rename the new table to the original table name for downstream dependencies\n\nInstead of performing all of these steps, with Delta Lake, we can simplify this process\nby running a DELETE statement. To show this, let‚Äôs delete all of the flights that had\narrived early or on-time (i.e., delay < 0).\n\n\nfrom delta.tables import - \n\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import - \n\n# Access the Delta Lake table\n\n\n-----\n\nIn traditional data lakes, deletes are performed by rewriting the entire table\nexcluding the values to be deleted. With Delta Lake, deletes are instead performed\nby selectively writing new versions of the files containing the data to be deleted and\nonly marks the previous files as deleted. This is because Delta Lake uses multiversion\nconcurrency control (MVCC) to do atomic operations on the table: For example, while\none user is deleting data, another user may be querying the previous version of the\ntable. This multiversion model also enables us to travel back in time (i.e., [time travel](https://databricks.com/blog/2019/02/04/introducing-delta-time-travel-for-large-scale-data-lakes.html) )\nand query previous versions as we will see later.\n\n**Update our flight data**\nTo update data from your traditional Data Lake table, you will need to:\n\n1. Select all of the data from your table not including the rows you want to modify\n2. Modify the rows that need to be updated/changed\n3. Merge these two tables to create a new table\n4. Delete the original table\n5. Rename the new table to the original table name for downstream dependencies\n\nInstead of performing all of these steps, with Delta Lake, we can simplify this\nprocess by running an UPDATE statement. To show this, let‚Äôs update all of the flights\noriginating from Detroit to Seattle.\n\n\nWith the Detroit flights now tagged as Seattle flights, we now have 986 flights\noriginating from Seattle to San Francisco. If you were to list the file system for\nyour departureDelays folder (i.e., $../departureDelays/ls -l ), you will\nnotice there are now 11 files (instead of the 8 right after deleting the files and the four\nfiles after creating the table).\n\n**Merge our flight data**\nA common scenario when working with a data lake is to continuously append data to\nyour table. This often results in duplicate data (rows you do not want to be inserted\ninto your table again), new rows that need to be inserted, and some rows that need to\nbe updated. With Delta Lake, all of this can be achieved by using the merge operation\n(similar to the SQL MERGE statement).\n\nLet‚Äôs start with a sample data set that you will want to be updated, inserted or\nde-duplicated with the following query.\n\n\n# Update all flights originating from Detroit to now be\n\n\noriginating from Seattle\n\ndeltaTable.update(‚Äúorigin = ‚ÄòDTW‚Äô‚Äù, { ‚Äúorigin‚Äù: ‚Äú‚ÄôSEA‚Äô‚Äù } )\n\n\n# What flights between SEA and SFO for these date periods\n\nspark.sql( ‚Äúselect * from delays_delta where origin = ‚ÄòSEA‚Äô and\n\ndestination = ‚ÄòSFO‚Äô and date like ‚Äò1010%‚Äô limit 10‚Äù ).show()\n\n\n# How many flights are between Seattle and San Francisco\n\n\nThe output of this query looks like the following table. Note, the color-coding has been\nadded to clearly identify which rows are de-duplicated (blue), updated (yellow) and\ninserted (green).\n\n\nspark.sql( ‚Äúselect count(1) from delays_delta where origin = ‚ÄòSEA‚Äô\n\nand destination = ‚ÄòSFO‚Äô‚Äù ).show()\n\n\n-----\n\nNext, let‚Äôs generate our own merge_table that contains data we will insert, update\nor de-duplicate with the following code snippet.\n\nitems = [( 1010710 , 31 , 590 , ‚ÄòSEA‚Äô, ‚ÄòSFO‚Äô), ( 1010521 , 10 , 590 ,\n\n‚ÄòSEA‚Äô , ‚ÄòSFO‚Äô ),\n\n(1010822, 31, 590, ‚ÄòSEA‚Äô, ‚ÄòSFO‚Äô)]\n\n\nWith Delta Lake, this can be easily achieved via a merge statement as noted in the\nfollowing code snippet.\n\n# Merge merge_table with flights\n\ndeltaTable. alias( ‚Äúflights‚Äù ) \\\n\n.merge(merge_table. alias ( ‚Äúupdates‚Äù),‚Äùflights.date =\n\nupdates.date‚Äù ) \\\n\n.whenMatchedUpdate(set = { ‚Äúdelay‚Äù : ‚Äúupdates.delay‚Äù } ) \\\n\n.whenNotMatchedInsertAll() \\\n\n.execute()\n\n# What flights between SEA and SFO for these date periods\n\nspark.sql( ‚Äúselect * from delays_delta where origin = ‚ÄòSEA‚Äô and\n\ndestination = ‚ÄòSFO‚Äô and date like ‚Äò1010%‚Äô limit 10‚Äù ).show()\n\n\ncols = [ ‚Äòdate‚Äô , ‚Äòdelay‚Äô , ‚Äòdistance‚Äô , ‚Äòorigin‚Äô , ‚Äòdestination‚Äô ]\n\n\nmerge_table = spark.createDataFrame(items, cols)\n\nmerge_table.toPandas()\n\nIn the preceding table ( merge_table ), there are three rows with a unique date value:\n\n1. 1010521: This row needs to _update_ the _flights_ table with a new delay value (yellow)\n2. 1010710: This row is a _duplicate_ (blue)\n3. 1010832: This is a new row to be _inserted_ (green)\n\n\nAll three actions of de-duplication, update and insert were efficiently completed with\none statement.\n\n**View table history**\nAs previously noted, after each of our transactions (delete, update), there were more\nfiles created within the file system. This is because for each transaction, there are\ndifferent versions of the Delta Lake table.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis can be seen by using the DeltaTable.history() method as noted below\n\nNote: You can also perform the same task with SQL:\n\nspark.sql(‚ÄúDESCRIBE HISTORY ‚Äò‚Äù + pathToEventsTable + ‚Äú‚Äô‚Äù).show()\n\nAs you can see, there are three rows representing the different versions of the table\n(below is an abridged version to help make it easier to read) for each of the operations\n(create table, delete and update):\n\n**Travel back in time with table history**\nWith Time Travel, you can review the Delta Lake table as of the version or timestamp.\nTo view historical data, specify the version or timestamp option; in the following code\nsnippet, we will specify the version option.\n\n\n# Load DataFrames for each version\n\ndfv0 = spark.read.format( ‚Äúdelta‚Äù ).option( ‚ÄúversionAsOf‚Äù ,\n\n0 ).load( ‚ÄúdepartureDelays.delta‚Äù )\n\ndfv1 = spark.read.format(‚Äúdelta‚Äù).option( ‚ÄúversionAsOf‚Äù ,\n\n1 ).load( ‚ÄúdepartureDelays.delta‚Äù )\n\ndfv2 = spark.read.format( ‚Äúdelta‚Äù ).option( ‚ÄúversionAsOf‚Äù ,\n\n2 ).load( ‚ÄúdepartureDelays.delta‚Äù )\n\n# Calculate the SEA to SFO flight counts for each version of history\n\ncnt0 = dfv0. where( ‚Äúorigin = ‚ÄòSEA‚Äô‚Äù). where ( ‚Äúdestination = ‚ÄòSFO‚Äô‚Äù ).count()\n\ncnt1 = dfv1. where (‚Äúorigin = ‚ÄòSEA‚Äô‚Äù). where ( ‚Äúdestination = ‚ÄòSFO‚Äô‚Äù ).count()\n\ncnt2 = dfv2. where (‚Äúorigin = ‚ÄòSEA‚Äô‚Äù). where ( ‚Äúdestination = ‚ÄòSFO‚Äô‚Äù ).count()\n\n# Print out the value\n\nprint ( ‚ÄúSEA -> SFO Counts: Create Table: %s, Delete: %s, Update: %s‚Äù %\n\n(cnt0, cnt1, cnt2))\n\n## Output\n\nSEA -> SFO Counts : Create Table: 1698 , Delete: 837, Update: 986\n\nWhether for governance, risk management and compliance (GRC) or rolling back\nerrors, the Delta Lake table contains both the metadata (e.g., recording the fact that a\ndelete had occurred with these operators) and data (e.g., the actual rows deleted).

[Delta Lake](https://delta.io/) is an [open-source storage](https://github.com/delta-io/delta)\n[layer](https://github.com/delta-io/delta) that brings reliability to data lakes. Delta Lake provides ACID transactions, scalable\nmetadata handling, and unifies streaming and batch data processing. Delta Lake runs on\ntop of your existing data lake and is fully compatible with Apache Spark APIs.\n\nWith this feature, Delta Lake automatically versions the big data that you store in your\ndata lake, and you can access any historical version of that data. This temporal data\nmanagement simplifies your data pipeline by making it easy to audit, roll back data\nin case of accidental bad writes or deletes, and reproduce experiments and reports.\n\nYour organization can finally standardize on a clean, centralized, versioned big data\nrepository in your own cloud storage for your analytics.\n\n**Common challenges with changing data**\n\n-  **Audit data changes:** Auditing data changes is critical both in terms of data\ncompliance as well as simple debugging to understand how data has changed over\ntime. Organizations moving from traditional data systems to big data technologies\nand the cloud struggle in such scenarios.\n\n-  **Reproduce experiments and reports:** During model training, data scientists\nrun various experiments with different parameters on a given set of data. When\nscientists revisit their experiments after a period of time to reproduce the models,\ntypically the source data has been modified by upstream pipelines. A lot of times,\nthey are caught unaware by such upstream data changes and hence struggle to\nreproduce their experiments. Some scientists and organizations engineer best\n\n\n-----\n\npractices by creating multiple copies of the data, leading to increased storage\ncosts. The same is true for analysts generating reports.\n\n-  **Rollbacks:** Data pipelines can sometimes write bad data for downstream consumers.\n\nThis can happen because of issues ranging from infrastructure instabilities to messy\ndata to bugs in the pipeline. For pipelines that do simple appends to directories or a\ntable, rollbacks can easily be addressed by date-based partitioning. With updates\nand deletes, this can become very complicated, and data engineers typically have\nto engineer a complex pipeline to deal with such scenarios.\n\n**Working with Time Travel**\nDelta Lake‚Äôs time travel capabilities simplify building data pipelines for the above use\ncases. Time Travel in Delta Lake improves developer productivity tremendously. It helps:\n\n-  Data scientists manage their experiments better\n\n-  Data engineers simplify their pipelines and roll back bad writes\n\n-  Data analysts do easy reporting\n\nOrganizations can finally standardize on a clean, centralized, versioned big data\nrepository in their own cloud storage for analytics. We are thrilled to see what you will\nbe able to accomplish with this feature.\n\nAs you write into a Delta Lake table or directory, every operation is automatically\nversioned. You can access the different versions of the data two different ways:\n\n**1. Using a timestamp**\n**Scala syntax**\nYou can provide the timestamp or date string as an option to DataFrame reader:\n\nval df = spark.read\n\n.format( ‚Äúdelta‚Äù )\n\n.option( ‚ÄútimestampAsOf‚Äù , ‚Äú2019-01-01‚Äù )\n\n.load( ‚Äú/path/to/my/table‚Äù )\n\n\n-----\n\n**Python syntax**\n\ndf = spark.read \\\n\n.format( ‚Äúdelta‚Äù ) \\\n\n.option( ‚ÄútimestampAsOf‚Äù , ‚Äú2019-01-01‚Äù ) \\\n\n.load( ‚Äú/path/to/my/table‚Äù )\n\n**SQL syntax**\n\nSELECT count(*) FROM my_table TIMESTAMP AS OF ‚Äú2019-01-01‚Äù\n\nSELECT count(*) FROM my_table TIMESTAMP AS OF date_sub(current_date(), 1 )\n\nSELECT count(*) FROM my_table TIMESTAMP AS OF ‚Äú2019-01-01 01:30:00.000‚Äù\n\nIf the reader code is in a library that you don‚Äôt have access to, and if you are passing\ninput parameters to the library to read data, you can still travel back in time for a table\nby passing the timestamp in yyyyMMddHHmmssSSS format to the path:\n\nval inputPath = ‚Äú/path/to/my/table@20190101000000000‚Äù\n\nval df = loadData(inputPath)\n\n// Function in a library that you don‚Äôt have access to\n\ndef loadData(inputPath : String ) : DataFrame = {\n\nspark.read\n\n.format(‚Äúdelta‚Äù)\n\n.load(inputPath)\n\n}\n\ninputPath = ‚Äú/path/to/my/table@20190101000000000‚Äù\n\ndf = loadData(inputPath)\n\n# Function in a library that you don‚Äôt have access to\n\ndef loadData(inputPath):\n\nreturn spark.read \\\n\n.format( ‚Äúdelta‚Äù ) \\\n\n.load(inputPath)\n\n\n-----\n\n**2. Using a version number**\nIn Delta Lake, every write has a version number, and you can use the version number\nto travel back in time as well.\n\n**Scala syntax**\n\nval df = spark.read\n\n.format( ‚Äúdelta‚Äù )\n\n.option( ‚ÄúversionAsOf‚Äù , ‚Äú5238‚Äù )\n\n.load( ‚Äú/path/to/my/table‚Äù )\n\nval df = spark.read\n\n.format( ‚Äúdelta‚Äù )\n\n.load( ‚Äú/path/to/my/table@v5238‚Äù )\n\n**Python syntax**\n\ndf = spark.read \\\n\n.format( ‚Äúdelta‚Äù ) \\\n\n.option( ‚ÄúversionAsOf‚Äù , ‚Äú5238‚Äù ) \\\n\n.load( ‚Äú/path/to/my/table‚Äù )\n\ndf = spark.read \\\n\n.format( ‚Äúdelta‚Äù ) \\\n\n.load( ‚Äú/path/to/my/table@v5238‚Äù )\n\n**SQL syntax**\n\nSELECT count(*) FROM my_table VERSION AS OF 5238\n\n\n-----\n\n**Audit data changes**\nYou can look at the history of table changes using the DESCRIBE HISTORY command\nor through the UI.\n\n**Reproduce experiments and reports**\nTime travel also plays an important role in machine learning and data science.\nReproducibility of models and experiments is a key consideration for data scientists\nbecause they often create hundreds of models before they put one into production,\nand in that time-consuming process would like to go back to earlier models. However,\nbecause data management is often separate from data science tools, this is really\nhard to accomplish.\n\nDatabricks solves this reproducibility problem by integrating Delta Lake‚Äôs Time\nTravel capabilities with [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) , an open-source platform for the machine learning\nlifecycle. For reproducible machine learning training, you can simply log a\n\n\ntimestamped URL to the path as an MLflow parameter to track which version of the\ndata was used for each training job.\n\nThis enables you to go back to earlier settings and data sets to reproduce earlier\nmodels. You neither need to coordinate with upstream teams on the data nor worry\nabout cloning data for different experiments. This is the power of unified analytics,\nwhereby data science is closely married with data engineering.\n\n**Rollbacks**\nTime travel also makes it easy to do rollbacks in case of bad writes. For example, if\nyour GDPR pipeline job had a bug that accidentally deleted user information, you can\neasily fix the pipeline:\n\nINSERT INTO my_table\n\nSELECT -  FROM my_table TIMESTAMP AS OF date_sub(current_date(), 1 )\n\nWHERE userId = 111\n\n\n-----\n\nYou can also fix incorrect updates as follows:\n\n# Will use the latest version of the table for all operations below\n\nMERGE INTO my_table target\n\n\nUSING my_table TIMESTAMP AS OF date_sub(current_date(), 1 ) source\n\nON source.userId = target.userId\n\nWHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET - \n\nIf you simply want to roll back to a previous version of your table, you can do so with\neither of the following commands:\n\nRESTORE TABLE my_table VERSION AS OF [version_number]\n\nRESTORE TABLE my_table TIMESTAMP AS OF [timestamp]\n\n**Pinned view of a continuously updating**\n**Delta Lake table across multiple downstream jobs**\nWith AS OF queries, you can now pin the snapshot of a continuously updating Delta\nLake table for multiple downstream jobs. Consider a situation where a Delta Lake table\nis being continuously updated, say every 15 seconds, and there is a downstream job\nthat periodically reads from this Delta Lake table and updates different destinations.\nIn such scenarios, typically you want a consistent view of the source Delta Lake table\nso that all destination tables reflect the same state.\n\nYou can now easily handle such scenarios as follows:\n\nversion = spark.sql( ‚ÄúSELECT max(version) FROM (DESCRIBE HISTORY\n\nmy_table)‚Äù ).collect()\n\n\ndata = spark.table( ‚Äúmy_table@v%s‚Äù % version[ 0 ][ 0 ]data.where\n\n( ‚Äúevent_type = e1‚Äù ).write.jdbc( ‚Äútable1‚Äù )\n\ndata.where( ‚Äúevent_type = e2‚Äù ).write.jdbc( ‚Äútable2‚Äù )\n\n...\n\ndata.where( ‚Äúevent_type = e10‚Äù ).write.jdbc( ‚Äútable10‚Äù )\n\n**Queries for time series analytics made simple**\nTime travel also simplifies time series analytics. For example, if you want to find out\nhow many new customers you added over the last week, your query could be a very\nsimple one like this:\n\nSELECT count( distinct userId) - (\n\nSELECT count( distinct userId)\n\nFROM my_table TIMESTAMP AS OF date_sub( current_date (), 7))\n\nFROM my_table\n\n**Additional resources**\n\n[Tech Talk | Diving Into Delta Lake: Unpacking the Transaction Log](https://databricks.com/discover/diving-into-delta-lake-talks/unpacking-transaction-log)\n\n[Tech Talk | Getting Data Ready for Data Science With Delta Lake and MLflow](https://databricks.com/discover/getting-started-with-delta-lake-tech-talks/getting-data-ready-data-science-delta-lake-mlflow)\n\n[Data + AI Summit Europe 2020 | Data Time Travel by Delta Time Machine](https://databricks.com/session_eu20/data-time-travel-by-delta-time-machine-2)\n\n[Spark + AI Summit NA 2020 | Machine Learning Data Lineage With](https://databricks.com/session_na20/machine-learning-data-lineage-with-mlflow-and-delta-lake)\n\n[MLflow and Delta Lake](https://databricks.com/session_na20/machine-learning-data-lineage-with-mlflow-and-delta-lake)\n\n[Productionizing Machine Learning With Delta Lake](https://databricks.com/blog/2019/08/14/productionizing-machine-learning-with-delta-lake.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Easily Clone Your Delta Lake**\n**for Testing, Sharing and ML**\n**Reproducibility**\n\nDelta Lake has a feature called **Table Cloning** , which makes it easy to test, share and\nrecreate tables for ML reproducibility. Creating copies of tables in a data lake or data\nwarehouse has several practical uses. However, given the volume of data in tables\nin a data lake and the rate of its growth, making physical copies of tables is an\nexpensive operation.\n\nDelta Lake now makes the process simpler and cost-effective with the help of\ntable clones.\n\n**What are clones?**\nClones are replicas of a source table at a given point in time. They have the same\nmetadata as the source table: same schema, constraints, column descriptions, statistics\nand partitioning. However, they behave as a separate table with a separate lineage\nor history. Any changes made to clones only affect the clone and not the source. Any\nchanges that happen to the source during or after the cloning process also do not get\nreflected in the clone due to Snapshot Isolation. In Delta Lake we have two types of\nclones: shallow or deep.\n\n**Shallow clones**\nA _shallow_ (also known as a Zero-Copy) clone only duplicates the metadata of the\ntable being cloned; the data files of the table itself are not copied. This type of cloning\ndoes not create another physical copy of the data resulting in minimal storage costs.\nShallow clones are inexpensive and can be extremely fast to create.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese clones are not self-contained and depend on the source from which they were\ncloned as the source of data. If the files in the source that the clone depends on are removed,\nfor example with VACUUM, a shallow clone may become unusable. Therefore, shallow\nclones are typically used for short-lived use cases such as testing and experimentation.\n\n**Deep clones**\nShallow clones are great for short-lived use cases, but some scenarios require a\nseparate and independent copy of the table‚Äôs data. A deep clone makes a full copy of\nthe metadata and the data files of the table being cloned. In that sense, it is similar in\nfunctionality to copying with a CTAS command ( CREATE TABLE.. AS‚Ä¶ SELECT‚Ä¶ ).\nBut it is simpler to specify since it makes a faithful copy of the original table at the\nspecified version, and you don‚Äôt need to re-specify partitioning, constraints and other\ninformation as you have to do with CTAS. In addition, it is much faster, robust and can\nwork in an incremental manner against failures.\n\nWith deep clones, we copy additional metadata, such as your streaming application\ntransactions and COPY INTO transactions, so you can continue your ETL applications\nexactly where it left off on a deep clone.\n\n**Where do clones help?**\nSometimes I wish I had a clone to help with my chores or magic tricks. However, we‚Äôre\nnot talking about human clones here. There are many scenarios where you need a\ncopy of your data sets ‚Äî for exploring, sharing or testing ML models or analytical\nqueries. Below are some examples of customer use cases.\n\n**Testing and experimentation with a production table**\nWhen users need to test a new version of their data pipeline they often have to rely\non sample test data sets that are not representative of all the data in their production\nenvironment. Data teams may also want to experiment with various indexing techniques\nto improve the performance of queries against massive tables. These experiments and\n\n\ntests cannot be carried out in a production environment without risking production\ndata processes and affecting users.\n\nIt can take many hours or even days, to spin up copies of your production tables for a test\nor a development environment. Add to that, the extra storage costs for your development\nenvironment to hold all the duplicated data ‚Äî there is a large overhead in setting a test\nenvironment reflective of the production data. With a shallow clone, this is trivial:\n\n-- SQL\n\nCREATE TABLE delta.`/some/test/location` SHALLOW CLONE prod.events\n\n# Python\n\nDeltaTable.forName(‚Äúspark‚Äù, ‚Äúprod.events‚Äù).clone(‚Äú/some/test/location‚Äù,\n\nisShallow=True)\n\n// Scala\n\nDeltaTable.forName(‚Äúspark‚Äù, ‚Äúprod.events‚Äù).clone(‚Äú/some/test/location‚Äù,\n\nisShallow=true)\n\nAfter creating a shallow clone of your table in a matter of seconds, you can start\nrunning a copy of your pipeline to test out your new code, or try optimizing your table\nin different dimensions to see how you can improve your query performance, and much\nmuch more. These changes will only affect your shallow clone, not your original table.\n\n**Staging major changes to a production table**\nSometimes, you may need to perform some major changes to your production table.\nThese changes may consist of many steps, and you don‚Äôt want other users to see the\nchanges that you‚Äôre making until you‚Äôre done with all of your work. A shallow clone can\nhelp you out here:\n\n\n-----\n\n-- SQL\n\nCREATE TABLE temp.staged_changes SHALLOW CLONE prod.events;\n\nDELETE FROM temp.staged_changes WHERE event_id is null;\n\nUPDATE temp.staged_changes SET change_date = current_date()\n\nWHERE change_date is null;\n\n...\n\n-- Perform your verifications\n\nOnce you‚Äôre happy with the results, you have two options. If no other change has\nbeen made to your source table, you can replace your source table with the clone.\nIf changes have been made to your source table, you can merge the changes into\nyour source table.\n\n-- If no changes have been made to the source\n\nREPLACE TABLE prod.events CLONE temp.staged_changes;\n\n-- If the source table has changed\n\nMERGE INTO prod.events USING temp.staged_changes\n\nON events.event_id <=> staged_changes.event_id\n\nWHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET *;\n\n-- Drop the staged table\n\nDROP TABLE temp.staged_changes;\n\n**Machine learning result reproducibility**\nComing up with an effective ML model is an iterative process. Throughout this process\nof tweaking the different parts of the model, data scientists need to assess the\naccuracy of the model against a fixed data set.\n\nThis is hard to do in a system where the data is constantly being loaded or updated. A\nsnapshot of the data used to train and test the model is required. This snapshot allows\nthe results of the ML model to be reproducible for testing or model governance purposes.\n\n\n-----\n\nWe recommend leveraging [Time Travel](https://databricks.com/blog/2019/02/04/introducing-delta-time-travel-for-large-scale-data-lakes.html) to run multiple experiments across a snapshot; an\nexample of this in action can be seen in [Machine Learning Data Lineage With MLflow](https://databricks.com/session_na20/machine-learning-data-lineage-with-mlflow-and-delta-lake)\n[and Delta Lake.](https://databricks.com/session_na20/machine-learning-data-lineage-with-mlflow-and-delta-lake)\n\nOnce you‚Äôre happy with the results and would like to archive the data for later retrieval,\nfor example, next Black Friday, you can use deep clones to simplify the archiving process.\nMLflow integrates really well with Delta Lake, and the autologging feature (mlflow.spark.\nautolog() ) will tell you which version of the table was used to run a set of experiments.\n\n# Run your ML workloads using Python and then\n\nDeltaTable.forName(spark, ‚Äúfeature_store‚Äù).cloneAtVersion(128, ‚Äúfeature_\n\nstore_bf2020‚Äù)\n\n**Data migration**\nA massive table may need to be moved to a new, dedicated bucket or storage system\nfor performance or governance reasons. The original table will not receive new\nupdates going forward and will be deactivated and removed at a future point in time.\nDeep clones make the copying of massive tables more robust and scalable.\n\n-- SQL\n\nCREATE TABLE delta.`zz://my-new-bucket/events` CLONE prod.events;\n\nALTER TABLE prod.events SET LOCATION ‚Äòzz://my-new-bucket/events‚Äô;\n\nWith deep clones, since we copy your streaming application transactions and\nCOPY INTO transactions, you can continue your ETL applications from exactly where\nit left off after this migration!\n\n**Data sharing**\nIn an organization, it is often the case that users from different departments are\nlooking for data sets that they can use to enrich their analysis or models. You may\nwant to share your data with other users across the organization. But rather than\nsetting up elaborate pipelines to move the data to yet another store, it is often easier\nand economical to create a copy of the relevant data set for users to explore and\n\n\n-----\n\n**Looks awesome! Any gotchas?**\nJust to reiterate some of the gotchas mentioned above as a single list, here‚Äôs what you\nshould be wary of:\n\n-  \u0007 \u0007Clones are executed on a snapshot of your data. Any changes that are made to\nthe source table after the cloning process starts will not be reflected in the\nclone.\n\n-  \u0007 \u0007Shallow clones are not self-contained tables like deep clones. If the data is\ndeleted in the source table (for example through VACUUM), your shallow clone\nmay not be usable.\n\n-  \u0007 \u0007Clones have a separate, independent history from the source table. Time travel\nqueries on your source table and clone may not return the same result.\n\n-  \u0007 \u0007Shallow clones do not copy stream transactions or COPY INTO metadata. Use\ndeep clones to migrate your tables and continue your ETL processes from\nwhere it left off.\n\n**How can I use it?**\nShallow and deep clones support new advances in how data teams test and manage\ntheir modern cloud data lakes and warehouses. Table clones can help your team\nimplement production-level testing of their pipelines, fine-tune their indexing for optimal\nquery performance, create table copies for sharing ‚Äî all with minimal overhead and\nexpense. If this is a need in your organization, we hope you will take table cloning for\na spin and give us your feedback ‚Äî we look forward to hearing about new use cases and\nextensions you would like to see in the future.\n\n**Additional resource**\n\n[Simplifying Disaster Recovery With Delta Lake](https://databricks.com/session_na20/simplifying-disaster-recovery-with-delta-lake)\n\n\ntest the data to see if it is a fit for their needs without affecting your own production\nsystems. Here deep clones again come to the rescue.\n\n-- The following code can be scheduled to run at your convenience\n\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE data_science.events CLONE prod.events;\n\n**Data archiving**\nFor regulatory or archiving purposes, all data in a table needs to be preserved for a\ncertain number of years, while the active table retains data for a few months. If you\nwant your data to be updated as soon as possible, but you have a requirement to keep\ndata for several years, storing this data in a single table and performing time travel\nmay become prohibitively expensive.\n\nIn this case, archiving your data in a daily, weekly or monthly manner is a better\nsolution.

Since its inception in the late 1980s, data warehouse technology\ncontinued to evolve and MPP architectures led to systems that were able to handle\nlarger data sizes.\n\nBut while warehouses were great for structured data, a lot of modern enterprises\nhave to deal with unstructured data, semi-structured data, and data with high variety,\nvelocity and volume. Data warehouses are not suited for many of these use cases, and\nthey are certainly not the most cost-efficient.\n\nAs companies began to collect large amounts of data from many different sources,\narchitects began envisioning a single system to house data for many different\nanalytic products and workloads.\n\nAbout a decade ago, companies began building [data lakes](https://databricks.com/glossary/data-lake) -- repositories for raw data\nin a variety of formats. While suitable for storing data, data lakes lack some critical\nfeatures: They do not support transactions, they do not enforce data quality, and their\nlack of consistency / isolation makes it almost impossible to mix appends and reads,\n\n\n-----\n\n**A lakehouse combines the best elements**\n**of data lakes and data warehouses**\nA lakehouse is a new data architecture that combines the best elements of data lakes\nand data warehouses.\n\nLakehouses are enabled by a new system design: implementing similar data structures and data management features to those in a data warehouse, directly on the\nkind of low-cost storage used for data lakes. They are what you would get if you had\nto redesign data warehouses in the modern world, now that cheap and highly reliable\nstorage (in the form of object stores) are available.\n\nA lakehouse has the following key features:\n\n-  **\u0007Transaction support:** In an enterprise lakehouse, many data pipelines will often\nbe reading and writing data concurrently. Support for ACID transactions ensures\nconsistency as multiple parties concurrently read or write data, typically using SQL.\n\n\nand batch and streaming jobs. For these reasons, many of the promises of data lakes\nhave not materialized and, in many cases, lead to a loss of many of the benefits of data\nwarehouses.\n\nThe need for a flexible, high-performance system hasn‚Äôt abated. Companies\nrequire systems for diverse data applications including SQL analytics, real-time\nmonitoring, data science and machine learning. Most of the recent advances in\nAI have been in better models to process unstructured data (text, images, video,\naudio), but these are precisely the types of data that a data warehouse is not\noptimized for.\n\nA common approach is to use multiple systems ‚Äî a data lake, several data\nwarehouses, and other specialized systems such as streaming, time-series, graph\nand image databases. Having a multitude of systems introduces complexity and,\nmore importantly, introduces delay as data professionals invariably need to move\nor copy data between different systems.\n\n\n-----\n\n**\u0007Schema enforcement and governance:** The lakehouse should have a way to\nsupport schema enforcement and evolution, supporting DW schema paradigms\nsuch as star/snowflake-schemas. The system should be able to [reason about data](https://databricks.com/blog/2019/08/21/diving-into-delta-lake-unpacking-the-transaction-log.html)\n[integrity](https://databricks.com/blog/2019/08/21/diving-into-delta-lake-unpacking-the-transaction-log.html) , and it should have robust governance and auditing mechanisms.\n\n-  **\u0007BI support:** Lakehouses enable using BI tools directly on the source data. This\nreduces staleness and improves recency, reduces latency and lowers the cost of\nhaving to operationalize two copies of the data in both a data lake and a warehouse.\n\n-  **\u0007Storage is decoupled from compute:** In practice, this means storage and compute\nuse separate clusters, thus these systems are able to scale to many more\nconcurrent users and larger data sizes. Some modern data warehouses also have\nthis property.\n\n-  **\u0007Openness:** The storage formats they use are open and standardized, such as\nParquet, and they provide an API so a variety of tools and engines, including\nmachine learning and Python/R libraries, can efficiently access the data directly.\n\n-  **\u0007Support for diverse data types ranging from unstructured to structured data:**\nThe lakehouse can be used to store, refine, analyze and access data types needed\nfor many new data applications, including images, video, audio, semi-structured\ndata, and text.\n\n-  **\u0007Support for diverse workloads:** Including data science, machine learning and SQL\nanalytics. Multiple tools might be needed to support all these workloads, but they all\nrely on the same data repository.\n\n-  **\u0007End-to-end streaming:** Real-time reports are the norm in many enterprises.\nSupport for streaming eliminates the need for separate systems dedicated to\nserving real-time data applications.\n\nThese are the key attributes of lakehouses. Enterprise-grade systems require additional\nfeatures. Tools for security and access control are basic requirements. Data governance\ncapabilities including auditing, retention and lineage have become essential particularly\nin light of recent privacy regulations. Tools that enable data discovery such as data\ncatalogs and data usage metrics are also needed. With a lakehouse, such enterprise\nfeatures only need to be implemented, tested and administered for a single system.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Read the research**\n**Delta Lake: High-Performance ACID**\n**Table Storage Over Cloud Object Stores**\n\n**Abstract**\nCloud object stores such as Amazon S3 are some of the largest and most costeffective storage systems on the planet, making the main attractive target to\nstore large data warehouses and data lakes. Unfortunately, their implementation\nas key-value stores makes it difficult to achieve ACID transactions and high\nperformance: Metadata operations, such as listing objects, are expensive, and\nconsistency guarantees are limited. In this paper, we present Delta Lake, an\nopen source ACID table storage layer over cloud object stores initially developed\nat Databricks. Delta Lake uses a transaction log that is compacted into Apache\nParquet format to provide ACID properties, time travel, and significantly faster\nmetadata operations for large tabular data sets (e.g., the ability to quickly search\nbillions of table partitions for those relevant to a query). It also leverages this\ndesign to provide high-level features such as automatic data layout optimization,\nupserts, caching, and audit logs. Delta Lake tables can be accessed from Apache\nSpark, Hive, Presto, Redshift, and other systems. Delta Lake is deployed at\nthousands of Databricks customers that process exabytes of data per day, with\nthe largest instances managing exabyte-scale data sets and billions of objects.\n\nAuthors: Michael Armbrust, Tathagata Das, Liwen Sun, Burak Yavuz, Shixiong Zhu,\nMukul Murthy, Joseph Torres, Herman van H √ñ vell, Adrian Ionescu, Alicja ≈Åuszczak,\nMicha≈Ç Szafra ÃÅnski, Xiao Li, Takuya Ueshin, Mostafa Mokhtar, Peter Boncz, Ali Ghodsi,\nSameer Paranjpye, Pieter Senster, Reynold Xin, Matei Zaharia\n\nRead the full research paper on the [inner workings of the lakehouse](https://databricks.com/research/delta-lake-high-performance-acid-table-storage-overcloud-object-stores) [.](https://databricks.com/research/delta-lake-high-performance-acid-table-storage-overcloud-object-stores)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Some early examples**\nThe [Databricks Unified Data Platform](https://databricks.com/product/data-lakehouse) has the architectural features of a lakehouse.\nMicrosoft‚Äôs [Azure Synapse Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/simply-unmatched-truly-limitless-announcing-azure-synapse-analytics/) service, which [integrates with Azure Databricks](https://databricks.com/blog/2019/11/04/new-microsoft-azure-data-warehouse-service-and-azure-databricks-combine-analytics-bi-and-data-science.html) ,\nenables a similar lakehouse pattern. Other managed services such as [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) and\n[Redshift Spectrum](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c-using-spectrum.html) have some of the lakehouse features listed above, but they are\nexamples that focus primarily on BI and other SQL applications.\n\nCompanies that want to build and implement their own systems have access to open\nsource file formats (Delta Lake, [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org) , [Apache Hudi](https://hudi.apache.org) ) that are suitable for\nbuilding a lakehouse.\n\nMerging data lakes and data warehouses into a single system means that data teams\ncan move faster as they are able to use data without needing to access multiple systems.\nThe level of SQL support and integration with BI tools among these early lakehouses\nis generally sufficient for most enterprise data warehouses. Materialized views and\nstored procedures are available, but users may need to employ other mechanisms that\naren‚Äôt equivalent to those found in traditional data warehouses. The latter is particularly\nimportant for ‚Äú [lift and shift scenarios](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/lift-and-shift) ,‚Äù which require systems that achieve semantics\nthat are almost identical to those of older, commercial data warehouses.\n\nWhat about support for other types of data applications? Users of a lakehouse have\naccess to a variety of standard tools ( [Apache Spark](https://databricks.com/glossary/apache-spark-as-a-service) , Python, R, machine learning\nlibraries) for non-BI workloads like data science and machine learning. Data\nexploration and refinement are standard for many analytic and data science\napplications. Delta Lake is designed to let users incrementally improve the quality of\ndata in their lakehouse until it is ready for consumption.\n\n\nA note about technical building blocks. While distributed file systems can be\nused for the storage layer, object stores are more commonly used in lakehouses.\nObject stores provide low-cost, highly available storage that excels at massively\nparallel reads ‚Äî an essential requirement for modern data warehouses.\n\n**From BI to AI**\nThe lakehouse is a new data management architecture that radically simplifies\nenterprise data infrastructure and accelerates innovation in an age when\nmachine learning is poised to disrupt every industry. In the past, most of the\ndata that went into a company‚Äôs products or decision-making was structured\ndata from operational systems, whereas today, many products incorporate\nAI in the form of computer vision and speech models, text mining and others.\nWhy use a lakehouse instead of a data lake for AI? A lakehouse gives you data\nversioning, governance, security and ACID properties that are needed even for\nunstructured data.\n\nCurrent lakehouses reduce cost, but their performance can still lag specialized\nsystems (such as data warehouses) that have years of investments and realworld deployments behind them. Users may favor certain tools (BI tools, IDEs,\nnotebooks) over others so lakehouses will also need to improve their UX and their\nconnectors to popular tools so they can appeal to a variety of personas. These\nand other issues will be addressed as the technology continues to mature and\ndevelop. Over time, lakehouses will close these gaps while retaining the core\nproperties of being simpler, more cost-efficient and more capable of serving\ndiverse data applications.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Diving Deep Into the**\n**Inner Workings of the**\n**Lakehouse and Delta Lake**\n\nDatabricks wrote a [blog article](https://databricks.com/blog/2020/01/30/what-is-a-data-lakehouse.html) that outlined how more and more enterprises are\nadopting the lakehouse pattern. The blog created a massive amount of interest\nfrom technology enthusiasts. While lots of people praised it as the next-generation\ndata architecture, some people thought the lakehouse is the same thing as\nthe data lake. Recently, several of our engineers and founders wrote a research\npaper that describes some of the core technological challenges and solutions that\nset the lakehouse architecture apart from the data lake, and it was accepted and\npublished at the International Conference on Very Large Databases (VLDB) 2020. You\ncan read the paper, [‚ÄúDelta Lake: High-Performance ACID Table Storage Over Cloud](https://databricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/p975-armbrust.pdf)\n[Object Stores,‚Äù here](https://databricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/p975-armbrust.pdf) .\n\nHenry Ford is often credited with having said, ‚ÄúIf I had asked people what they wanted,\nthey would have said faster horses.‚Äù The crux of this statement is that people often\nenvision a better solution to a problem as an evolution of what they already know\nrather than rethinking the approach to the problem altogether. In the world of data\nstorage, this pattern has been playing out for years. Vendors continue to try to reinvent\nthe old horses of data warehouses and data lakes rather than seek a new solution.\n\n\n-----\n\nMore than a decade ago, the cloud opened a new frontier for data storage. Cloud\nobject stores like Amazon S3 have become some of the largest and most costeffective storage systems in the world, which makes them an attractive platform to\nstore data warehouses and data lakes. However, their nature as key-value stores\nmakes it difficult to achieve ACID transactions that many organizations require. Also,\nperformance is hampered by expensive metadata operations (e.g., listing objects)\nand limited consistency guarantees.\n\nBased on the characteristics of cloud object stores, three approaches have emerged.\n\n**1. Data lakes**\nThe first is directories of files (i.e., data lakes) that store the table as a collection\nof objects, typically in columnar format such as Apache Parquet. It‚Äôs an attractive\napproach because the table is just a group of objects that can be accessed from\na wide variety of tools without a lot of additional data stores or systems. However,\nboth performance and consistency problems are common. Hidden data corruption\nis common due to failed transactions, eventual consistency leads to inconsistent\nqueries, latency is high, and basic management capabilities like table versioning and\naudit logs are unavailable.\n\n**2. Custom storage engines**\nThe second approach is custom storage engines, such as proprietary systems built for\nthe cloud like the Snowflake data warehouse. These systems can bypass the consistency\nchallenges of data lakes by managing the metadata in a separate, strongly consistent\nservice that‚Äôs able to provide a single source of truth. However, all I/O operations need\nto connect to this metadata service, which can increase cloud resource costs and\nreduce performance and availability. Additionally, it takes a lot of engineering work to\nimplement connectors to existing computing engines like Apache Spark, TensorFlow\nand PyTorch, which can be challenging for data teams that use a variety of computing\nengines on their data. Engineering challenges can be exacerbated by unstructured\ndata because these systems are generally optimized for traditional structured\n\n\n-----\n\ndata types. Finally, and most egregiously, the proprietary metadata service locks\ncustomers into a specific service provider, leaving customers to contend with\nconsistently high prices and expensive, time-consuming migrations if they decide to\nadopt a new approach later.\n\n**3. Lakehouse**\nWith Delta Lake, an open source ACID table storage layer atop cloud object stores,\nwe sought to build a car instead of a faster horse with not just a better data store,\nbut a fundamental change in how data is stored and used via the lakehouse. A\nlakehouse is a new architecture that combines the best elements of data lakes and\ndata warehouses. Lakehouses are enabled by a new system design: implementing\nsimilar data structures and data management features to those in a data warehouse,\ndirectly on the kind of low-cost storage used for data lakes. They are what you would\nget if you had to redesign storage engines in the modern world, now that cheap and\nhighly reliable storage (in the form of object stores) are available.\n\nDelta Lake maintains information about which objects are part of a Delta table in an\nACID manner, using a write-ahead log, compacted into Parquet, that is also stored in\nthe cloud object store. This design allows clients to update multiple objects at once,\nreplace a subset of the objects with another, etc., in a serializable manner that still\nachieves high parallel read/write performance from the objects. The log also provides\nsignificantly faster metadata operations for large tabular data sets. Additionally, Delta\nLake offers advanced capabilities like time travel (i.e., the ability to query point-in-time\nsnapshots or roll back erroneous updates), automatic data layout optimization, upserts,\ncaching, and audit logs. Together, these features improve both the manageability and\nperformance of working with data in cloud object stores, ultimately opening the door\nto the lakehouse architecture that combines the key features of data warehouses and\ndata lakes to create a better, simpler data architecture.\n\n\n-----\n\nToday, Delta Lake is used across thousands of Databricks customers, processing\nexabytes of structured and unstructured data each day, as well as many organizations\nin the open source community. These use cases span a variety of data sources and\napplications. The data types stored include Change Data Capture (CDC) logs from\nenterprise OLTP systems, application logs, time-series data, graphs, aggregate\ntables for reporting, and image or feature data for machine learning. The applications\ninclude SQL workloads (most commonly), business intelligence, streaming, data\nscience, machine learning and graph analytics. Overall, Delta Lake has proven itself to\nbe a good fit for most data lake applications that would have used structured storage\nformats like Parquet or ORC, and many traditional data warehousing workloads.\n\nAcross these use cases, we found that customers often use Delta Lake to significantly\nsimplify their data architecture by running more workloads directly against cloud\nobject stores, and increasingly, by creating a lakehouse with both data lake and\ntransactional features to replace some or all of the functionality provided by message\nqueues (e.g., Apache Kafka), data lakes or cloud data warehouses (e.g., Snowflake,\nAmazon Redshift).\n\n**[In the research paper](https://databricks.com/research/delta-lake-high-performance-acid-table-storage-overcloud-object-stores)** **, the authors explain:**\n\n-  The characteristics and challenges of object stores\n\n-  The Delta Lake storage format and access protocols\n\n-  The current features, benefits and limitations of Delta Lake\n\n-  Both the core and specialized use cases commonly employed today\n\n-  Performance experiments, including TPC-DS performance\n\nThrough the paper, you‚Äôll gain a better understanding of Delta Lake and how it\nenables a wide range of DBMS-like performance and management features for data\nheld in low-cost cloud storage. As well as how the Delta Lake storage format and\naccess protocols make it simple to operate, highly available, and able to deliver highbandwidth access to the object store.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Understanding**\n**Delta Engine**\n\nThe Delta Engine ties together a 100% Apache Spark-compatible vectorized query\nengine to take advantage of modern CPU architecture with optimizations to Spark\n3.0‚Äôs query optimizer and caching capabilities that were launched as part of Databricks\nRuntime 7.0. Together, these features significantly accelerate query performance on\ndata lakes, especially those enabled by [Delta Lake](https://databricks.com/product/delta-lake-on-databricks) , to make it easier for customers to\nadopt and scale a [lakehouse architecture](https://databricks.com/blog/2020/01/30/what-is-a-data-lakehouse.html) .\n\n**Scaling execution performance**\nOne of the big hardware trends over the last several years is that CPU clock speeds\nhave plateaued. The reasons are outside the scope of this chapter, but the takeaway\nis that we have to find new ways to process data faster beyond raw compute power.\nOne of the most impactful methods has been to improve the amount of data that can\nbe processed in parallel. However, data processing engines need to be specifically\narchitected to take advantage of this parallelism.\n\nIn addition, data teams are being given less and less time to properly model data as\nthe pace of business increases. Poorer modeling in the interest of better business\nagility drives poorer query performance. Naturally, this is not a desired state, and\norganizations want to find ways to maximize both agility and performance.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Announcing Delta Engine for**\n**high-performance query execution**\nDelta Engine accelerates the performance of Delta Lake for SQL and DataFrame\nworkloads through three components: an improved query optimizer, a caching\nlayer that sits between the execution layer and the cloud object storage, and a native\nvectorized execution engine that‚Äôs written in C++.\n\nThe improved query optimizer extends the functionality already in Spark 3.0 (cost-based\noptimizer, adaptive query execution, and dynamic runtime filters) with more advanced\nstatistics to deliver up to 18x increased performance in star schema workloads.\n\nDelta Engine‚Äôs caching layer automatically chooses which input data to cache for the\nuser, transcoding it along the way in a more CPU-efficient format to better leverage\nthe increased storage speeds of NVMe SSDs. This delivers up to 5x faster scan\nperformance for virtually all workloads.\n\nHowever, the biggest innovation in Delta Engine to tackle the challenges facing\ndata teams today is the native execution engine, which we call Photon. (We know.\nIt‚Äôs in an engine within the engine‚Ä¶). This completely rewritten execution engine for\n\n\n-----\n\nDatabricks has been built to maximize the performance from the new changes in\nmodern cloud hardware. It brings performance improvements to all workload types\nwhile remaining fully compatible with open Spark APIs.\n\n**Getting started with Delta Engine**\nBy linking these three components together, we think it will be easier for customers\nto understand how improvements in multiple places within the Databricks code\naggregate into significantly faster performance for analytics workloads on data lakes.\n\nWe‚Äôre excited about the value that Delta Engine delivers to our customers. While the\ntime and cost savings are already valuable, its role in the lakehouse pattern supports\nnew advances in how data teams design their data architectures for increased\nunification and simplicity.\n\nFor more information on the Delta Engine, watch this keynote address from\n[Spark + AI Summit 2020: Delta Engine: High-Performance Query Engine for Delta Lake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o54YMz8zvCY) .\n\n\n-----\n\n**Streaming**\nUsing Delta Lake to express\ncomputation on streaming data\n\n## CHAPTER 04\n\n\n-----\n\n**How Delta Lake Solves Common**\n**Pain Points in Streaming**\n\nThe pain points of a traditional streaming and data warehousing solution can be\nbroken into two groups: data lake and data warehouse pains.\n\n**Data lake pain points**\nWhile data lakes allow you to flexibly store an immense amount of data in a file system,\nthere are many pain points including (but not limited to):\n\n-  Consolidation of streaming data from many disparate systems is difficult.\n\n-  Updating data in a data lake is nearly impossible, and much of the streaming\ndata needs to be updated as changes are made. This is especially important in\nscenarios involving financial reconciliation and subsequent adjustments.\n\n-  Query speeds for a data lake are typically very slow.\n\n-  Optimizing storage and file sizes is very difficult and often requires complicated logic.\n\n**Data warehouse pain points**\nThe power of a data warehouse is that you have a persistent performant store of your\ndata. But the pain points for building modern continuous applications include (but are\nnot limited to):\n\n-  Constrained to SQL queries (i.e., no machine learning or advanced analytics).\n\n-  Accessing streaming data and stored data together is very difficult, if at all possible.\n\n-  Data warehouses do not scale very well.\n\n-  Tying compute and storage together makes using a warehouse very expensive.\n\n\n-----\n\n**How Delta Lake on Databricks solves these issues**\n[Delta Lake](https://docs.databricks.com/delta/index.html) is a unified data management system that brings data reliability and\nperformance optimizations to cloud data lakes. More succinctly, Delta Lake combines\nthe advantages of data lakes and data warehouses with Apache Spark‚Ñ¢ to allow you\nto do incredible things.\n\n-  Delta Lake, along with Structured Streaming, makes it possible to analyze\nstreaming and historical data together at high speeds.\n\n-  When Delta Lake tables are used as sources and destinations of streaming big\ndata, it is easy to consolidate disparate data sources.\n\n-  Upserts are supported on Delta Lake tables.\n\n-  Delta Lake is ACID compliant, making it easy to create a compliant data solution.\n\n-  Easily include machine learning scoring and advanced analytics into ETL\nand queries.\n\n-  Decouples compute and storage for a completely scalable solution.\n\nIn the following use cases, we‚Äôll share what this looks like in practice.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Simplifying Streaming Stock**\n**Data Analysis Using Delta Lake**\n\nReal-time analysis of stock data is a complicated endeavor. After all, there are many\nchallenges in maintaining a streaming system and ensuring transactional consistency\nof legacy and streaming data concurrently.\n\nThankfully, [Delta Lake](https://databricks.com/product/delta-lake-on-databricks) helps solve many of the pain points of building a streaming\nsystem to analyze stock data in real time. In this section, we‚Äôll share how to simplify\nthe streaming of stock data analysis using Delta Lake.\n\nIn the following diagram, you can see a high-level architecture that simplifies this\nproblem. We start by ingesting two different sets of data into two Delta Lake tables.\nThe two data sets are stock prices and fundamentals.\n\nAfter ingesting the data into their respective tables, we then join the data in an ETL\nprocess and write the data out into a third Delta Lake table for downstream analysis.\n\nDelta Lake helps solve these problems by combining the scalability, streaming and\naccess to the advanced analytics of Apache Spark with the performance and ACID\ncompliance of a data warehouse.\n\n\n-----\n\n# Create Fundamental Data (Databricks Delta table)\n\ndfBaseFund = spark \\\\\n\n.read \\\\\n\n.format( ‚Äòdelta‚Äô ) \\\\\n\n.load( ‚Äò/delta/stocksFundamentals‚Äô )\n\n# Create Price Data (Databricks Delta table)\n\ndfBasePrice = spark \\\\\n\n.read \\\\\n\n.format( ‚Äòdelta‚Äô ) \\\\\n\n.load( ‚Äò/delta/stocksDailyPrices‚Äô )\n\n\n**Implement your streaming**\n**stock analysis solution with Delta Lake**\nDelta Lake and Apache Spark do most of the work for our solution; you can try out the\nfull [notebook](https://pages.databricks.com/rs/094-YMS-629/images/streaming-stock-data-analysis-setup.html) and follow along with the code samples below.\n\nAs noted in the preceding diagram, we have two data sets to process ‚Äî one for\nfundamentals and one for price data. To create our two Delta Lake tables, we specify\nthe .format(‚Äòdelta‚Äô) against our Databricks File System ( [DBFS](https://docs.databricks.com/data/databricks-file-system.html) ) locations.\n\n\n-----\n\nWhile we‚Äôre updating the stockFundamentals and stocksDailyPrices ,\nwe will consolidate this data through a series of ETL jobs into a consolidated view\n( stocksDailyPricesWFund ).\n\nWith the following code snippet, we can determine the start and end date of available\ndata and then combine the price and fundamentals data for that date range into DBFS.\n\n# Determine start and end date of available data\n\nrow = dfBasePrice.agg(\n\nfunc.max(dfBasePrice.price_date) .alias ( ‚ÄúmaxDate‚Äù ),\n\nfunc.min(dfBasePrice.price_date) .alias ( ‚ÄúminDate‚Äù )\n\n).collect()[ 0 ]\n\nstartDate = row[ ‚ÄúminDate‚Äù ]\n\nendDate = row[ ‚ÄúmaxDate‚Äù ]\n\n# Define our date range function\n\n\n# Save data to DBFS\n\ndfPriceWFund\n\n.write\n\n.format( ‚Äòdelta‚Äô )\n\n.mode( ‚Äòappend‚Äô )\n\n.save( ‚Äò/delta/stocksDailyPricesWFund‚Äô )\n\n# Loop through dates to complete fundamentals + price ETL process\n\nfor single_date in daterange(\n\nstartDate, (endDate + datetime.timedelta(days= 1 ))\n\n):\n\nprint ‚ÄòStarting ‚Äô + single_date.strftime( ‚Äò%Y-%m-%d‚Äô )\n\nstart = datetime.datetime.now()\n\ncombinePriceAndFund(single_date)\n\nend = datetime.datetime.now()\n\nprint ( end -  start)\n\n\ndef daterange(start_date, end_date):\n\n\nNow we have a stream of consolidated fundamentals and price data that is being\npushed into [DBFS](https://docs.databricks.com/data/databricks-file-system.html) in the /delta/stocksDailyPricesWFund location. We can build a\nDelta Lake table by specifying .format(‚Äúdelta‚Äù) against that DBFS location.\n\n\nfor n in range( int ((end_date - start_date).days)):\n\nyield start_date + datetime.timedelta(n)\n\n\n# Define combinePriceAndFund information by date and\n\n\ndef combinePriceAndFund(theDate):\n\ndfFund = dfBaseFund. where (dfBaseFund.price_date == theDate)\n\ndfPrice = dfBasePrice. where (\n\ndfBasePrice.price_date == theDate\n\n\ndfPriceWithFundamentals = spark\n\n.readStream\n\n.format( ‚Äúdelta‚Äù )\n\n.load( ‚Äú/delta/stocksDailyPricesWFund‚Äù )\n\n\n).drop( ‚Äòprice_date‚Äô )\n\n\n# Drop the updated column\n\ndfPriceWFund = dfPrice.join(dfFund, [ ‚Äòticker‚Äô ]).drop( ‚Äòupdated‚Äô )\n\n\n// Create temporary view of the data\n\ndfPriceWithFundamentals.createOrReplaceTempView( ‚ÄúpriceWithFundamentals‚Äù )\n\n\n-----\n\nNow that we have created our initial Delta Lake table, let‚Äôs create a view that will\nallow us to calculate the price/earnings ratio in real time (because of the underlying\nstreaming data updating our Delta Lake table).\n\n%sql\n\nCREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW viewPE AS\n\nselect ticker,\n\nprice_date,\n\nfirst(close) as price,\n\n(close/eps_basic_net) as pe\n\nfrom priceWithFundamentals\n\nwhere eps_basic_net > 0\n\ngroup by ticker, price_date, pe\n\n**Analyze streaming stock data in real time**\nWith our view in place, we can quickly analyze our data using Spark SQL.\n\n%sql\n\nselect - \n\nfrom viewPE\n\nwhere ticker == ‚ÄúAAPL‚Äù\n\norder by price_date\n\n\n-----\n\nAs the underlying source of this consolidated data set is a Delta Lake table, this view\nisn‚Äôt just showing the batch data but also any new streams of data that are coming in\nas per the following streaming dashboard.\n\nUnderneath the covers, Structured Streaming isn‚Äôt just writing the data to Delta Lake\ntables but also keeping the state of the distinct number of keys (in this case ticker\nsymbols) that need to be tracked.\n\n\nBecause you are using Spark SQL, you can execute aggregate queries at scale\nand in real time.\n\n%sql\n\nSELECT ticker, AVG(close) as Average_Close\n\nFROM priceWithFundamentals\n\nGROUP BY ticker\n\nORDER BY Average_Close\n\nIn closing, we demonstrated how to simplify streaming stock data analysis using\n[Delta Lake](https://databricks.com/product/delta-lake-on-databricks) . By combining Spark Structured Streaming and Delta Lake, we can use the\nDatabricks integrated workspace to create a performant, scalable solution that has\nthe advantages of both data lakes and data warehouses.\n\nThe [Databricks Unified Data Platform](https://databricks.com/product/data-lakehouse) removes the data engineering complexities\ncommonly associated with streaming and transactional consistency, enabling\ndata engineering and data science teams to focus on understanding the trends in\ntheir stock data.\n\n\n-----\n\n**How Tilting Point Does Streaming**\n**Ingestion Into Delta Lake**\n\nTilting Point is a new-generation games partner that provides top development\nstudios with expert resources, services and operational support to optimize\nhigh-quality live games for success. Through its user acquisition fund and its\nworld-class technology platform, Tilting Point funds and runs performance\nmarketing management and live games operations to help developers achieve\nprofitable scale.\n\nBy leveraging Delta Lake, Tilting Point is able to leverage quality data and make\nit readily available for analytics to improve the business. Diego Link, VP of\nEngineering at Tilting Point, provided insights for this use case.\n\nThe team at Tilting Point was running daily and hourly batch jobs for reporting on\ngame analytics. They wanted to make their reporting near real-time, getting insights\nwithin 5‚Äì10 minutes.\n\nThey also wanted to make their in-game LiveOps decisions based on real-time player\nbehavior for giving real-time data to a bundles-and-offer system, provide up-to-theminute alerting on LiveOPs changes that actually might have unforeseen detrimental\neffects and even alert on service interruptions in game operations. The goal was to\nensure that the game experience was as robust as possible for their players.\n\nAdditionally, they had to store encrypted Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data\nseparately in order to maintain GDPR compliance.\n\n\n-----\n\n**How data flows and associated challenges**\nTilting Point has a proprietary software development kit that developers integrate\nwith to send data from game servers to an ingest server hosted in AWS. This service\nremoves all PII data and then sends the raw data to an Amazon Firehose endpoint.\nFirehose then dumps the data in JSON format continuously to S3.\n\nTo clean up the raw data and make it available quickly for analytics, the team\nconsidered pushing the continuous data from Firehose to a message bus (e.g.,\nKafka, Kinesis) and then using [Apache Spark‚Äôs Structured Streaming](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html) to continuously\nprocess data and write to Delta Lake tables.\n\nWhile that architecture sounds ideal for low latency requirements of processing\ndata in seconds, Tilting Point didn‚Äôt have such low latency needs for their ingestion\npipeline. They wanted to make the data available for analytics in a few minutes, not\nseconds. Hence they decided to simplify our architecture by eliminating a message\nbus and instead use S3 as a continuous source for their structured streaming job.\n\nBut the key challenge in using S3 as a continuous source is identifying files that\nchanged recently.\n\nListing all files every few minutes has two major issues:\n\n-  **Higher latency:** Listing all files in a directory with a large number of files has high\noverhead and increases processing time.\n\n-  **Higher cost:** Listing lots of files every few minutes can quickly add to the S3 cost.\n\n**Leveraging Structured Streaming with blob store as**\n**source and Delta Lake tables as sink**\nTo continuously stream data from cloud blob storage like S3, Tilting Point uses\n[Databricks‚Äô S3-SQS source](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/structured-streaming/sqs.html#optimized-s3-file-source-with-sqs) . The S3-SQS source provides an easy way to incrementally\nstream data from S3 without the need to write any state management code on what\nfiles were recently processed.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis is how Tilting Point‚Äôs ingestion pipeline looks:\n\n-  [Configure Amazon S3 event notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html) to send new file arrival information\nto SQS via SNS.\n\n-  Tilting Point uses the S3-SQS source to read the new data arriving in S3. The S3SQS source reads the new file names that arrived in S3 from SQS and uses that\ninformation to read the actual file contents in S3. An example code below:\n\nspark.readStream \\\n\n.format( ‚Äús3-sqs‚Äù ) \\\n\n. option ( ‚ÄúfileFormat‚Äù , ‚Äújson‚Äù ) \\\n\n. option ( ‚ÄúqueueUrl‚Äù , ...) \\\n\n. schema (...) \\\n\n. load ()\n\n-  Tilting Point‚Äôs structured streaming job then cleans up and transforms the data.\nBased on the game data, the streaming job uses the foreachBatch API of Spark\nstreaming and writes to 30 different Delta Lake tables.\n\n-  The streaming job produces lots of small files. This affects performance of\ndownstream consumers. So, an optimize job runs daily to compact small files in\nthe table and store them as right file sizes so that consumers of the data have\ngood performance while reading the data from Delta Lake tables. Tilting Point\nalso runs a weekly optimize job for a second round of compaction. Architecture showing continuous data ingest into Delta Lake tables\n\n\n-----\n\nThe above Delta Lake ingestion architecture helps in the following ways:\n\n-  **Incremental loading:** The S3-SQS source incrementally loads the new files in S3.\nThis helps quickly process the new files without too much overhead in listing files.\n\n-  **No explicit file state management:** There is no explicit file state management\nneeded to look for recent files.\n\n-  **Lower operational burden:** Since we use S3 as a checkpoint between Firehose\nand Structured Streaming jobs, the operational burden to stop streams and reprocess data is relatively low.\n\n-  **Reliable ingestion:** Delta Lake uses [optimistic concurrency control](https://docs.databricks.com/delta/optimizations/isolation-level.html) to offer ACID\ntransactional guarantees. This helps with reliable data ingestion.\n\n-  **File compaction:** One of the major problems with streaming ingestion is tables\nending up with a large number of small files that can affect read performance.\nBefore Delta Lake, we had to set up a different table to write the compacted\ndata. With Delta Lake, thanks to ACID transactions, we can compact the files and\nrewrite the data back to the same table safely.\n\n-  **Snapshot isolation:** Delta Lake‚Äôs snapshot isolation allows us to expose the\ningestion tables to downstream consumers while data is being appended by a\nstreaming job and modified during compaction.\n\n-  **Rollbacks:** In case of bad writes, [Delta Lake‚Äôs Time Travel](https://databricks.com/blog/2019/02/04/introducing-delta-time-travel-for-large-scale-data-lakes.html) helps us roll back to a\nprevious version of the table.\n\nIn this section, we walked through Tilting Point‚Äôs use cases and how they do\nstreaming ingestion using Databricks‚Äô S3-SQS source into Delta Lake tables\nefficiently without too much operational overhead to make good quality data\nreadily available for analytics.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Building a Quality of Service**\n**Analytics Solution for Streaming**\n**Video Services**\n\nAs traditional pay TV , content owners have embraced directto-consumer (D2C) subscription and ad-supported streaming for monetizing their [continues to stagnate](https://nscreenmedia.com/us-tv-market-svod-exceed-pay-tv-2020/)\nlibraries of content. For companies whose entire business model revolved around\nproducing great content, which they then licensed to distributors, the shift to now\nowning the entire glass-to-glass experience has required new capabilities, such as\nbuilding media supply chains for content delivery to consumers, supporting apps for\na myriad of devices and operating systems, and performing customer relationship\nfunctions like billing and customer service.\n\nWith most services renewing on a monthly basis, subscription service operators need\nto prove value to their subscribers at all times. General quality of streaming video\nissues (encompassing buffering, latency, pixelation, jitter, packet loss and the blank\nscreen) have significant business impacts, whether it‚Äôs increased [subscriber churn](https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=112209) or\n[decreased video engagement](https://www.tvtechnology.com/opinions/why-buffering-remains-every-video-providers-worst-nightmare) .\n\nWhen you start streaming, you realize there are so many places where breaks can\nhappen and the viewer experience can suffer. There may be an issue at the source in\nthe servers on-premises or in the cloud; in transit at either the CDN level or ISP level\nor the viewer‚Äôs home network; or at the playout level with player/client issues. What\nbreaks at n x 104 concurrent streamers is different from what breaks at n x 105 or n\nx 106. There is no pre-release testing that can quite replicate real-world users and\ntheir ability to push even the most redundant systems to their breaking point as they\n\n\n-----\n\nchannel surf, click in and out of the app, sign on from different devices simultaneously\nand so on. And because of the nature of TV, things will go wrong during the most\nimportant, high-profile events drawing the largest audiences. If you start [receiving](https://downdetector.com/)\n[complaints on social media](https://downdetector.com/) , how can you tell if they are unique to that one user or\nrather regional or a national issue? If national, is it across all devices or only certain\ntypes (e.g., possibly the OEM updated the OS on an older device type, which ended up\ncausing compatibility issues with the client)?\n\nIdentifying, remediating and preventing viewer quality of experience issues becomes\na big data problem when you consider the number of users, the number of actions\nthey are taking and the number of handoffs in the experience (servers to CDN to ISP to\nhome network to client). Quality of Service (QoS) helps make sense of these streams\nof data so you can understand what is going wrong, where and why. Eventually you\ncan get into predictive analytics around what could go wrong and how to remediate\nit before anything breaks.\n\n**Databricks Quality of Service solution overview**\nThe aim of this solution is to provide the core for any streaming video platform that\nwants to improve their QoS system. It is based on the [AWS Streaming Media Analytics](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-streaming-media-analytics)\n[Solution](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-streaming-media-analytics) provided by AWS Labs, which we then built on top of to add Databricks as\na Unified Data Analytics Platform for both the real-time insights and the advanced\nanalytics capabilities.\n\n[By using Databricks](https://databricks.com/customers) , streaming platforms can get faster insights by always\nleveraging the most complete and recent data sets powered by robust and reliable\ndata pipelines. This decreases time to market for new features by accelerating\ndata science using a collaborative environment. It provides support for managing\nthe end-to-end machine learning lifecycle and reduces operational costs across\nall cycles of software development by having a unified platform for both data\nengineering and data science.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Video QoS solution architecture**\nWith complexities like low-latency monitoring alerts and highly scalable infrastructure\nrequired for peak video traffic hours, the straightforward architectural choice was\nthe Delta Architecture ‚Äî both standard big data architectures like Lambda and Kappa\nArchitectures have disadvantages around the operational effort required to maintain\nmultiple types of pipelines (streaming and batch) and lack support for a unified data\nengineering and data science approach.\n\nThe Delta Architecture is the next-generation paradigm that enables all the data\npersonas in your organization to be more productive:\n\n-  Data engineers can develop data pipelines in a cost-efficient manner\ncontinuously without having to choose between batch and streaming\n\n-  Data analysts can get near real-time insights and faster answers to their BI queries\n\n-  Data scientists can develop better machine learning models using more reliable data\nsets with support for time travel that facilitates reproducible experiments and reports Delta Architecture using the ‚Äúmulti-hop‚Äù approach for data pipelines\n\n\n-----\n\nWriting data pipelines using the Delta Architecture follows the best practices of\nhaving a multi-layer ‚Äúmulti-hop‚Äù approach where we progressively add structure to\ndata: ‚ÄúBronze‚Äù tables or Ingestion tables are usually raw data sets in the native format\n(JSON, CSV or txt), ‚ÄúSilver‚Äù tables represent cleaned/transformed data sets ready for\nreporting or data science, and ‚ÄúGold‚Äù tables are the final presentation layer.\n\nFor the pure streaming use cases, the option of materializing the DataFrames in\nintermediate Delta Lake tables is basically just a trade-off between latency/SLAs and\ncost (an example being real-time monitoring alerts vs. updates of the recommender\nsystem based on new content).\n\nA streaming architecture can still be achieved while materializing DataFrames in Delta Lake tables\n\nThe number of ‚Äúhops‚Äù in this approach is directly impacted by the number of consumers\ndownstream, complexity of the aggregations (e.g., Structured Streaming enforces\ncertain limitations around chaining multiple aggregations) and the maximization of\noperational efficiency.\n\nThe QoS solution architecture is focused around best practices for data processing\nand is not a full video-on-demand (VoD) solution ‚Äî with some standard components\nlike the ‚Äúfront door‚Äù service Amazon API Gateway being avoided from the high-level\narchitecture in order to keep the focus on data and analytics.\n\n\n-----\n\nHigh-level architecture for the QoS platform\n\n\n**Making your data ready for analytics**\nBoth sources of data included in the QoS solution (application events and CDN logs)\nare using the JSON format, great for data exchange ‚Äî allowing you to represent\ncomplex nested structures, but not scalable and difficult to maintain as a storage\nformat for your data lake / analytics system.\n\n\nIn order to make the data directly queryable across the entire organization, the\nBronze to Silver pipeline (the ‚Äúmake your data available to everyone‚Äù pipeline) should\ntransform any raw formats into Delta Lake and include all the quality checks or data\nmasking required by any regulatory agencies.\n\n\n-----\n\nRaw format of the app events\n\n**Video applications events**\nBased on the architecture, the video application events are pushed directly to\nKinesis Streams and then just ingested to a Delta Lake append-only table without\nany changes to the schema.\n\nUsing this pattern allows a high number of consumers downstream to process the\ndata in a streaming paradigm without having to scale the throughput of the Kinesis\nstream. As a side effect of using a Delta Lake table as a sink (which supports [optimize](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/spark-sql/language-manual/delta-optimize.html) !),\nwe don‚Äôt have to worry about the way the size of the processing window will impact the\nnumber of files in your target table ‚Äî known as the ‚Äúsmall files‚Äù issue in the big data world.\n\nBoth the timestamp and the type of message are being extracted from the JSON\nevent in order to be able to partition the data and allow consumers to choose the\ntype of events they want to process. Again combining a single Kinesis stream for\nthe events with a Delta Lake ‚ÄúEvents‚Äù table reduces the operational complexity while\nmaking things easier for scaling during peak hours.\n\n\nAll the details are extracted from JSON for the Silver table\n\n\n-----\n\n**CDN logs**\nThe CDN logs are delivered to S3, so the easiest way to process them is the Databricks\nAuto Loader, which incrementally and efficiently processes new data files as they\narrive in S3 without any additional setup.\n\nauto_loader_df = spark.readStream.format( ‚ÄúcloudFiles‚Äù ) \\\n\n.option( ‚ÄúcloudFiles.format‚Äù , ‚Äújson‚Äù ) \\\n\n.option( ‚ÄúcloudFiles.region‚Äù , region) \\\n\n.load(input_location)\n\nanonymized_df = auto_loader_df. select ( ‚Äò*‚Äô , ip_\n\nanonymizer( ‚Äòrequestip‚Äô ). alias ( ‚Äòip‚Äô ))\\\n\n.drop( ‚Äòrequestip‚Äô )\\\n\n.withColumn( ‚Äúorigin‚Äù , map_ip_to_location(col( ‚Äòip‚Äô )))\n\nanonymized_df.writeStream \\\n\n.option( ‚ÄòcheckpointLocation‚Äô , checkpoint_location)\\\n\n.format( ‚Äòdelta‚Äô ) \\\n\n.table(silver_database + ‚Äò.cdn_logs‚Äô )\n\nAs the logs contain IPs ‚Äî considered personal data under the GDPR regulations ‚Äî the\n‚Äúmake your data available to everyone‚Äù pipeline has to include an anonymization step.\nDifferent techniques can be used, but we decided to just strip the last octet from IPv4\nand the last 80 bits from IPv6. On top, the data set is also enriched with information\naround the origin country and the ISP provider, which will be used later in the Network\nOperation Centers for localization.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Creating the Dashboard /**\n**Virtual Network Operation Centers**\nStreaming companies need to monitor network performance and the user experience\nas near real-time as possible, tracking down to the individual level with the ability to\nabstract at the segment level, easily defining new segments such as those defined by\ngeos, devices, networks and/or current and historical viewing behavior.\n\nFor streaming companies that has meant adopting the concept of Network Operation\nCenters (NOC) from telco networks for monitoring the health of the streaming\nexperience for their users at a macro level, flagging and responding to any issues\nearly on. At their most basic, NOCs should have dashboards that compare the current\nexperience for users against a performance baseline so that the product teams can\nquickly and easily identify and attend to any service anomalies.\n\nIn the QoS solution we have incorporated a [Databricks dashboard](https://docs.databricks.com/notebooks/dashboards.html) . BI tools can also\nbe effortlessly connected in order to build more complex visualizations, but based\non customer feedback, built-in dashboards are, most of the time, the fastest way to\npresent the insights to business users.\n\nThe aggregated tables for the NOC will basically be the Gold layer of our Delta\nArchitecture ‚Äî a combination of CDN logs and the application events. Example of Network Operations Center dashboard\n\n\n-----\n\nThe dashboard is just a way to visually package the results of SQL queries or Python\n/ R transformation ‚Äî each notebook supports multiple dashboards so in case of\nmultiple end users with different requirements we don‚Äôt have to duplicate the code ‚Äî\nas a bonus the refresh can also be scheduled as a Databricks job.\n\nVisualization of the results of a SQL query\n\nLoading time for videos (time to first frame) allows better understanding of the\nperformance for individual locations of your CDN ‚Äî in this case the AWS CloudFront\nEdge nodes ‚Äî which has a direct impact in your strategy for improving this KPI ‚Äî\neither by spreading the user traffic over multi-CDNs or maybe just implementing a\ndynamic origin selection in case of AWS CloudFront using Lambda@Edge.\n\n\n-----\n\nFailure to understand the reasons for high levels of buffering ‚Äî and the poor video\nquality experience that it brings ‚Äî has a significant impact on subscriber churn rate.\nOn top of that, advertisers are not willing to spend money on ads responsible for\nreducing the viewer engagement ‚Äî as they add extra buffering on top, so the profits\non the advertising business usually are impacted too. In this context, collecting as\nmuch information as possible from the application side is crucial to allow the analysis\nto be done not only at video level but also browser or even type / version of application.\n\nOn the content side, events for the application can provide useful information about\nuser behavior and overall quality of experience. How many people that paused a video\nhave actually finished watching that episode / video? What caused the stoppage: The\nquality of the content or delivery issues? Of course, further analyses can be done by\nlinking all the sources together (user behavior, performance of CDNs /ISPs) to not only\ncreate a user profile but also to forecast churn.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Creating (near) real-time alerts**\nWhen dealing with the velocity, volume and variety of data generated in video\nstreaming from millions of concurrent users, dashboard complexity can make it\nharder for human operators in the NOC to focus on the most important data at the\nmoment and zero-in on root cause issues. With this solution, you can easily set up\nautomated alerts when performance crosses certain thresholds that can help the\nhuman operators of the network as well as set off automatic remediation protocols\nvia a Lambda function. For example:\n\n-  If a CDN is having latency much higher than baseline (e.g., if it‚Äôs more than 10%\nlatency vs. baseline average), initiate automatic CDN traffic shifts.\n\n-  If more than [some threshold, e.g., 5%] of clients report playback errors, alert the\nproduct team that there is likely a client issue for a specific device.\n\n-  If viewers on a certain ISP are having higher-than-average buffering and\npixelation issues, alert frontline customer representatives on responses and ways\nto decrease issues (e.g., set stream quality lower).\n\nFrom a technical perspective, generating real-time alerts requires a streaming\nengine capable of processing data real time and publish-subscribe service to push\nnotifications.\n\n\nupdates of web applications) or Amazon SQS for other consumers. The [custom for](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/structured-streaming/foreach.html)\n[each writer](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/structured-streaming/foreach.html) option makes the writing of a pipeline to send email notifications based\non a rule-based engine (e.g., validating the percentage of errors for each individual\ntype of app over a period of time) really straightforward.\n\ndef send_error_notification(row):\n\nsns_client = boto3.client( ‚Äòsns‚Äô , region)\n\nerror_message = ‚ÄòNumber of errors for the App has exceeded the\n\nthreshold {}‚Äô .format(row[ ‚Äòpercentage‚Äô ])\n\nresponse = sns_client.publish(\n\nTopicArn =,\n\nMessage = error_message,\n\nSubject =,\n\nMessageStructure = ‚Äòstring‚Äô )\n\n# Structured Streaming Job\n\ngetKinesisStream( ‚Äúplayer_events‚Äù )\\\n\n.selectExpr( ‚Äútype‚Äù , ‚Äúapp_type‚Äù )\\\n\n.groupBy( ‚Äúapp_type‚Äù )\\\n\n.apply(calculate_error_percentage)\\\n\n. where ( ‚Äúpercentage > {}‚Äù .format(threshold)) \\\n\n.writeStream\\\n\n. foreach (send_error_notification)\\\n\n.start()\n\n\nIntegrating microservices using Amazon SNS and Amazon SQS\n\nSending email notifications using AWS SNS\n\nThe QoS solution implements the [AWS best practices for integrating microservices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/microservices-on-aws/introduction.html)\nby using Amazon SNS and its integrations with Amazon Lambda (see below for the\n\n\n-----\n\nOn top of the basic email use case, the Demo Player includes three widgets updated\nin real time using AWS AppSync: the number of active users, the most popular videos\nand the number of users concurrently watching a video.\n\nUpdating the application with the results of real-time aggregations\n\nThe QoS solution is applying a similar approach ‚Äî Structured Streaming and Amazon\nSNS ‚Äî to update all the values allowing for extra consumers to be plugged in using AWS\nSQS. This is a common pattern when huge volumes of events have to be enhanced and\nanalyzed; pre-aggregate data once and allow each service (consumer) to make their\nown decision downstream.\n\n**Next steps: machine learning**\nManually making sense of the historical data is important but is also very slow. If\nwe want to be able to make automated decisions in the future, we have to integrate\nmachine learning algorithms.\n\nAs a Unified Data Platform, Databricks empowers data scientists to build better data\nscience products using features like Runtime for Machine Learning with built-in\nor the integration with MLflow, the end-toend machine learning lifecycle management tool. support for [Hyperopt](https://docs.databricks.com/applications/machine-learning/automl-hyperparam-tuning/index.html#hyperopt-overview) / [Horvod](https://docs.databricks.com/applications/machine-learning/train-model/distributed-training/horovod-runner.html) / [AutoML](https://databricks.com/product/automl-on-databricks)\n\n\n-----\n\nWe have already explored a few important use cases across our customer base while\nfocusing on the possible extensions to the QoS solution.\n\n**Point-of-failure prediction and remediation**\nAs D2C streamers reach more users, the costs of even momentary loss of service\nincreases. ML can help operators move from reporting to prevention by forecasting\nwhere issues could come up and remediating before anything goes wrong (e.g.,\na spike in concurrent viewers leads to switching CDNs to one with more capacity\nautomatically).\n\n**Customer churn**\nCritical to growing subscription services is keeping the subscribers you have. By\nunderstanding the quality of service at the individual level, you can add QoS as a\nvariable in churn and customer lifetime value models. Additionally, you can create\ncustomer cohorts for those who have had video quality issues in order to test\nproactive messaging and save offers.\n\n\n**Getting started with the Databricks streaming video**\n**QoS solution**\nProviding consistent quality in the streaming video experience is table stakes at this\npoint to keep fickle audiences with ample entertainment options on your platform.\nWith this solution we have sought to create a quick start for most streaming video\nplatform environments to embed this QoS real-time streaming analytics solution in\na way that:\n1. Scales to any audience size\n2. Quickly flags quality performance issues at key parts of the distribution workflow\n3. Is flexible and modular enough to easily customize for your audience and your\nneeds, such as creating new automated alerts or enabling data scientists to test\nand roll out predictive analytics and machine learning\n\nTo get started, download the notebooks for the [Databricks streaming video QoS](https://databricks.com/notebooks/QoS/index.html#00.config.html)\n[solution](https://databricks.com/notebooks/QoS/index.html#00.config.html) .

With\ngovernance requirements, siloed teams and a legacy system that was difficult\nto scale, they moved to Databricks. This boosted data processing for downstream\nmachine learning while improving data security to meet HIPAA requirements.\n\n**Spotlight on Healthdirect**\n**Industry:** Healthcare and life sciences\n6x\nImprovement in data processing\n20M\nRecords ingested in minutes\n\n**Data quality and governance issues, silos, and the**\n**inability to scale**\nDue to regulatory pressures, Healthdirect Australia set forth to improve overall data\nquality and ensure a level of governance on top of that, but they ran into challenges\nwhen it came to data storage and access. On top of that, data silos were blocking the\nteam from efficiently preparing data for downstream analytics. These disjointed data\n\n\n-----\n\nsources impacted the consistency of data reads, as data was oftentimes out-of-sync\nbetween the various systems in their stack. The low-quality data also led to higher\nerror rates and processing inefficiencies. This fragmented architecture created\nsignificant operational overhead and limited their ability to have a comprehensive\nview of the patient.\n\nFurther, they needed to ingest over 1 billion data points due to a changing landscape\nof customer demand such as bookings, appointments, pricing, eHealth transaction\nactivity, etc. ‚Äî estimated at over 1TB of data.\n\n‚ÄúWe had a lot of data challenges. We just couldn‚Äôt process efficiently enough. We\nwere starting to get batch overruns. We were starting to see that a 24-hour window\nisn‚Äôt the most optimum time in which we want to be able to deliver healthcare data\nand services,‚Äù explained Peter James, Chief Architect at Healthdirect Australia.\n\nUltimately, Healthdirect realized they needed to modernize their end-to-end process\nand tech stack to properly support the business.\n\n**Modernizing analytics with Databricks and Delta Lake**\nDatabricks provides Healthdirect Australia with a Unified Data Platform that simplifies\ndata engineering and accelerates data science innovation. The notebook environment\nenables them to make content changes in a controlled fashion rather than having to\nrun bespoke jobs each time.\n\n‚ÄúDatabricks has provided a big uplift for our teams and our data operations,‚Äù said\nJames. ‚ÄúThe analysts were working directly with the data operations teams. They are\nable to achieve the same pieces of work together within the same time frames that\nused to take twice as long. They‚Äôre working together, and we‚Äôre seeing just a massive\nacceleration in the speed at which we can deliver service.‚Äù\n\n\n-----\n\nWith Delta Lake, they‚Äôve created logical data zones: Landing, Raw, Staging and Gold.\nWithin these zones, they store their data ‚Äúas is,‚Äù in their structured or unstructured\nstate, in Delta Lake tables. From there, they use a metadata-driven schema and hold\nthe data within a nested structure within that table. What this allows them to do is\nhandle data consistently from every source and simplifies the mapping of data to the\nvarious applications pulling the data.\n\nMeanwhile, through Structured Streaming, they were able to convert all of their\nETL batch jobs into streaming ETL jobs that could serve multiple applications\nconsistently. Overall, the advent of Spark Structured Streaming, Delta Lake and the\nDatabricks Unified Data Platform provides significant architectural improvements\nthat have boosted performance, reduced operational overheads and increased\nprocess efficiencies.\n\n\n**Faster data pipelines result in better patient-driven**\n**healthcare**\nAs a result of the performance gains delivered by Databricks and the improved data\nreliability through Delta Lake, Healthdirect Australia realized improved accuracy of\ntheir fuzzy name match algorithm from less than 80% with manual verification to 95%\nand no manual intervention.\n\nThe processing improvements with Delta Lake and Structured Streaming allowed\nthem to process more than 30,000 automated updates per month. Prior to Databricks,\nthey had to use unreliable batch jobs that were highly manual to process the same\nnumber of updates over a span of 6 months ‚Äî a 6x improvement in data processing.\n\n‚ÄúDatabricks delivered the time to market as well as the analytics and operational\nuplift that we needed in order to be able to meet the new demands of the\nhealthcare sector.‚Äù\n\n‚Äì Peter James, Chief Architect, Healthdirect Australia\n\n\n-----\n\nThey were also able to increase their data load rate to 1 million records per minute,\nloading their entire 20 million record data set in 20 minutes. Before the adoption\nof Databricks, this used to take more than 24 hours to process the same 1 million\ntransactions, blocking analysts from making swift decisions to drive results.\n\nLast, data security, which was critical to meet compliance requirements, was greatly\nimproved. Databricks provides standard security accreditations like HIPAA, and\nHealthdirect was able to use Databricks to meet Australia‚Äôs security requirements.\nThis yielded significant cost reductions and gave them continuous data assurance\nby monitoring changes to access privileges like changes in roles, metadata-level\nsecurity changes, data leakage, etc.\n\n‚ÄúDatabricks delivered the time to market as well as the analytics and operational\nuplift that we needed in order to be able to meet the new demands of the healthcare\nsector,‚Äù said James.\n\nWith the help of Databricks, they have proven the value of data and analytics and how\nit can impact their business vision. With transparent access to data that boasts\nwell-documented lineage and quality, participation across various business and\nanalyst groups has increased ‚Äî empowering teams to collaborate and more\neasily and quickly extract value from their data with the goal of improving\nhealthcare for everyone.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Comcast**\nUses Delta Lake and MLflow to\nTransform the Viewer Experience\n\n**Spotlight on Comcast**\n**Industry:** Media and entertainment\n10x\nReduction in overall compute costs to process data\n90%\nReduction in required DevOps resources to manage infrastructure\nReduced\nDeployment times from weeks to minutes\n\nAs a global technology and media company connecting millions of customers to\npersonalized experiences, Comcast struggled with massive data, fragile data pipelines\n\nand poor data science collaboration.

To make matters more\ncomplicated, Comcast needed to deploy models to a disjointed and disparate range\nof environments: cloud, on-premises and even directly to devices in some instances.\n\n-  **Massive data:** Billions of events generated by the entertainment system and 20+\nmillion voice remotes, resulting in petabytes of data that need to be sessionized\nfor analysis.\n\n-  **Fragile pipelines:** Complicated data pipelines that frequently failed and were\nhard to recover. Small files were difficult to manage, slowing data ingestion for\ndownstream machine learning.\n\n-  **Poor collaboration:** Globally dispersed data scientists working in different\nscripting languages struggled to share and reuse code.\n\n-  **Manage management of ML models:** Developing, training and deploying hundreds\nof models was highly manual, slow and hard to replicate, making it difficult to scale.\n\n-  **Friction between dev and deployment:** Dev teams wanted to use the latest tools\nand models while ops wanted to deploy on proven infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Automated infrastructure, faster data**\n**pipelines with Delta Lake**\nComcast realized they needed to modernize their entire approach to analytics from\ndata ingest to the deployment of machine learning models to delivering new features\nthat delight their customers. Today, the Databricks Unified Data Platform enables\nComcast to build rich data sets and optimize machine learning at scale, streamline\nworkflows across teams, foster collaboration, reduce infrastructure complexity, and\ndeliver superior customer experiences.\n\n-  **Simplified infrastructure management:** Reduced operational costs through\nautomated cluster management and cost management features such as\nautoscaling and spot instances.\n\n\n\n-  **Performant data pipelines:** Delta Lake is used for the ingest, data enrichment and\ninitial processing of the raw telemetry from video and voice applications and devices.\n\n-  **Reliably manage small files:** Delta Lake enabled them to optimize files for rapid\nand reliable ingestion at scale.\n\n-  **Collaborative workspaces:** Interactive notebooks improve cross-team\ncollaboration and data science creativity, allowing Comcast to greatly accelerate\nmodel prototyping for faster iteration.\n\n-  **Simplified ML lifecycle:** Managed MLflow simplifies the machine learning lifecycle\nand model serving via the Kubeflow environment, allowing them to track and\nmanage hundreds of models with ease.\n\n-  **Reliable ETL at scale:** Delta Lake provides efficient analytics pipelines at scale\nthat can reliably join historic and streaming data for richer insights.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Delivering personalized experiences with ML**\nIn the intensely competitive entertainment industry, there is no time to press the\nPause button. Armed with a unified approach to analytics, Comcast can now fastforward into the future of AI-powered entertainment ‚Äî keeping viewers engaged and\ndelighted with competition-beating customer experiences.\n\n-  **Emmy-winning viewer experience:** Databricks helps enable Comcast to create\na highly innovative and award-winning viewer experience with intelligent voice\ncommands that boosts engagement.\n\n-  **Reduced compute costs by 10x:** Delta Lake has enabled Comcast to optimize data\ningestion, replacing 640 machines with 64 while improving performance. Teams\ncan spend more time on analytics and less time on infrastructure management.\n\n-  **Less DevOps:** Reduced the number of DevOps full-time employees required for\nonboarding 200 users from 5 to 0.5.\n\n-  **Higher data science productivity:** Fostered collaboration between global data\nscientists by enabling different programming languages through a single\ninteractive workspace. Also, Delta Lake has enabled the data team to use data at\nany point within the data pipeline, allowing them to act more quickly in building\nand training new models.\n\n-  **Faster model deployment:** Reduced deployment times from weeks to minutes as\noperations teams deployed models on disparate platforms.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Banco Hipotecario**\nPersonalizes the Banking\nExperience With Data and ML\n\nBanco Hipotecario ‚Äî a leading Argentinian commercial bank ‚Äî is on a mission\nto leverage machine learning to deliver new insights and services that will delight\ncustomers and create upsell opportunities. With a legacy analytics and data\nwarehousing system that was rigid and complex to scale, they turned to Databricks\nto unify data science, engineering and analytics.\n\nAs a result of this partnership, they were able to significantly increase customer\nacquisition and cross-sells while lowering the cost for acquisition, greatly impacting\noverall customer retention and profitability.\n\n**Spotlight on Banco Hipotecario**\n**Industry:** Financial services\n35%\n\nReduction in cost of acquisition\n**Technical use cases:** Ingest and ETL, machine learning and SQL Analytics\n\n\n-----\n\n**Legacy analytics tools are slow, rigid and**\n**impossible to scale**\nBanco Hipotecario set forth to increase customer acquisition by reducing risk and\nimproving the customer experience. With data analytics and machine learning\nanchoring their strategy, they hoped to influence a range of use cases from fraud\ndetection and risk analysis to serving product recommendations to drive upsell and\ncross-sell opportunities and forecast sales.\n\nBanco Hipotecario faced a number of the challenges that often come along with\noutdated technology and processes: disorganized or inaccurate data; poor crossteam collaboration; the inability to innovate and scale; resource-intensive workflows,\n‚Äî the list goes on.\n\n‚ÄúIn order to execute on our data analytics strategy, new technologies were needed\nin order to improve data engineering and boost data science productivity,‚Äù said\nDaniel Sanchez, Enterprise Data Architect at Banco Hipotecario. ‚ÄúThe first steps we\ntook were to move to a cloud-based data lake, which led us to Azure Databricks\nand Delta Lake.‚Äù\n\n\n-----\n\n**A unified platform powers the data lake**\n**and easy collaboration**\nBanco Hipotecario turned to Databricks to modernize their data warehouse\nenvironment, improve cross-team collaboration, and drive data science innovation.\nFully managed in Microsoft Azure, they were able to easily and reliably ingest massive\nvolumes of data, spinning up their whole infrastructure in 90 days. With Databricks‚Äô\nautomated cluster management capabilities, they are able to scale clusters ondemand to support large workloads.\n\nDelta Lake has been especially useful in bringing reliability and performance to Banco\nHipotecario‚Äôs data lake environment. With Delta Lake, they are now able to build\nreliable and performant ETL pipelines like never before.\n\n\nMeanwhile, performing SQL Analytics on Databricks has helped them do data\nexploration, cleansing and generate data sets in order to create models, enabling the\nteam to deploy their first model within the first three months, and the second model\ngenerated was rolled out in just two weeks.\n\nAt the same time, data scientists were finally able to collaborate, thanks to interactive\nnotebooks; this meant faster builds, training and deployment. And MLflow streamlined\nthe ML lifecycle and removed the overreliance on data engineering.\n\n‚ÄúDatabricks gives our data scientists the means to easily create our own experiments\nand deploy them to production in weeks, rather than months,‚Äù said Miguel Villalba,\nHead of Data Engineering and Data Science.\n\n\n-----\n\n**An efficient team maximizes customer**\n**acquisition and retention**\nSince moving to Databricks, the data team at Banco Hipotecario could not be happier,\nas Databricks has unified them across functions in an integrated fashion.\n\nThe results of data unification and markedly improved collaboration and autonomy\ncannot be overstated.

Ltd. is one of India‚Äôs fastest-growing entertainment networks\nwith 40x growth over the past decade. They offer multi-platform, multigenerational\nand multicultural brand experiences to 600+ million monthly viewers.\n\nIn order to deliver more engaging experiences for their millions of viewers, Viacom18\nmigrated from their Hadoop environment due to its inability to process data at scale\nefficiently. With Databricks, they have streamlined their infrastructure management,\nincreased data pipeline speeds and increased productivity among their data teams.\n\nToday, Viacom18 is able to deliver more relevant viewing experiences to their\nsubscribers, while identifying opportunities to optimize the business and drive\ngreater ROI.\n\n**Spotlight on Viacom18**\n**Industry:** Media and entertainment\n26%\nIncrease in operational efficiency lowers overall costs\n\n\n-----\n\n**Growth in subscribers and terabytes of viewing data**\n**push Hadoop to its limits**\nViacom18, a joint venture between Network18 and ViacomCBS, is focused on\nproviding its audiences with highly personalized viewing experiences. The core\nof this strategy requires implementing an enterprise data architecture that enables\nthe building of powerful customer analytics on daily viewer data. But with millions of\nconsumers across India, the sheer amount of data was tough to wrangle: They were\ntasked with ingesting and processing over 45,000 hours of daily content on VOOT\n(Viacom18‚Äôs on-demand video subscription platform), which easily generated 700GB\nto 1TB of data per day.\n\n‚ÄúContent is at the heart of what we do,‚Äù explained Parijat Dey, Viacom18‚Äôs Assistant\nVice President of Digital Transformation and Technology. ‚ÄúWe deliver personalized\ncontent recommendations across our audiences around the world based on\nindividual viewing history and preferences in order to increase viewership and\ncustomer loyalty.‚Äù\n\nViacom18‚Äôs data lake, which was leveraging on-premises Hadoop for operations,\nwasn‚Äôt able to optimally process 90 days of rolling data within their management‚Äôs\ndefined SLAs, limiting their ability to deliver on their analytics needs, which impacted\nnot only the customer experience but also overall costs.\n\nTo meet this challenge head-on, Viacom18 needed a modern data warehouse with the\nability to analyze data trends for a longer period of time instead of daily snapshots. They\nalso needed a platform that simplified infrastructure by allowing their team to easily\nprovision clusters with features like auto-scaling to help reduce compute costs.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Rapid data processing for analytics**\n**and ML with Databricks**\nTo enable the processing power and data science capabilities they required, Viacom18\npartnered with Celebal Technologies, a premier Salesforce, data analytics and big data\nconsulting organization based in India. The team at Celebal leveraged Azure Databricks\nto provide Viacom18 with a unified data platform that modernizes its data warehousing\ncapabilities and accelerates data processing at scale.\n\nThe ability to cache data within Delta Lake resulted in the much-needed acceleration\nof queries, while cluster management with auto-scaling and the decoupling of\n\n\nstorage and compute simplified Viacom18‚Äôs infrastructure management and\noptimized operational costs. ‚ÄúDelta Lake has created a streamlined approach to\nthe management of data pipelines,‚Äù explained Dey. ‚ÄúThis has led to a decrease in\noperational costs while speeding up time-to-insight for downstream analytics and\ndata science.‚Äù\n\nThe notebooks feature was an unexpected bonus for Viacom18, as a common workspace\ngave data teams a way to collaborate and increase productivity on everything from\nmodel training to ad hoc analysis, dashboarding and reporting via PowerBI.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Leveraging viewer data to power personalized**\n**viewing experiences**\nCelebal Technologies and Databricks have enabled Viacom18 to deliver innovative\ncustomer solutions and insights with increased cross-team collaboration and\nproductivity.

With the widespread adoption of cloud, data teams\noften invest in large-scale complex data systems that have capabilities for\nstreaming, business intelligence, analytics and machine learning to support\nthe overall business objectives.\n\nTo support these objectives, data teams have deployed cloud data\n\nwarehouses and data lakes.\n\n\nTraditional data systems: The data warehouse and data lake\n\nWith the advent of big data, companies began collecting large amounts of\ndata from many different sources, such as weblogs, sensor data and images.\nData warehouses ‚Äî which have a long history as the foundation for decision\nsupport and business intelligence applications ‚Äî cannot handle large volumes\nof data.\n\nWhile data warehouses are great for structured data and historical analysis,\nthey weren‚Äôt designed for unstructured data, semi-structured data, and data\nwith high variety, velocity and volume, making them unsuitable for many types\nof data.\n\nThis led to the introduction of data lakes, providing a single repository of raw\ndata in a variety of formats. While suitable for storing big data, data lakes do\nnot support transactions, nor do they enforce data quality, and their lack of\nconsistency/isolation makes it almost impossible to read, write or process data.\n\nFor these reasons, many of the promises of data lakes never materialized and,\nin many cases, reduced the benefits of data warehouses.\n\nAs companies discovered new use cases for data exploration, predictive modeling\nand prescriptive analytics, the need for a single, flexible, high-performance system\nonly grew. Data teams require systems for diverse data applications including SQL\nanalytics, real-time analytics, data science and machine learning.\n\n\n-----\n\nTo solve for new use cases and new users, a common approach is to use multiple\nsystems ‚Äî a data lake, several data warehouses and other specialized systems\nsuch as streaming, time-series, graph and image databases. But having multiple\nsystems introduces complexity and delay, as data teams invariably need to\nmove or copy data between different systems, effectively losing oversight and\ngovernance over data usage.\n\n\nYou have now duplicated data in two different systems and the changes you\nmake in one system are unlikely to find their way to the other. So, you are going\nto have data drift almost immediately, not to mention paying to store the same\ndata multiple times.\n\nThen, because governance is happening at two distinct levels across these\nplatforms, you are not able to control things consistently.\n\n\n**Challenges with data, analytics and AI**\n\nIn a recent [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/pdf-108/accenture-closing-data-value-gap-fixed.pdf) study, only 32% of companies reported tangible and\nmeasurable value from data. The challenge is that most companies continue to\nimplement two different platforms: data warehouses for BI and data lakes for AI.\nThese platforms are incompatible with each other, but data from both systems\nis generally needed to deliver game-changing outcomes, which makes success\nwith AI extremely difficult.\n\nToday, most of the data is landing in the data lake, and a lot of it is unstructured.\nIn fact, according to [IDC](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US47998321) , about 80% of the data in any organization will be\nunstructured by 2025. But, this data is where much of the value from AI resides.\nSubsets of the data are then copied to the data warehouse into structured\ntables, and back again in some cases.\n\nYou also must secure and govern the data in both warehouses and offer\nfine-grained governance, while lakes tend to be coarser grained at the file level.\nThen, you stand up different stacks of tools on these platforms to do either\nBI or AI.\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally, the tool stacks on top of these platforms\nare fundamentally different, which makes it difficult\nto get any kind of collaboration going between the\nteams that support them.\n\nThis is why AI efforts fail. There is a tremendous\namount of complexity and rework being introduced\ninto the system. Time and resources are being\nwasted trying to get the right data to the right\npeople, and everything is happening too slowly\nto get in front of the competition.\n\n\n**Realizing this requires two disparate,**\n**incompatible data platforms**\n\n\n**Business** **SQL** **Incomplete** **Data science** **Data**\n\n**support for**\n\n**intelligence** **analytics** **and ML** **streaming**\n\n\n**SQL**\n**analytics**\n\n\n**Incomplete**\n**support for**\n**use cases**\n\n\n**Incompatible**\n**security and**\n**governance models**\n\n**Copy subsets of data**\n\n\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Governa T|n a|c b|e and security le ACLs|\n|||||\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Governa File|n s|c a|e and security nd blobs|\n|||||\n\n\n**Disjointed**\n**and duplicative**\n\n**Data warehouse** **data silos** **Data lake**\nStructured tables Unstructured files:\nlogs, text, images, video\n\n\n-----\n\n**Moving forward with a lakehouse architecture**\n\nTo satisfy the need to support AI and BI directly on vast amounts of data stored\nin data lakes (on low-cost cloud storage), a new data management architecture\nemerged independently across many organizations and use cases: the\ndata lakehouse.\n\nThe data lakehouse can store _all_ and _any_ type of data once in a data lake and\nmake that data accessible directly for AI and BI. The lakehouse paradigm has\nspecific capabilities to efficiently allow both AI and BI on all the enterprise‚Äôs data\nat a massive scale. Namely, it has the SQL and performance capabilities such as\nindexing, caching and MPP processing to make BI work fast on data lakes. It also\nhas direct file access and direct native support for Python, data science and AI\nframeworks without the need for a separate data warehouse.\n\nIn short, a lakehouse is a data architecture that combines the best elements\nof data warehouses and data lakes. Lakehouses are enabled by a new system\ndesign, which implements similar data structures and data management features\nfound in a data warehouse directly on the low-cost storage used for data lakes.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Data lakehouse\n\nOne platform to unify all your data, analytics and AI workloads\n\n###### Lakehouse Platform\n\nAll machine learning, SQL,\nBI, and streaming use cases\n\nOne security and governance\napproach for all data assets\non all clouds\n\n\n-----\n\n**Key features for a lakehouse**\n\nRecent innovations with the data lakehouse architecture can help simplify\nyour data and AI workloads, ease collaboration for data teams, and maintain\nthe kind of flexibility and openness that allows your organization to stay agile\nas you scale. Here are key features to consider when evaluating data lakehouse\narchitectures:\n\nTransaction support: In an enterprise lakehouse, many data pipelines will\noften be reading and writing data concurrently. Support for ACID (Atomicity,\nConsistency, Isolation and Durability) transactions ensures consistency as\nmultiple parties concurrently read or write data.\n\nSchema enforcement and governance: The lakehouse should have\na way to support schema enforcement and evolution, supporting data\nwarehouse schema paradigms such as star/snowflake. The system should\nbe able to reason about data integrity, and it should have robust governance\nand auditing mechanisms.\n\nData governance: Capabilities including auditing, retention and lineage\nhave become essential, particularly considering recent privacy regulations.\n\nTools that allow data discovery have become popular, such as data catalogs\nand data usage metrics.\n\nBI support: Lakehouses allow the use of BI tools directly on the source\ndata. This reduces staleness and latency, improves recency and lowers cost\nby not having to operationalize two copies of the data in both a data lake\nand a warehouse.\n\n\nStorage decoupled from compute: In practice, this means storage and\ncompute use separate clusters, thus these systems can scale to many more\nconcurrent users and larger data sizes. Some modern data warehouses also\nhave this property.\n\nOpenness: The storage formats, such as Apache Parquet, are open and\nstandardized, so a variety of tools and engines, including machine learning\nand Python/R libraries, can efficiently access the data directly.\n\nSupport for diverse data types (unstructured and structured):\nThe lakehouse can be used to store, refine, analyze and access data types\nneeded for many new data applications, including images, video, audio,\nsemi-structured data and text.\n\nSupport for diverse workloads: Use the same data repository for a range\nof workloads including data science, machine learning and SQL analytics.\nMultiple tools might be needed to support all these workloads.\n\nEnd-to-end streaming: Real-time reports are the norm in many enterprises.\nSupport for streaming eliminates the need for separate systems dedicated to\nserving real-time data applications.\n\n**Learn more**\n\n**‚Ä¢** [Lakehouse: A New Generation of Open Platforms](http://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2021/papers/cidr2021_paper17.pdf)\n[That Unify Data Warehousing and Advanced Analytics](http://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2021/papers/cidr2021_paper17.pdf)\n\n**‚Ä¢** [Building the Data Lakehouse by Bill Inmon, Father of the](https://databricks.com/p/ebook/building-the-data-lakehouse)\n[Data Warehouse](https://databricks.com/p/ebook/building-the-data-lakehouse)\n\n**‚Ä¢** [What Is a Data Lakehouse?](https://databricks.com/glossary/data-lakehouse#:~:text=A%20data%20lakehouse%20is%20a,(ML)%20on%20all%20data.)\n\n\n-----\n\n**CHAPTER**\n\n# 02\n\n\n### The Databricks  Lakehouse Platform\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Lakehouse: A new generation of open platforms\n\n\n###### This is the lakehouse paradigm\n\n\nDatabricks is the inventor and pioneer of the\ndata lakehouse architecture. The data lakehouse\narchitecture was coined in the research paper,\n[Lakehouse: A New Generation of Open Platforms that](http://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2021/papers/cidr2021_paper17.pdf)\n[Unify Data Warehousing and Advanced Analytics](http://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2021/papers/cidr2021_paper17.pdf) ,\nintroduced by Databricks‚Äô founders, UC Berkeley\nand Stanford University at the 11th Conference on\nInnovative Data Systems Research (CIDR) in 2021.\n\nAt Databricks, we are continuously innovating on\nthe lakehouse architecture to help customers deliver\non their data, analytics and AI aspirations. The ideal\ndata, analytics and AI platform needs to operate\ndifferently. Rather than copying and transforming\ndata in multiple systems, you need one platform\nthat accommodates all data types.\n\n\n**Data science** **Data**\n**and ML** **streaming**\n\n\n**All ML, SQL, BI**\n**and streaming use cases**\n\n**One security and governance**\n**approach for all data assets**\n**on all clouds**\n\n**A reliable data platform**\n**to efficiently handle**\n**all data types**\n\n\n**Persona-based**\n**use cases**\n\n**Unity Catalog**\nFine-grained governance\nfor data and AI\n\n**Delta Lake**\nData reliability and performance\n\n\n**Business**\n**intelligence**\n\n\n**SQL**\n**analytics**\n\n\nFiles and blobs and table ACLs\n\n\nIdeally, the platform must be open, so that you\nare not locked into any walled gardens. You would\nalso have one security and governance model.\nIt would not only manage all data types, but it\nwould also be cloud-agnostic to govern data\nwherever it is stored.\n\nLast, it would support all major data, analytics and AI\nworkloads, so that your teams can easily collaborate\nand get access to all the data they need to innovate.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### What is the Databricks  Lakehouse Platform?\n\nThe Databricks Lakehouse Platform unifies your\ndata warehousing and AI uses cases on a single\nplatform. It combines the best elements of data\nlakes and data warehouses to deliver the reliability,\nstrong governance and performance of data\nwarehouses with the openness, flexibility and\nmachine learning support of data lakes.\n\nThis unified approach simplifies your modern data\nstack by eliminating the data silos that traditionally\nseparate and complicate data engineering, analytics,\nBI, data science and machine learning. It‚Äôs built\non open source and open standards to maximize\nflexibility. And, its common approach to data\nmanagement, security and governance helps you\n\noperate more efficiently and innovate faster.\n\n\n**Lakehouse Platform**\n\nData Data Data Data science\nwarehousing engineering streaming and ML\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Benefits of the Databricks Lakehouse Platform\n\n\n**Simple**\n\nThe unified approach simplifies your data\narchitecture by eliminating the data silos that\ntraditionally separate analytics, BI, data science\nand machine learning.

Delta Lake solves challenges around unstructured/structured data\ningestion, the application of data quality, difficulties with deleting data for\ncompliance or issues with modifying data for data capture.\n\nAlthough data lakes are great solutions for holding large quantities of raw\ndata, they lack important attributes for data reliability and quality and\noften don‚Äôt offer good performance when compared to data warehouses.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Problems with today‚Äôs  data lakes\n\nWhen it comes to data reliability and quality, examples of these\nmissing attributes include:\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Lack of ACID transactions:** Makes it impossible to mix updates,\nappends and reads\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Lack of schema enforcement:** Creates inconsistent and low-quality data.\nFor example, rejecting writes that don‚Äôt match a table‚Äôs schema.\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Lack of integration with data catalog:** Results in dark data and no single\nsource of truth\n\nEven just the absence of these three attributes can cause a lot of extra work\nfor data engineers as they strive to ensure consistent high-quality data in the\npipelines they create.\n\n\nThese challenges are solved with two key technologies that are at the foundation\nof the lakehouse: Delta Lake and Photon.\n\n**What is Delta Lake?**\n\nDelta Lake is a file-based, open source storage format that provides ACID\ntransactions and scalable metadata handling, and unifies streaming and batch\ndata processing. It runs on top of existing data lakes and is compatible with\nApache Spark‚Ñ¢ and other processing engines.\n\nDelta Lake uses Delta Tables which are based on Apache Parquet, a commonly\nused format for structured data already utilized by many organizations. Therefore,\nswitching existing Parquet tables to Delta Tables is easy and quick. Delta\nTables can also be used with semi-structured and unstructured data, providing\nversioning, reliability, metadata management, and time travel capabilities that\nmake these types of data easily managed as well.\n\n\nAs for performance, data lakes use object storage, so data is mostly kept in\nimmutable files leading to the following problems:\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Ineffective partitioning:** In many cases, data engineers resort to ‚Äúpoor man‚Äôs‚Äù\nindexing practices in the form of partitioning that leads to hundreds of dev hours\nspent tuning file sizes to improve read/write performance. Often, partitioning\nproves to be ineffective over time if the wrong field was selected for partitioning\nor due to high cardinality columns.\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Too many small files:** With no support for transactions, appending new data\ntakes the form of adding more and more files, leading to ‚Äúsmall file problems,‚Äù\na known root cause of query performance degradation.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Delta Lake features**\n\n\n**ACID guarantees**\n\nDelta Lake ensures that all data changes\nwritten to storage are committed for durability\nand made visible to readers atomically. In other\nwords, no more partial or corrupted files.\n\n**Scalable data and metadata handling**\n\nSince Delta Lake is built on data lakes, all reads\nand writes using Spark or other distributed\nprocessing engines are inherently scalable to\npetabyte-scale. However, unlike most other\nstorage formats and query engines, Delta Lake\nleverages Spark to scale out all the metadata\nprocessing, thus efficiently handling metadata\nof billions of files for petabyte-scale tables.\n\n\n**Audit history and time travel**\n\nThe Delta Lake transaction log records details\nabout every change made to data, providing a full\naudit trail of the changes. These data snapshots\nallow developers to access and revert to earlier\nversions of data for audits, rollbacks or to\nreproduce experiments.\n\n**Schema enforcement and schema evolution**\n\nDelta Lake automatically prevents the insertion of\ndata with an incorrect schema, i.e., not matching\nthe table schema. And when needed, it allows the\ntable schema to be explicitly and safely evolved to\naccommodate ever-changing data.\n\n\n**Support for deletes, updates and merges**\n\nMost distributed processing frameworks do not\nsupport atomic data modification operations on\ndata lakes. Delta Lake supports merge, update\nand delete operations to enable complex use\ncases including but not limited to change data\ncapture (CDC), slowly changing dimension (SCD)\noperations and streaming upserts.\n\n**Streaming and batch unification**\n\nA Delta Lake table can work both in batch\nand as a streaming source and sink. The\nability to work across a wide variety of latencies,\nranging from streaming data ingestion to batch\nhistoric backfill, to interactive queries all work\nout of the box.\n\n\n-----\n\n**The Delta Lake transaction log**\n\nA key to understanding how Delta Lake provides all these capabilities is the\ntransaction log. The Delta Lake transaction log is the common thread that runs\nthrough many of Delta Lake‚Äôs most notable features, including ACID transactions,\nscalable metadata handling, time travel and more. The Delta Lake transaction log\nis an ordered record of every transaction that has ever been performed on\na Delta Lake table since its inception.\n\nDelta Lake is built on top of Spark to allow multiple readers and writers of a\ngiven table to work on a table at the same time. To always show users correct\nviews of the data, the transaction log serves as a single source of truth: the\ncentral repository that tracks all changes that users make to the table.\n\nWhen a user reads a Delta Lake table for the first time or runs a new query on\nan open table that has been modified since the last time it was read, Spark\nchecks the transaction log to see what new transactions are posted to the table.\nThen, Spark updates the table with those recent changes. This ensures that a\nuser‚Äôs version of a table is always synchronized with the master record as of the\nmost recent query, and that users cannot make divergent, conflicting changes\nto a table.\n\n\n**Flexibility and broad industry support**\n\nDelta Lake is an open source project, with an engaged community of\ncontributors building and growing the Delta Lake ecosystem atop a set of open\nAPIs and is part of the Linux Foundation. With the growing adoption of Delta Lake\nas an open storage standard in different environments and use cases, comes a\nbroad set of integration with industry-leading tools, technologies and formats.\n\nOrganizations leveraging Delta Lake on the Databricks Lakehouse Platform gain\nflexibility in how they ingest, store and query data. They are not limited in storing\ndata in a single cloud provider and can implement a true multicloud approach to\ndata storage.\n\nConnectors to tools, such as Fivetran, allow you to leverage Databricks‚Äô\necosystem of partner solutions, so organizations have full control of building the\nright ingestion pipelines for their use cases. Finally, consuming data via queries\nfor exploration or business intelligence (BI) is also flexible and open.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Delta Lake integrates with all major analytics tools**\n\nEliminates unnecessary data movement and duplication\n\n\n-----\n\nIn addition to a wide ecosystem of tools and technologies, Delta Lake supports\na broad set of data formats for structured, semi-structured and unstructured\ndata. These formats include image binary data that can be stored in Delta\nTables, graph data format, geospatial data types and key-value stores.\n\n**Learn more**\n\n[Delta Lake on the Databricks Lakehouse](https://databricks.com/product/delta-lake-on-databricks)\n\n[Documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/delta/index.html)\n\n[Delta Lake Open Source Project](https://docs.databricks.com/delta/index.html)\n\n[eBooks: The Delta Lake Series](https://databricks.com/p/ebook/the-definitive-guide-to-delta-lake-series)\n\n\n**What is Photon?**\n\nAs many organizations standardize on the lakehouse paradigm, this new\narchitecture poses challenges with the underlying query execution engine\nfor accessing and processing structured and unstructured data.

At the same time, organizations also understand the risks\nof data breaches which negatively impact brand value and inevitably lead to\nerosion of customer trust. Governance is one of the most critical components\nof a lakehouse data platform architecture; it helps ensure that data assets\nare securely managed throughout the enterprise. However, many companies\nare using different incompatible governance models leading to complex and\nexpensive solutions.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Key challenges with  data and AI governance\n\n**Diversity of data and AI assets**\n\nThe increased use of data and the added complexity of the data landscape\nhave left organizations with a difficult time managing and governing all types\nof their data-related assets. No longer is data stored in files or tables. Data\nassets today take many forms, including dashboards, machine learning models\nand unstructured data like video and images that legacy data governance\nsolutions simply are not built to govern and manage.\n\n\n**Rising multicloud adoption**\n\nMore and more organizations now leverage a multicloud strategy to optimize\ncosts, avoid vendor lock-in, and meet compliance and privacy regulations. With\nnonstandard, cloud-specific governance models, data governance across clouds\nis complex and requires familiarity with cloud-specific security and governance\nconcepts, such as identity and access management (IAM).\n\n**Disjointed tools for data governance on the lakehouse**\n\nToday, data teams must deal with a myriad of fragmented tools and services for\ntheir data governance requirements, such as data discovery, cataloging, auditing,\nsharing, access controls, etc. This inevitably leads to operational inefficiencies\nand poor performance due to multiple integration points and network latency\nbetween the services.\n\n\n**Two disparate and incompatible data platforms**\n\nOrganizations today use two different platforms for their data analytics and\nAI efforts ‚Äî data warehouses for BI and data lakes for AI. This results in data\nreplication across two platforms, presenting a major governance challenge.\nWith no unified view of the data landscape, it is difficult to see where data is\nstored, who has access to what data, and consistently define and enforce data\naccess policies across the two platforms with different governance models.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### One security and  governance approach\n\nLakehouse systems provide a uniform way to manage access control, data\nquality and compliance across all of an organization‚Äôs data using standard\ninterfaces similar to those in data warehouses by adding a management\ninterface on top of data lake storage.\n\nModern lakehouse systems support fine-grained (row, column and view level)\naccess control via SQL, query auditing, attribute-based access control, data\nversioning and data quality constraints and monitoring. These features are\ngenerally provided using standard interfaces familiar to database administrators\n(for example, SQL GRANT commands) to allow existing personnel to manage\nall the data in an organization in a uniform way. Centralizing all the data in\na lakehouse system with a single management interface also reduces the\nadministrative burden and potential for error that comes with managing\nmultiple separate systems.\n\n\n#### What is Unity Catalog?\n\nUnity Catalog is a unified governance solution for all data, analytics and AI\nassets including files, tables, dashboards and machine learning models in your\nlakehouse on any cloud. Unity Catalog simplifies governance by empowering\ndata teams with a common governance model based on ANSI-SQL to define\nand enforce fine-grained access controls. With attribute-based access controls,\ndata administrators can enable fine-grained access controls on rows and\ncolumns using tags (attributes). Built-in data search and discovery allows\ndata teams to quickly find and reference relevant data for any use case. Unity\nCatalog offers automated data lineage for all workloads in SQL, R, Scala and\nPython, to build a better understanding of the data and its flow in the lakehouse.\nUnity Catalog also allows data sharing across or within organizations and\nseamless integrations with your existing data governance tools.\n\nWith Unity Catalog, data teams can simplify governance for all data and AI\nassets with one consistent model to discover, access and share data, giving\nyou much better native performance, management and security across clouds.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Key benefits**\n\n\nThe common metadata layer for cross-workspace metadata is at the account\nlevel and eases collaboration by allowing different workspaces to access Unity\nCatalog metadata through a common interface and break down data silos.\nFurther, the data permissions in Unity Catalog are applied to account-level\nidentities, rather than identities that are local to a workspace, allowing\na consistent view of users and groups across all workspaces.\n\n\nCatalog, secure and audit access to all data assets on any cloud\n\nUnity Catalog provides centralized metadata, enabling data teams to create\na single source of truth for all data assets ranging from files, tables, dashboards\nto machine learning models in one place.\n\n\n-----\n\nUnity Catalog offers a unified data access layer that provides a simple and\nstreamlined way to define and connect to your data through managed tables,\nexternal tables, or files, while managing their access controls. Unity Catalog\ncentralizes access controls for files, tables and views.\n\nIt allows fine-grained access controls for restricting access to certain rows\nand columns to the users and groups who are authorized to query them. With\nAttribute-Based Access Controls (ABAC), you can control access to multiple\ndata items at once based on user and data attributes, further simplifying\ngovernance at scale. For example, you will be able to tag multiple columns\nas personally identifiable information (PII) and manage access to all columns\ntagged as PII in a single rule.\n\nToday, organizations are dealing with an increased burden of regulatory\ncompliance, and data access auditing is a critical component to ensure your\norganization is set up for success while meeting compliance requirements.\nUnity Catalog also provides centralized fine-grained auditing by capturing an\naudit log of operations such as create, read, update and delete (CRUD) that have\nbeen performed against the data. This allows a fine-grained audit trail showing\nwho accessed a given data set and helps you meet your compliance and\nbusiness requirements.\n\n\n-----\n\nBuilt-in data search and discovery\n\nData discovery is a critical component to break\ndown data silos and democratize data across\nyour organization to make data-driven decisions.\nUnity Catalog provides a rich user interface for\ndata search and discovery, enabling data teams to\nquickly search relevant data assets across the data\nlandscape and reference them for all use cases ‚Äî\nBI, analytics and machine learning ‚Äî accelerating\ntime-to-value and boosting productivity.\n\n\n-----\n\nAutomated data lineage for all workloads\n\nData lineage describes the transformations and\nrefinements of data from source to insight. Lineage\nincludes capturing all the relevant metadata and\nevents associated with the data in its lifecycle,\nincluding the source of the data set, what other\ndata sets were used to create it, who created it and\nwhen, what transformations were performed, which\nother data sets leverage it, and many other events\nand attributes. Unity Catalog offers automated data\nlineage down to table and column level, enabling\ndata teams to get an end-to-end view of where\ndata is coming from, what transformations were\nperformed on the data and how data is consumed\nby end applications such as notebooks, workflows,\ndashboards, machine learning models, etc.\n\nWith automated data lineage for all workloads ‚Äî\nSQL, R, Python and Scala, data teams can quickly\nidentify and perform root cause analysis of any\nerrors in the data pipelines or end applications.\nSecond, data teams can perform impact analysis\nto see dependencies of any data changes\non downstream consumers and notify them\nabout the potential impact. Finally, data lineage\nalso empowers data teams with increased\nunderstanding of their data and reduces tribal\nknowledge. Unity Catalog can also capture lineage\nassociated with non-data entities, such as notebooks,\nworkflows and dashboards. Lineage can be\n\n\n_Data lineage with Unity Catalog_\n\nretrieved via REST APIs to support integrations\nwith other catalogs.\n\nIntegrated with your existing tools\n\n\n**Resources**\n\n[Learn more about Unity Catalog](https://databricks.com/product/unity-catalog)\n\n[AWS Documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/index.html)\n\n[Azure Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/data-governance/unity-catalog/)\n\n\nUnity Catalog helps you to future-proof your data\nand AI governance with the flexibility to leverage\nyour existing data catalogs and governance\nsolutions ‚Äî Collibra, Alation, Immuta, Privacera,\nMicrosoft Purview and AWS Lakeformation.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Open data sharing  and collaboration\n\nData sharing has become important in the digital\neconomy as enterprises wish to exchange data\neasily and securely with their customers, partners,\nsuppliers and internal lines of business to better\ncollaborate and unlock value from that data. But\nto date, a lack of standards-based data sharing\nprotocol has resulted in data sharing solutions\ntied to a single vendor or commercial product,\nintroducing vendor lock-in risks. What the industry\ndeserves is an open approach to data sharing.\n\n**Why data sharing is hard**\n\nData sharing has evolved from an optional feature\nof a few data platforms to a business necessity\nand success factor for organizations. Our solution\narchitects encounter daily the classic scenarios\nof a retailer looking to publish sales data to their\nsuppliers in real time or a supplier that wants to\nshare real-time inventory.\n\nAs a reminder, data sharing recently triggered\nthe most impressive scientific development that\nhumankind has ever seen. On January 5, 2021, the\nfirst sample of the genome of the coronavirus was\n\n\nuploaded to the internet. It wasn‚Äôt a lung biopsy\nfrom a patient in Wuhan, but a shared digital\ngenomic data set that triggered the development\nof the first batch of COVID vaccines worldwide.\n\n\ntreatments, tests and tracking mutations as they\nare passed down through a lineage, a branch of\nthe coronavirus family tree. The above graphic\nshows such a [publicly shared mutation data set](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) .\n\n\nSince then, coronavirus experts have daily\nexchanged public data sets, looking for better\n\n\n-----\n\nSharing data, as well as consuming data from\nexternal sources, allows you to collaborate with\npartners, establish new partnerships, enable\nresearch and can generate new revenue streams\nwith data monetization.\n\nDespite those promising examples, existing data\nsharing technologies come with several limitations:\n\n**‚Ä¢** Traditional data sharing technologies, such as\nSecure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), do not\nscale well and only serve files offloaded to a\nserver\n\n**‚Ä¢** Cloud object stores operate on an object level\nand are cloud-specific\n\n**‚Ä¢** Commercial data sharing offerings baked into\nvendor products often share tables instead of\nfiles, but scaling them is expensive and they\nare not open and, therefore, do not permit data\nsharing with a different platform\n\nThe following table compares proprietary vendor\nsolutions with SFTP, cloud object stores and Delta\nSharing.\n\n\n\n|Col1|Proprietary vendor solutions|SFTP|Cloud object store|Delta Sharing|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Secure|||||\n|Cheap|||||\n|Vendor agnostic|||||\n|Multicloud|||||\n|Open source|||||\n|Table/DataFrame abstraction|||||\n|Live data|||||\n|Predicate pushdown|||||\n|Object store bandwidth|||||\n|Zero compute cost|||||\n|Scalability|||||\n\n\n-----\n\n**Open source data sharing and Databricks**\n\nTo address the limitations of existing data sharing solutions, Databricks developed\n[Delta Sharing](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-sharing) , with various contributions from the OSS community, and donated it\nto the Linux Foundation.\n\nAn open source‚Äìbased solution, such as Delta Sharing, eliminates the lock-in\nof commercial solutions and brings a number of additional benefits such as\ncommunity-developed integrations with popular, open source data processing\nframeworks. In addition, open protocols allow the easy integration of commercial\nclients, such as BI tools.\n\n**What is Databricks Delta Sharing?**\n\nDatabricks Delta Sharing provides an open solution to securely share live data\nfrom your lakehouse to any computing platform. Recipients don‚Äôt have to be\non the Databricks platform or on the same cloud or a cloud at all. Data providers\ncan share live data, without replicating or moving it to another system. Recipients\nbenefit from always having access to the latest version of data and can quickly\nquery shared data using tools of their choice for BI, analytics and machine\nlearning, reducing time-to-value. Data providers can centrally manage, govern,\naudit and track usage of the shared data on one platform.\n\nUnity Catalog natively supports [Delta Sharing](https://databricks.com/product/delta-sharing) , the world‚Äôs first open protocol\nfor data sharing, enabling organizations to share live, large-scale data without\nreplication and make data easily and quickly accessible from tools of your\nchoice, with enterprise-grade security.\n\n\n**Key benefits**\n\nOpen cross-platform sharing\n\nEasily share existing data in Delta Lake and Apache Parquet formats between\ndifferent vendors. Consumers don‚Äôt have to be on the Databricks platform, same\ncloud or a cloud at all. Native integration with Power BI, Tableau, Spark, pandas\nand Java allow recipients to consume shared data directly from the tools of their\nchoice. Delta Sharing eliminates the need to set up a new ingestion process to\nconsume data. Data recipients can directly access the fresh data and query it\nusing tools of their choice. Recipients can also enrich data with data sets from\npopular data providers.\n\nSharing live data without copying it\n\nShare live ready-to-query data, without replicating or moving it to another system.\nMost enterprise data today is stored in cloud data lakes. Any of the existing data\nsets on the provider‚Äôs data lake can easily be shared across clouds, regions or\ndata platforms without any data replication or physical movement of data. Data\nproviders can update their data sets reliably in real time and provide a fresh and\nconsistent view of their data to recipients.\n\nCentralized administration and governance\n\nYou can centrally govern, track and audit access to the shared data from a single\npoint of enforcement to meet compliance requirements. Detailed user-access\naudit logs are kept to know who is accessing the data and monitor usage of the\nshared data down to table, partition and version level.\n\n\n-----\n\nAn open Marketplace for data solutions\n\nThe demand for third-party data to make data-driven innovations is greater than ever,\n\nand data marketplaces act as a bridge between data providers and data consumers to\n\nhelp facilitate the discovery and distribution of data sets.\n\nDatabricks Marketplace provides an open marketplace for exchanging data products\n\nsuch as data sets, notebooks, dashboards and machine learning models. To accelerate\n\ninsights, data consumers can discover, evaluate and access more data products from\n\nthird-party vendors than ever before. Providers can now commercialize new offerings\n\nand shorten sales cycles by providing value-added services on top of their data.\n\nDatabricks Marketplace is powered by Delta Sharing, allowing consumers to access\n\ndata products without having to be on the Databricks platform. This open approach\n\nallows data providers to broaden their addressable market without forcing consumers\n\ninto vendor lock-in.\n\n_Databricks Marketplace_\n\n\nPrivacy-safe data cleanrooms\n\nPowered by open source Delta Sharing, the Databricks Lakehouse Platform provides\n\na flexible data cleanroom solution allowing businesses to easily collaborate with their\n\ncustomers and partners on any cloud in a privacy-safe way. Participants in the data\n\ncleanrooms can share and join their existing data, and run complex workloads in any\n\nlanguage ‚Äî Python, R, SQL, Java and Scala ‚Äî on the data while maintaining data\n\nprivacy. Additionally, data cleanroom participants don‚Äôt have to do cost-intensive\n\ndata replication across clouds or regions with other participants, which simplifies data\n\noperations and reduces cost.\n\n_Data cleanrooms with Databricks Lakehouse Platform_\n\n\n-----\n\n**How it works**\n\nDelta Sharing is designed to be simple, scalable, non-proprietary and cost-effective for organizations that are serious about getting more from their data. Delta Sharing\nis natively integrated with Unity Catalog, which allows customers to add fine-grained governance and security controls, making it easy and safe to share data internally\nor externally.\n\nDelta Sharing is a simple REST protocol that securely shares access to part of a cloud data set. It leverages modern cloud storage systems ‚Äî such as AWS S3,\nAzure ADLS or Google‚Äôs GCS ‚Äî to reliably transfer large data sets. Here‚Äôs how it works for data providers and data recipients.\n\n**Data provider** **Data recipient**\n\nData science And many more On-premises\n\nThe data provider shares existing tables or parts thereof (such as specific table versions or partitions) stored on the cloud data lake in Delta Lake format. The provider\ndecides what data they want to share and runs a sharing server in front of it that implements the Delta Sharing protocol and manages access for recipients. To manage\nshares and recipients, you can use SQL commands or the Unity Catalog CLI or the intuitive user interface.\n\nThe data recipient only needs one of the many Delta Sharing clients that supports the protocol. Databricks has released open source connectors for pandas, Apache\nSpark, Java and Python, and is working with partners on many more.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Delta Sharing data exchange follows three efficient steps:\n\n1. The recipient‚Äôs client authenticates to the sharing server and asks to query\na specific table. The client can also provide filters on the data (for example,\n‚Äúcountry=US‚Äù) as a hint to read just a subset of the data.\n\n2. The server verifies whether the client is allowed to access the data, logs the\nrequest, and then determines which data to send back. This will be a subset\nof the data objects in cloud storage systems that make up the table.\n\n3. To transfer the data, the server generates short-lived presigned URLs that\nallow the client to read these Parquet files directly from the cloud provider,\nso that the transfer can happen in parallel at massive bandwidth, without\nstreaming through the sharing server.\n\n**Learn more**\n\n[Try Delta Sharing](https://databricks.com/product/delta-sharing)\n\n[Delta Sharing Demo](https://youtu.be/wRT1Vpbyy88)\n\n[Introducing Delta Sharing: An Open Protocol for Secure Data Sharing](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/06/28/introducing-data-cleanrooms-for-the-lakehouse.html)\n\n[Introducing Data Cleanrooms for the Lakehouse](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/06/28/introducing-data-cleanrooms-for-the-lakehouse.html)\n\n[Introducing Databricks Marketplace](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/06/28/introducing-data-cleanrooms-for-the-lakehouse.html)\n\n[Delta Sharing ODSC Webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrNHtaWlkM8)\n\n\n-----\n\n**CHAPTER**\n\n# 05\n\n\n### Security\n\nOrganizations that operate in multicloud environments need a unified, reliable\nand consistent approach to secure data. We‚Äôve learned from our customers that\na simple and unified approach to data security for the lakehouse is one of the\nmost critical requirements for modern data solutions. Databricks is trusted by\nthe world‚Äôs largest organizations to provide a powerful lakehouse platform with\nhigh security and scalability. In fact, thousands of customers trust Databricks\nwith their most sensitive data to analyze and build data products using machine\nlearning (ML). With significant investment in building a highly secure and scalable\nplatform, Databricks delivers end-to-end platform security for data and users.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Platform architecture  reduces risk\n\nThe Databricks Lakehouse architecture is split into\ntwo separate planes to simplify your permissions,\navoid data duplication and reduce risk. The control\nplane is the management plane where Databricks\nruns the workspace application and manages\nnotebooks, configuration and clusters. Unless you\nchoose to use [serverless compute](https://docs.databricks.com/serverless-compute/index.html) , the data plane\nruns inside your cloud service provider account,\nprocessing your data without taking it out of your\naccount. You can embed Databricks in your data\nexfiltration protection architecture using features\nlike customer-managed VPCs/VNets and admin\nconsole options that disable export.\n\nWhile certain data, such as your notebooks,\nconfigurations, logs, and user information, is\npresent within the control plane, that information\nis encrypted at rest, and communication to and\nfrom the control plane is encrypted in transit.\n\n\n\n**Users**\n\n**Interactive**\n**users**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|Col1|Control pane|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n||Web application Configurations Notebooks, repos, DBSQL|Cluster Cluste Your cloud s Your cloud s|\n||Cluster manager||\n\n\nYou also have choices for where certain data lives:\nYou can host your own store of metadata about\nyour data tables (Hive metastore), or store query\n\n\n**Data**\n\n\n**DBFS root**\n\n\nresults in your cloud service provider account and\ndecide whether to use the [Databricks Secrets API.](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/secrets.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Step-by-step example\n\n\n\n**Users**\n\n**Interactive**\n**users**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**DBFS root**\n\n|Col1|ample|Col3|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n||Control pane 1 4||||\n|||Web application Configurations Notebooks, repos, DBSQL Cluster manager|6|Cluster Cluste YYoouurr cclloouudd s|\n||||||\n||||||\n||||||\n||||||\n||||||\n\n\n-----\n\nSuppose you have a data engineer that signs in to Databricks and\nwrites a notebook that transforms raw data in Kafka to a normalized\ndata set sent to storage such as Amazon S3 or Azure Data Lake\nStorage. Six steps make that happen:\n\n1. The data engineer seamlessly authenticates, via your single sign-on\nif desired, to the Databricks web UI in the control plane, hosted in\nthe Databricks account.\n\n2. As the data engineer writes code, their web browser sends it to\nthe control plane. JDBC/ODBC requests also follow the same path,\nauthenticating with a token.\n\n3. When ready, the control plane uses Cloud Service Provider APIs to\ncreate a Databricks cluster, made of new instances in the data plane,\nin your CSP account. Administrators can apply cluster policies to\nenforce security profiles.\n\n4. Once the instances launch, the cluster manager sends the data\nengineer‚Äôs code to the cluster.\n\n5. The cluster pulls from Kafka in your account, transforms the data\nin your account and writes it to a storage in your account.\n\n6. The cluster reports status and any outputs back to the cluster manager.\n\nThe data engineer does not need to worry about many of the details ‚Äî\nsimply write the code and Databricks runs it.\n\n\n#### Network and server security\n\nHere is how Databricks interacts with your cloud service provider\naccount to manage network and server security\n\n**Networking**\n\nRegardless of where you choose to host the data plane, Databricks networking\nis straightforward. If you host it yourself, Databricks by default will still configure\nnetworking for you, but you can also control data plane networking with your\nown managed VPC or VNet.\n\nThe serverless data plane network infrastructure is managed by Databricks in\na Databricks cloud service provider account and shared among customers,\nwith additional network boundaries between workspaces and between clusters.\n\nDatabricks does not rewrite or change your data structure in your storage, nor\ndoes it change or modify any of your security and governance policies. Local\nfirewalls complement security groups and subnet firewall policies to block\nunexpected inbound connections.\n\nCustomers at the enterprise tier can also use the IP access list feature on\nthe control plane to limit which IP addresses can connect to the web UI or\nREST API ‚Äî for example, to allow only VPN or office IPs.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Servers**\n\nIn the data plane, Databricks clusters automatically run the latest hardened\nsystem image. Users cannot choose older (less secure) images or code. For AWS\nand Azure deployments, images are typically updated every two-to-four weeks.\nGCP is responsible for its system image.\n\nDatabricks runs scans for every release, including:\n\n**‚Ä¢** System image scanning for vulnerabilities\n\n**‚Ä¢** Container OS and library scanning\n\n\n**Severity** **Remediation time**\n\n**Critical** **< 14 days**\n\n**High** **< 30 days**\n\n**Medium** **< 60 days**\n\n**Low** **When appropriate**\n\n\n\n**‚Ä¢** Static and dynamic code scanning\n\n**Databricks access**\n\n\nDatabricks code is peer reviewed by developers who have security training.\nSignificant design documents go through comprehensive security reviews.\nScans run fully authenticated, with all checks enabled, and issues are\ntracked against the timeline shown in this table.\n\nNote that Databricks clusters are typically short-lived (often terminated\nafter a job completes) and do not persist data after they terminate. Clusters\ntypically share the same permission level (excluding high concurrency or\nDatabricks SQL clusters, where more robust security controls are in place).\nYour code is launched in an unprivileged container to maintain system\nstability. This security design provides protection against persistent attackers\nand privilege escalation.\n\n\nDatabricks access to your environment is limited to cloud service provider APIs\nfor our automation and support access. Automated access allows the Databricks\ncontrol plane to configure resources in your environment using the cloud service\nprovider APIs. The specific APIs vary based on the cloud. For instance, an AWS\ncross-account IAM role, or Azure-owned automation or GKE automation do not\ngrant access to your data sets (see the next section).\n\nDatabricks has a custom-built system that allows staff to fix issues or handle\nsupport requests ‚Äî for example, when you open a support request and check the\nbox authorizing access to your workspace. Access requires either a support ticket\nor engineering ticket tied expressly to your workspace and is limited to a subset of\nemployees and for limited time periods. Additionally, if you have configured audit\nlog delivery, the audit logs show the initial access event and the staff‚Äôs actions.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Identity and access**\n\nDatabricks supports robust ACLs and SCIM. AWS customers can configure\nSAML 2.0 and block non-SSO logins. Azure Databricks and Databricks on\nGCP automatically integrate with Azure Active Directory or GCP identity.\n\nDatabricks supports a variety of ways to enable users to access their data.\n\n**Examples include:**\n\n**‚Ä¢** The Table ACLs feature uses traditional SQL-based statements to\nmanage access to data and enable fine-grained view-based access\n\n**‚Ä¢** IAM instance profiles enable AWS clusters to assume an IAM role, so\nusers of that cluster automatically access allowed resources without\nexplicit credentials\n\n**‚Ä¢** External storage can be mounted or accessed using a securely\nstored access key\n\n**‚Ä¢** The Secrets API separates credentials from code when accessing\nexternal resources\n\n\n**Data security**\n\nDatabricks provides encryption, isolation and auditing.\n\n**Databricks encryption capabilities are**\n**in place both at rest and in motion**\n\n\n\n|For data-at-rest encryption: ‚Ä¢ Control plane is encrypted ‚Ä¢ Data plane supports local encryption ‚Ä¢ Customers can use encrypted storage buckets ‚Ä¢ Customers at some tiers can confgi ure customer-managed keys for managed services|For data-in-motion encryption: ‚Ä¢ Control plane <-> data plane is encrypted ‚Ä¢ Offers optional intra-cluster encryption ‚Ä¢ Customer code can be written to avoid unencrypted services (e.g., FTP)|\n|---|---|\n\n\n**Customers can isolate users at multiple levels:**\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Workspace level:** Each team or department can use a separate workspace\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Cluster level:** Cluster ACLs can restrict the users who can attach notebooks\n\nto a given cluster\n\n**‚Ä¢** **High concurrency clusters:** Process isolation, JVM whitelisting and limited\nlanguages (SQL, Python) allow for the safe coexistence of users of different\nprivilege levels, and is used with Table ACLs\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Single-user cluster:** Users can create a private dedicated cluster\n\nActivities of Databricks users are logged and can be delivered automatically to\na cloud storage bucket.

And finally, you save on cost\nbecause you do not need to overprovision or pay for the idle capacity.\n\n\n#### What is serverless compute?\n\nServerless compute is a fully managed service where Databricks provisions\nand manages the compute layer on behalf of the customer in the Databricks\ncloud account instead of the customer account. As of the current release,\nserverless compute is supported for use with Databricks SQL. This new\ncapability for Databricks SQL provides instant compute to users for their\nBI and SQL workloads, with minimal management required and capacity\noptimizations that can lower overall cost by 20%-40% on average. This\nmakes it even easier for organizations to expand adoption of the lakehouse\nfor business analysts who are looking to access the rich, real-time data sets\nof the lakehouse with a simple and performant solution.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Inside Serverless SQL**\n\n\n**Databricks Serverless SQL**\n\n**Managed servers**\n\n**Serverless SQL**\n**compute**\n\n**Secure**\n**Instant compute**\n\n\nAt the core of Serverless SQL is a compute\nplatform that operates a pool of servers located\nin a Databricks‚Äô account, running Kubernetes\ncontainers that can be assigned to a user\nwithin seconds.\n\nWhen many users are running reports or queries\nat the same time, the compute platform adds more\nservers to the cluster (again, within seconds) to\nhandle the concurrent load. Databricks manages\nthe entire configuration of the server and\nautomatically performs the patching and upgrades\nas needed.\n\nEach server is running a secure configuration and\nall processing is secured by three layers of isolation:\nThe Kubernetes container hosting the runtime; the\nvirtual machine (VM) hosting the container; and\nthe virtual network for the workspace. Each layer\nis isolated to one workspace with no sharing or\ncross-network traffic allowed. The containers use\nhardened configurations, VMs are shut down and\nnot reused, and network traffic is restricted\nto nodes in the same cluster.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Performance of Serverless SQL\n\nWe ran a set of internal tests to compare\nDatabricks Serverless SQL to the current\nDatabricks SQL and several traditional cloud\ndata warehouses. We found Serverless SQL\nto be the most cost-efficient and performant\nenvironment to run SQL workloads when\nconsidering cluster startup time, query\nexecution time and overall cost.\n\n\n**Databricks Serverless SQL is the highest**\n**performing and most cost-effective solution**\n\n**Cloud SQL solutions compared**\n\n\n**Faster**\n\n**Query**\n**execution**\n**time**\n\n**Slower**\n\n\n**Serverless**\n**SQL**\n\n**CDW1**\n\n**CDW3**\n\n\n**Cost Estimate**\n\n**High**\n\n**Medium**\n\n**Low**\n\n\n**CDW2**\n\n\n**CDW4**\n\n\n**Slower** **Faster**\n**(~5min)** **Startup time** **(~2-3sec)**\n\n**Learn more**\n\nThe feature is currently in Public Preview.

The explosion of\nlanguages other than SQL and unstructured data, machine learning, IoT and\nstreaming analytics are forcing organizations to adopt a bifurcated architecture\nof disjointed systems: Data warehouses for BI and data lakes for ML. While SQL\nis ubiquitous and known by millions of professionals, it has never been treated\nas a first-class citizen on data lakes, until the lakehouse.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### What is data warehousing\n\nThe Databricks Lakehouse Platform provides a simplified multicloud and\nserverless architecture for your data warehousing workloads. Data warehousing on\nthe lakehouse allows SQL analytics and BI at scale with a common governance\nmodel. Now you can ingest, transform and query all your data in-place ‚Äî using\nyour SQL and BI tools of choice ‚Äî to deliver real-time business insights at the\nbest price/performance. Built on open standards and APIs, the lakehouse\nprovides the reliability, quality and performance that data lakes natively lack,\nand integrations with the ecosystem for maximum flexibility ‚Äî no lock-in.\n\nWith data warehousing on the lakehouse, organizations can unify all analytics\nand simplify their architecture to enable their business with real-time business\ninsights at the best price/performance.\n\n\n#### Key benefits\n\n**Best price/performance**\n\nLower costs, get the best price/performance and eliminate\nresource management overhead\n\nOn-premises data warehouses have reached their limits ‚Äî they physically\ncannot scale to handle the growing volumes of data, and don‚Äôt provide the\nelasticity customers need to respond to ever-changing business needs.\nCloud data warehouses are a great alternative to on-premises data\nwarehouses, providing greater scale and elasticity, but cloud costs for\nproprietary cloud data warehouses typically yield to an exponential cost\nincrease following the growth of data volume.\n\nThe Databricks Lakehouse Platform provides instant, elastic SQL serverless\ncompute ‚Äî decoupled from storage on cheap cloud object stores ‚Äî and\nthousands of performance optimizations that can lower overall infrastructure\ncosts by [an average of 40%](https://databricks.com/blog/2021/08/30/announcing-databricks-serverless-sql.html) . Databricks automatically determines instance\ntypes and configuration for the best price/performance ‚Äî [up to 12x better](https://databricks.com/blog/2021/11/02/databricks-sets-official-data-warehousing-performance-record.html)\n[than traditional cloud data warehouses](https://databricks.com/blog/2021/11/02/databricks-sets-official-data-warehousing-performance-record.html) ‚Äî and scale for high concurrency\nuse cases.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Built-in governance**\n\nOne source of truth and one unified\ngovernance layer across all data teams\n\nUnderpinned by Delta Lake, the Databricks\nLakehouse Platform simplifies your architecture by\nallowing you to establish one single copy of all your\ndata for in-place analytics and ETL/ELT on your\nexisting data lakes ‚Äî no more data movements\nand copies in disjointed systems. Then, seamless\nintegration with Databricks Unity Catalog lets you\neasily discover, secure and manage all your data\nwith fine-grained governance, data lineage, and\nstandard SQL.\n\n**Rich ecosystem**\n\nIngest, transform and query all your\ndata in-place with your favorite tools\n\nVery few tools exist to conduct BI on data lakes.\nGenerally, doing so has required data analysts to\n\nsubmit Spark jobs or use a developer interface.\nWhile these tools are common for data scientists,\nthey require knowledge of languages and\ninterfaces that are not traditionally part of a data\nanalyst‚Äôs tool set. As a result, the learning curve for\nan analyst to make use of a data lake is too high\nwhen well-established tools and methods already\nexist for data warehouses.\n\n\nThe Databricks Lakehouse Platform works with\nyour preferred tools like dbt, Fivetran, Power BI or\nTableau, allowing analysts and analytical engineers\nto easily ingest, transform and query the most\nrecent and complete data, without having to move\nit into a separate data warehouse. Additionally, it\nempowers every analyst across your organization\nto quickly and collaboratively find and share new\ninsights with a built-in SQL editor, visualizations\nand dashboards.\n\n**Break down silos**\n\nAccelerate time from raw to actionable\ndata and go effortlessly from BI to ML\n\n\napplications, organizations will need to manage\nan entirely different system than their SQL-only\ndata warehouse, slowing down collaboration and\ninnovation.\n\nThe Databricks Lakehouse Platform provides the\nmost complete end-to-end data warehousing\nsolution for all your modern analytics needs,\nand more. Now you can empower data teams\nand business users to access the latest data\nfaster for downstream real-time analytics and go\neffortlessly from BI to ML. Speed up the time from\nraw to actionable data at any scale ‚Äî in batch and\nstreaming. And go from descriptive to advanced\nanalytics effortlessly to uncover new insights.\n\n\nIt is challenging for data engineering teams to\nenable analysts at the speed that the business\nrequires. Data warehouses need data to be\ningested and processed ahead of time before\nanalysts can access and query it using BI tools.\nBecause traditional data warehouses lack\nreal-time processing and do not scale well for\nlarge ETL jobs, they create new data movements\nand bottlenecks for the data engineering team,\nand make it slow for analysts to access the\nlatest data.

Data is really the driver of all these initiatives. Nowadays,\ndata is often streamed and ingested from hundreds of different data sources,\nsometimes acquired from a data exchange, cleaned in various ways with\ndifferent orchestrated steps, versioned and shared for analytics and AI.\nAnd increasingly, data is being monetized.\n\nData teams rely on getting the right data at the right time for analytics, data\nscience and machine learning, but often are faced with challenges meeting\nthe needs of their initiatives for data engineering.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Why data engineering is hard\n\nOne of the biggest challenges is accessing and managing the increasingly\ncomplex data that lives across the organization. Most of the complexity\narises with the explosion of data volumes and data types, with organizations\namassing an estimated [80% of data that is unstructured and semi-structured.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/01/29/the-80-blind-spot-are-you-ignoring-unstructured-organizational-data/?sh=681651dc211c)\n\nWith this volume, managing data pipelines to transform and process data\nis slow and difficult, and increasingly expensive. And to top off the complexity,\nmost businesses are putting an increased emphasis on multicloud\nenvironments which can be even more difficult to maintain.\n\n[Zhamak Dehghani](https://databricks.com/speaker/zhamak-dehghani) , a principal technology consultant at Thoughtworks, wrote\nthat data itself has become a product, and the challenging goal of the data\nengineer is to build and run the machinery that creates this high-fidelity\ndata product all the way from ingestion to monetization.\n\n\nDespite current technological advances data engineering remains\ndifficult for several reasons:\n\n**Complex data ingestion methods**\n\nData ingestion means retrieving batch and streaming data from various\nsources and in various formats. Ingesting data is hard and complex since you\neither need to use an always-running streaming platform like Apache Kafka\nor you need to be able to keep track of which files haven‚Äôt been ingested yet.\nData engineers are required to spend a lot of time hand-coding repetitive\nand error-prone data ingestion tasks.\n\n**Data engineering principles**\n\nThese days, large operations teams are often just a memory of the past.\nModern data engineering principles are based on agile software development\nmethodologies. They apply the well-known ‚Äúyou build it, you run it‚Äù paradigm,\nuse isolated development and production environments, CI/CD, and version\ncontrol transformations that are pushed to production after validation. Tooling\nneeds to support these principles.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Third-party tools**\n\nData engineers are often required to run additional third-party tools for\norchestration to automate tasks such as ELT/ETL or customer code in\nnotebooks. Running third-party tools increases the operational overhead\nand decreases the reliability of the system.\n\n**Performance tuning**\n\nFinally, with all pipelines and workflows written, data engineers need to\nconstantly focus on performance, tuning pipelines and architectures to meet\nSLAs. Tuning such architectures requires in-depth knowledge of the underlying\narchitecture and constantly observing throughput parameters.\n\nMost organizations are dealing with a complex landscape of data warehouses\nand data lakes these days. Each of those platforms has its own limitations,\nworkloads, development languages and governance model.\n\n\nWith the Databricks Lakehouse Platform, data engineers have access to an\nend-to-end data engineering solution for ingesting, transforming, processing,\nscheduling and delivering data. The lakehouse platform automates the\ncomplexity of building and maintaining pipelines and running ETL workloads\ndirectly on a data lake so data engineers can focus on quality and reliability\nto drive valuable insights.\n\nData engineering in the lakehouse allows data teams to unify batch and\nstreaming operations on a simplified architecture, streamline data pipeline\ndevelopment and testing, build reliable data, analytics and AI workflows\non any cloud platform, and meet regulatory requirements to maintain\nworld-class governance.\n\nThe lakehouse provides an end-to-end data engineering and ETL platform\nthat automates the complexity of building and maintaining pipelines and\nrunning ETL workloads so data engineers and analysts can focus on quality\nand reliability to drive valuable insights.\n\n\n#### Databricks makes modern  data engineering simple\n\nThere is no industry-wide definition of modern data engineering.\nThis should come close:\n\n_A_ **_unified data platform_** _with_ **_managed data ingestion_** _, schema detection,_\n_enforcement, and evolution, paired with_ **_declarative, auto-scaling data_**\n**_flow_** _integrated with a lakehouse_ **_native orchestrator_** _that supports all_\n_kinds of workflows._\n\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n#### Benefits of data engineering  on the lakehouse\n\nBy simplifying and modernizing with the lakehouse architecture, data engineers\ngain an enterprise-grade and enterprise-ready approach to building data\npipelines. The following are eight key differentiating capabilities that a data\nengineering solution team can enable with the Databricks Lakehouse Platform:\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Easy data ingestion:** With the ability to ingest petabytes of data, data\nengineers can enable fast, reliable, scalable and automatic data ingestion\nfor analytics, data science or machine learning.\n\n\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Data pipeline observability:** Monitor overall data pipeline estate status\nfrom a dataflow graph dashboard and visually track end-to-end pipeline\nhealth for performance, quality, status and latency.\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Simplified operations:** Ensure reliable and predictable delivery of data for\nanalytics and machine learning use cases by enabling easy and automatic\ndata pipeline deployments into production or roll back pipelines and\nminimize downtime.\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Scheduling and orchestration:** Simple, clear and reliable orchestration\nof data processing tasks for data and machine learning pipelines with the\nability to run multiple non-interactive tasks as a directed acyclic graph\n(DAG) on a Databricks compute cluster.\n\n\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Automated ETL pipelines:** Data engineers can reduce development\ntime and effort and focus on implementing business logic and data\nquality checks within the data pipeline using SQL or Python.\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Data quality checks:** Improve data reliability throughout the data\nlakehouse so data teams can confidently trust the information for\ndownstream initiatives with the ability to define data quality and\nautomatically address errors.\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Batch and streaming:** Allow data engineers to set tunable data latency\nwith cost controls without having to know complex stream processing\nand implement recovery logic.\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Automatic recovery:** Handle transient errors and use automatic recovery\nfor most common error conditions that can occur during the operation of\na pipeline with fast, scalable fault-tolerance.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Data engineering is all about data quality**\n\nThe goal of modern data engineering is to distill data with a quality that is fit for\ndownstream analytics and AI. Within the Lakehouse, data quality is achieved on\nthree different levels.\n\n\n1. On a **technical level** , data quality is\nguaranteed by enforcing and evolving\nschemas for data storage and ingestion.\n\n**Kenesis**\n\n**CSV,**\n**JSON, TXT...**\n\n**Data Lake**\n\n\n2. On an **architectural level** , data quality is\noften achieved by implementing the medallion\narchitecture. A medallion architecture is a data\ndesign pattern used to logically organize data in\na [lakehouse](https://databricks.com/glossary/data-lakehouse) with the goal of incrementally and\nprogressively improving the structure and quality\nof data as it flows through each layer of the\narchitecture, e.g., from Bronze to Silver to Gold\nlayer tables.\n\n\n3. The **Databricks Unity Catalog** comes\nwith robust data quality management with\nbuilt-in quality controls, testing, monitoring\nand enforcement to ensure accurate and\nuseful data is available for downstream BI,\nanalytics and machine learning workloads.\n\n**Streaming**\n**analytics**\n\n\n**Bronze**\n\n\n**Silver**\n\n\n**Gold**\n\n\n**BI and**\n\n**reporting**\n\n\nRaw ingestion Filtered, cleaned, Business-level\nand history augmented aggregates\n\n**Quality**\n\n\n**Data science**\n\n**and ML**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Data ingestion\n\nWith the Databricks Lakehouse Platform, data engineers can build robust\nhyper-scale ingestion pipelines in streaming and batch mode. They can\nincrementally process new files as they land on cloud storage ‚Äî with no\nneed to manage state information ‚Äî in scheduled or continuous jobs.\n\nData engineers can efficiently track new files (with the ability to scale\nto billions of files) without having to list them in a directory. Databricks\nautomatically infers the schema from the source data and evolves it as\nthe data loads into the Delta Lake lakehouse. Efforts continue with\nenhancing and supporting Auto Loader, our powerful data ingestion\ntool for the Lakehouse.\n\n**What is Auto Loader?**\n\nHave you ever imagined that ingesting data could become as easy\nas dropping a file into a folder? Welcome to Databricks Auto Loader.\n\n[Auto Loader](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/structured-streaming/auto-loader.html) is an optimized data ingestion tool that incrementally and\nefficiently processes new data files as they arrive in the cloud storage built\ninto the Databricks Lakehouse. Auto Loader can detect and enforce the\nschema of your data and, therefore, guarantee data quality. New files or\nfiles that have been changed since the last time new data was processed\nare identified automatically and ingested. Noncompliant data sets are\nquarantined into rescue data columns. You can use the [trigger once]\noption with Auto Loader to turn it into a job that turns itself off.\n\n\n**Ingestion for data analysts: COPY INTO**\n\nIngestion also got much easier for data analysts and analytics engineers working\nwith Databricks SQL. [COPY INTO](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/spark-sql/language-manual/delta-copy-into.html) is a simple SQL command that follows the\nlake-first approach and loads data from a folder location into a Delta Lake table.\nCOPY INTO can be scheduled and called by a job repeatedly. When run, only new\nfiles from the source location will be processed.\n\n#### Data transformation\n\nTurning SQL queries into production ETL pipelines typically involves a lot\nof tedious, complicated operational work. Even at a small scale, the majority\nof a data practitioner‚Äôs time is spent on tooling and managing infrastructure.\n\nAlthough the medallion architecture is an established and reliable pattern\nfor improving data quality, the implementation of this pattern is challenging\nfor many data engineering teams.\n\nWhile hand-coding the medallion architecture was hard for data engineers,\ncreating data pipelines was outright impossible for data analysts not being\nable to code with Spark Structured Streaming in Scala or Python.\n\nEven at a small scale, most data engineering time is spent on tooling and\nmanaging infrastructure rather than transformation. Auto-scaling, observability\nand governance are difficult to implement and, as a result, often left out of the\nsolution entirely.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### What is Delta Live Tables?\n\nDelta Live Tables (DLT) is the first ETL framework that uses a simple **declarative approach** to building reliable data pipelines. DLT automatically auto-scales your\ninfrastructure so data analysts and engineers can spend less time on tooling and focus on getting value from data. Engineers are able to **treat their data as code**\nand apply modern software engineering best practices like testing, error-handling, monitoring and documentation to deploy reliable pipelines at scale. DLT fully supports\nboth Python and SQL and is tailored to work with both streaming and batch workloads.\n\nWith DLT you write a Delta Live Table in a SQL notebook, create a pipeline under Workflows and simply click [Start].\n\n\n**Write** **create live table**\n\n\n**Create** **a pipeline** **Click** **Start**\n\nStart\n\n\n-----\n\nDLT reduces the implementation time by accelerating development and\nautomating complex operational tasks. Since DLT can use plain SQL, it also\nenables data analysts to create production pipelines and turns them into\nthe often discussed ‚Äúanalytics engineer.‚Äù At runtime, DLT speeds up pipeline\nexecution applied with Photon.\n\nSoftware engineering principles are applied for data engineering to foster the\nidea of treating your data as code. Your data is the sole source of truth for what\nis going on inside your business.\n\nBeyond just the transformations, there are many things that should be included\n\nDependency\nFull refresh\nmanagement\n\n*Coming soon\n\n\nin the code that define your data. Declaratively express entire data flows in SQL\nor Python. Natively enable modern software engineering best practices like\nseparate development and production environments, the ability to easily test\nbefore deploying, deploy and manage environments using parameterization, unit\ntesting and documentation.\n\nDLT also automatically scales compute, providing the option to set the minimum\nand maximum number of instances and let DLT size up the cluster according\nto cluster utilization. In addition, tasks like orchestration, error handling and\nrecovery, and performance optimization are all handled automatically.\n\n\nIncremental\ncomputation*\n\n\nCheckpointing\nand retries\n\n\n-----\n\nExpectations in the code help prevent bad data from flowing into tables, track\ndata quality over time, and provide tools to troubleshoot bad data with granular\npipeline observability. This enables a high-fidelity lineage diagram of your\npipeline to track dependencies and aggregate data quality metrics across all\nyour pipelines.\n\nUnlike other products that force you to deal with streaming and batch workloads\nseparately, DLT supports any type of data workload with a single API so data\nengineers and analysts alike can build cloud-scale data pipelines faster without\nthe need for advanced data engineering skills.\n\n#### Data orchestration\n\nThe lakehouse makes it much easier for businesses to undertake ambitious data\nand machine learning (ML) initiatives. However, orchestrating and managing\nend-to-end production workflows remains a bottleneck for most organizations,\nrelying on external tools or cloud-specific solutions that are not part of their\nlakehouse platform. Tools that decouple task orchestration from the underlying\ndata processing platform reduce the overall reliability of their production\nworkloads, limit observability, and increase complexity for end users.\n\n#### What is Databricks Workflows?\n\n[Databricks Workflows](https://databricks.com/product/workflows) is the first fully managed and integrated lakehouse\n[orchestration](https://databricks.com/glossary/orchestration) service that allows data teams to build reliable workflows on\nany cloud.\n\n\nWorkflows lets you orchestrate data flow pipelines (written in DLT or dbt),\nas well as machine learning pipelines, or any other tasks such as notebooks\nor Python wheels. Since Databricks Workflows is fully managed, it eliminates\noperational overhead for data engineers, enabling them to focus on your\nworkflows not on managing your infrastructure. It provides an easy point-and-click\nauthoring experience for all your data teams, not just those with specialized skills.\nDeep integration with the underlying lakehouse platform ensures you will create\nand run reliable production workloads on any cloud while providing deep and\ncentralized monitoring with simplicity for end users.\n\nSharing job clusters over multiple tasks reduces the time a job takes, reduces\ncosts by eliminating overhead and increases cluster utilization with parallel tasks.\n\n\n-----\n\nDatabricks Workflows‚Äô deep integration with the lakehouse can best be seen with its monitoring and observability features. The matrix view in the following graphic\nshows a history of runs for a job. Failed tasks are marked in red. A failed job can be repaired and rerun with the click of a button. Rerunning a failed task detects and\ntriggers the execution of all dependent tasks.\n\nYou can create workflows with the UI, but also through the Databricks Workflows API, or with external orchestrators such as Apache Airflow. Even if you are using an\n\nexternal orchestrator, Databricks Workflows‚Äô monitoring acts as a single pane of glass that includes externally triggered workflows.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Orchestrate anything\n\nRemember that DLT is one of many task types for Databricks Workflows.\nThis is where the managed data flow pipelines with DLT tie together with\nthe easy point-and-click authoring experience of Databricks Workflows.\n\nIn the following example, you can see an end-to-end workflow built with\ncustomers in a workshop: Data is streamed from Twitter according to search\nterms, then ingested with Auto Loader using automatic schema detection and\nenforcement. In the next step, the data is cleaned and transformed with Delta\nLive table pipelines written in SQL, and finally run through a pre-trained BERT\nlanguage model from Hugging Face for sentiment analysis of the tweets.\nDifferent task types for ingest, cleanse/transform and ML are combined\nin a single workflow.\n\nUsing Workflows, these tasks can be scheduled to provide a daily overview of\nsocial media coverage and customer sentiment for a business. After streaming\ntweets with filtering for keywords such as ‚Äúdata engineering,‚Äù ‚Äúlakehouse‚Äù and\n‚ÄúDelta Lake,‚Äù we curated a list of those tweets that were classified as positive\nwith the highest probability score.\n\n**Learn more**\n\n\n[Data Engineering on the](https://databricks.com/solutions/data-pipelines)\n[Lakehouse](https://databricks.com/solutions/data-pipelines)\n\n\n[Delta Live Tables](https://databricks.com/product/delta-live-tables)\n\n[Databricks Workflows](https://www.databricks.com/product/workflows)\n\n\n[Big Book of Data Engineering](https://databricks.com/p/ebook/the-big-book-of-data-engineering?itm_data=datapipelines-promo-bigbookofde)\n\n\n-----\n\n**CHAPTER**\n\n### Data streaming\n# 09\n\n\n**CHAPTER**\n\n\nThere are two types of data processing: batch processing\nand streaming processing.\n\n\nBatch processing refers to the discontinuous, periodic processing\nof data that has been stored for a period of time. For example,\nan organization may need to run weekly reports on a set of\npredictable transaction data. There is no need for this data\nto be streaming ‚Äî it can be processed on a weekly basis.\n\nStreaming processing, on the other hand, refers to unbounded\nprocessing of data as it arrives.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Data Streaming Challenges**\n\nHowever, getting value from streaming data can be a tricky practice. While most\ndata today can be considered streaming data, organizations are overwhelmed by\nthe need to access, process and analyze the volume, speed and variety of this\ndata moving through their platforms. To keep pace with innovation, they must\nquickly make sense of data streams decisively, consistently and in real time.\n\nThree common technical challenges organizations experience\nwith implementing real-time data streaming include:\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Specialized APIs and language skills:** Data practitioners encounter\nbarriers to adopting streaming skillsets because there are new languages,\nAPIs and tools to learn.\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Operational complexity:** To implement data streaming at scale, data\nteams need to integrate and manage streaming-specific tools with\ntheir other cloud services. They also have to manually build complex\noperational tooling to help these systems recover from failure, restart\nworkloads without reprocessing data, optimize performance, scale the\nunderlying infrastructure, and so on.\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Incompatible governance models:** Different governance and security\nmodels across real-time and historical data platforms makes it difficult\nto provide the right access to the right users, see the end-to-end data\nlineage, and/or meet compliance requirements.\n\n\nIn a wide variety of cases, an organization might find it useful to\nleverage streaming data. Here are some common examples:\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Retail:** Real-time inventory updates help support business activities, such\nas inventory and pricing optimization and optimization of the supply chain,\nlogistics and just-in-time delivery.\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Smart energy:** Smart meter monitoring in real time allows for smart\nelectricity pricing models and connection with renewable energy sources\nto optimize power generation and distribution.\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Preventative maintenance:** By reducing unplanned outages and\nunnecessary site and maintenance visits, real-time streaming analytics can\nlower operational and equipment costs.\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Industrial automation:** Manufacturers can use streaming and predictive\nanalytics to improve production processes and product quality, including\nsetting up automated alerts.\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Healthcare:** To optimize care recommendations, real-time data allows\nfor the integration of various smart sensors to monitor patient condition,\nmedication levels and even recovery speed.\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Financial institutions:** Firms can conduct real-time analysis of\n\ntransactions to detect fraudulent transactions and send alerts. They\ncan use fraud analytics to identify patterns and feed data into machine\nlearning algorithms.\n\n\nRegardless of specific use cases, the central tenet of streaming data is that it\ngives organizations the opportunity to leverage the freshest possible insights for\nbetter decision-making and more optimized customer experiences.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Data streaming architecture**\n\nBefore addressing these challenges head-on, it may help to take a step back and\ndiscuss the ingredients of a streaming data pipeline. Then, we will explain how\nthe Databricks Lakehouse Platform operates within this context to address the\naforementioned challenges.\n\nEvery application of streaming data requires a pipeline that brings the data from\nits origin point ‚Äî whether sensors, IoT devices or database transactions ‚Äî to its\nfinal destination.\n\nIn building this pipeline, streaming architectures typically employ two layers.\nFirst, streaming capture systems **capture** and temporarily store streaming data\nfor processing. Sometimes these systems are also called messaging systems\nor messaging buses. These systems are optimized for small payloads and high\nfrequency inputs/outputs. Second, streaming **processing** systems continuously\nprocess data from streaming capture systems and other storage systems.\n\n**Capturing** **Processing**\n\n\nIt may help to think of a simplified streaming pipeline\naccording to the following seven phases:\n\n1. Data is continuously generated at origin points\n\n2. The generated data is captured from those origin points by\na capture system like Apache Kafka (with limited retention)\n\n**3. The captured data is extracted and incrementally ingested to**\n**a processing platform like Databricks; data is ingested exactly**\n**once and stored permanently, even if this step is rerun**\n\n**4. The ingested data is converted into a workable format**\n\n**5. The formatted data is cleansed, transformed and joined in**\n**a number of pipeline steps**\n\n**6. The transformed data is processed downstream through**\n**analysis or ML modeling**\n\n7. The resulting analysis or model is used for some sort of practical\napplication, which may be anything from basic reporting to an\nevent-driven software application\n\nYou will notice four of the steps in this list are in boldface. This is because the\nlakehouse architecture is specifically designed to optimize this part of the\npipeline. Uniquely, the Databricks Lakehouse Platform can ingest, transform,\nanalyze and model on streaming data _alongside_ batch-processed data. It can\naccommodate both structured _and_ unstructured data. It is here that the value\nof unifying the best pieces of data lakes and data warehouses really shines for\ncomplex enterprise use cases.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Data Streaming on the Lakehouse**\n\nNow let‚Äôs zoom in a bit and see how the Databricks Lakehouse\nPlatform addresses each part of the pipeline mentioned above.\n\n**Streaming data ingestion and transformation** begins with continuously\nand incrementally collecting raw data from streaming sources through a\nfeature called Auto Loader. Once the data is ingested, it can be transformed\nfrom raw, messy data into clean, fresh, reliable data appropriate for downstream\nanalytics, ML or applications. [Delta Live Tables (DLT)](https://www.databricks.com/product/delta-live-tables) makes it easy to build and\nmanage these data pipelines while automatically taking care of infrastructure\nmanagement and scaling, data quality, error testing and other administrative\ntasks. DLT is a high-level abstraction built on Spark Structured Streaming,\na scalable and fault-tolerant stream processing engine.\n\n**[Real-time analytics](https://www.databricks.com/product/databricks-sql)** refers to the downstream analytical application\nof streaming data. With fresher data streaming into SQL analytics or BI\nreporting, more actionable insights can be achieved, resulting in better\nbusiness outcomes.\n\n**[Real-time ML](https://www.databricks.com/product/machine-learning)** involves deploying ML models in a streaming mode. This\ndeployment is supported with structured streaming for continuous inference\nfrom a live data stream. Like real-time analytics, real-time ML is a downstream\nimpact of streaming data, but for different business use cases (i.e., AI instead\nof BI). Real-time modeling has many benefits, including more accurate\npredictions about the future.\n\n\n**Real-time applications** process data directly from streaming pipelines and\ntrigger programmatic actions, such as displaying a relevant ad, updating the\nprice on a pricing page, stopping a fraudulent transaction, etc. There typically\nis no human-in-the-loop for such applications.\n\n\nData in cloud storage and message stores\n\n\n-----\n\n**Databricks Lakehouse Platform differentiators**\n\nUnderstanding what the lakehouse architecture provides is one\n\nthing, but it is useful to understand how Databricks uniquely\n\napproaches the common challenges mentioned earlier around\n\nworking with streaming data.\n\n**Databricks empowers unified data teams.** Data engineers, data scientists\nand analysts can easily build streaming data workloads with the languages\nand tools they already know and the APIs they already use.\n\n**Databricks simplifies development and operations.** Organizations can\nfocus on getting value from data by reducing complexity and automating\nmuch of the production aspects associated with building and maintaining\nreal-time data workloads.\n\n\nSee why customers love streaming on the Databricks\nLakehouse Platform with these resources.\n\n**Learn more**\n\n[Data Streaming Webpage](https://www.databricks.com/product/data-streaming)\n\n[Project Lightspeed: Faster and Simpler Stream Processing](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/06/28/project-lightspeed-faster-and-simpler-stream-processing-with-apache-spark.html)\n[With Apache Spark](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/06/28/project-lightspeed-faster-and-simpler-stream-processing-with-apache-spark.html)\n\n[Structured Streaming Documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/structured-streaming/index.html)\n\n[Streaming ‚Äî Getting Started With Apache Spark on Databricks](https://databricks.com/spark/getting-started-with-apache-spark/streaming)\n\n\n**Databricks is one platform for streaming and batch data.** Organizations\ncan eliminate data silos, centralize security and governance models, and\nprovide complete support for all their real-time use cases under one roof ‚Äî\nthe roof of the lakehouse.\n\nFinally ‚Äî and perhaps most important ‚Äî Delta Lake, the core of the [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/product/data-lakehouse)\n\n[Lakehouse Platform](https://www.databricks.com/product/data-lakehouse) , was built for streaming from the ground up. Delta Lake is\ndeeply integrated with Spark Structured Streaming and overcomes many of\nthe limitations typically associated with streaming systems and files.\n\nIn summary, the Databricks Lakehouse Platform dramatically simplifies data\nstreaming to deliver real-time analytics, machine learning and applications on\none platform. And, that platform is built on a foundation with streaming at its\ncore. This means organizations of all sizes can use their data in motion and\nmake more informed decisions faster than ever.\n\n\n-----\n\n**CHAPTER**\n\n### Data science and  machine learning\n# 10\n\n\n**CHAPTER**\n\n\nWhile most companies are aware of the potential benefits of applying\nmachine learning and AI, realizing these potentials can often be quite\nchallenging for those brave enough to take the leap. Some of the\nlargest hurdles come from siloed/disparate data systems, complex\nexperimentation environments, and getting models served in a\nproduction setting.\n\n\nFortunately, the Databricks Lakehouse Platform provides a helping\nhand and lets you use data to derive innovative insights, build\npowerful predictive models, and enable data scientists, ML engineers,\nand developers of all kinds to create within the space of machine\nlearning and AI.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Databricks Machine Learning\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Exploratory  data analysis\n\nWith all the data in one place, data is easily\nexplored and visualized from within the\nnotebook-style experience that provides support\nfor various languages (R, SQL, Python and Scala)\nas well as built-in visualizations and dashboards.\nConfidently and securely share code with\nco-authoring, commenting, automatic versioning,\nGit integrations and role-based access controls.\nThe platform provides laptop-like simplicity at\nproduction-ready scale.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Model creation  and management\n\nFrom data ingestion to model training and tuning, all the way through to\nproduction model serving and versioning, the Lakehouse brings the tools\nneeded to simplify those tasks.\n\nGet right into experimenting with the Databricks ML runtimes, optimized and\npreconfigured to include most popular libraries like scikit-learn, XGBoost and\nmore.

Fortunately, Databricks has a built-in feature store that allows you\nto create new features, explore and re-use existing features, select features for\ntraining and scoring machine learning models, and publish features to low-latency\nonline stores for real-time inference.\n\nIf you are looking to get a head start, [AutoML](https://databricks.com/blog/2022/04/18/supercharge-your-machine-learning-projects-with-databricks-automl-now-generally-available.html) allows for low to no-code\nexperimentation by pointing to your data set and automatically training models\nand tuning hyperparameters to save both novice and advanced users precious\ntime in the machine learning process.\n\n\nAutoML will also report back metrics related to the model training results as well\nas the code needed to repeat the training already custom-tailored to your data\nset. This glass box approach ensures that you are never trapped or suffer from\nvendor lock-in.\n\nIn that regard, the Lakehouse supports the industry‚Äôs widest range of data tools,\ndevelopment environments, and a thriving ISV ecosystem so you can make your\nworkspace your own and put out your best work.\n\n##### Compute platform\n\n**Any ML workload optimized and accelerated**\n\n**Databricks Machine Learning Runtime**\n\n-  Optimized and preconfigured ML frameworks\n\n-  Turnkey distribution ML\n\n-  Built-in AutoML\n\n-  GPU support out of the box\n\n\nBuilt-in **ML frameworks**\nand **model explainability**\n\nBuilt-in support for **AutoML**\nand **hyperparameter tuning**\n\n\nBuilt-in support for\n**distributed training**\n\nBuilt-in support for\n**hardware accelerators**\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Deploy your models  to production\n\nExploring and creating your machine learning models\ntypically represents only part of the task.

Customers are loyal to brands that recognize their needs\nand preferences ‚Äî and tailor user journeys and engagements accordingly.\n\nA study from McKinsey shows [76% of consumers](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-value-of-getting-personalization-right-or-wrong-is-multiplying) are more likely to consider\nbuying from a brand that personalizes the shopping and user experience to the\nwants and needs of the customer. And as organizations pursue omnichannel\nexcellence, these same high expectations of online experiences also extend to\nbrick-and-mortar locations ‚Äî revealing for many merchants that personalized\nengagement is fundamental to attracting customers and expanding share of wallet.\n\nBut achieving a 360-degree view of your customers to serve personalized\nexperiences requires integrating various types of data ‚Äî including demographics,\nbehavioral and transactional ‚Äî to develop robust profiles. This guide focuses on six\nactionable strategic pillars for businesses to leverage automation, real-time data,\nAI-driven analysis and well-tuned ML models to architect and deliver customized\ncustomer experiences at every touch point.\n\n\n# 76%\n\nof consumers are more\nlikely to purchase due to\npersonalization\n\n\n# 76%\n\n\n-----\n\n### Building a Foundation for Personalization\n\nGet a 360-degree view of the customer by leveraging ML-based entity resolution\n\n\nTo create truly personalized interactions, you need actionable insights\nabout your customers. Start by establishing a common customer profile and\naccurately linking together customer records across disparate data sets.\n\nGet a 360-degree view of your target customer by bringing together:\n\n-  Sales and traffic-driven first-party data\n\n-  Product ratings and surveys\n\n-  Customer surveys and support center calls\n\n-  Third-party data purchased from data aggregators and online trackers\n\n-  Zero-party data provided by customers themselves\n\nLocation\n\n\n**C A S E S T U DY**\n\n**Personalizing‚Äå ‚Äåexperiences‚Äå with‚Äå ‚Äådata‚Äå ‚Äåand‚Äå ‚ÄåML‚Äå**\n\nGrab is the largest online-to-offline platform in Southeast Asia and\nhas generated over 6 billion transactions for transport, food and\ngrocery delivery, and digital payments. Grab uses Databricks to create\nsophisticated customer segmentation and recommendation engines\nthat can now ingest and optimize thousands of user-generated signals\nand data sources simultaneously, enhancing data integrity and security,\nand reducing weeks of work to only hours.\n\n[Get the full story](https://www.databricks.com/customers/grab)\n\n\n\nDemographics\n\n\nOrders\n\nNetwork/\nUsage\n\n\n‚ÄúThe C360 platform empowered teams to create\nconsumer features at scale, which in turn allows\nfor these features to be extended to other markets\nand used by other teams.

And even if inconsistent, all that data\nmay be perfectly valid ‚Äî but to accurately connect the millions of customer\nidentities most retailers manage, businesses must lean on automation.\n\nIn a machine learning (ML) approach to entity resolution, text attributes like\nname, address and phone number are translated into numerical representations\nthat can be used to quantify the degree of similarity between any two attribute\nvalues. But your ability to train such a model depends on your access to\naccurately labeled training data. It‚Äôs a time-consuming exercise, but if done right,\nthe model learns to reflect the judgments of the human reviewers.\n\nMany organizations rely on libraries encapsulating this knowledge to build their\napplications and workflows. One such library is [Zingg](https://www.zingg.ai/) , an open source library\nbringing together ML-based approaches to intelligent candidate pair generation\nand pair-scoring. Oriented toward the construction of custom workflows, Zingg\npresents these capabilities within the context of commonly employed steps\nsuch as training data label assignment, model training, data set deduplication,\nand (cross-data set) record matching.\n\nBuilt as a native Apache Spark TM application, Zingg scales well to apply these\ntechniques to enterprise-sized data sets. Organizations can then use Zingg in\ncombination with platforms such as Databricks Lakehouse to provide the back\nend to human-in-the-middle workflow applications that automate the bulk of\nthe entity resolution work and present data experts with a more manageable\nset of edge case pairs to interpret.\n\n\nAs an active-learning solution, models can be retrained to take advantage of\nthis additional human input to improve future predictions and further reduce\nthe number of cases requiring expert review. Finally, these technologies can be\nassembled to enable their own enterprise-scaled customer entity resolution\nworkflow applications.\n\n**Need help building your foundation for a**\n**360-degree view of your customers?**\n\nGet pre-built code sample data and step-by-step instructions\nin a Databricks notebook in the **Customer Entity Resolution**\n**Solution Accelerator.**\n\n**‚Ä¢** Translating text attributes (like name, address, phone number)\ninto quantifiable numerical representations\n\n**‚Ä¢** Training ML models to determine if these numerical labels\nform a match\n\n**‚Ä¢** Scoring the confidence of each match\n\n**[GET THE ACCELERATOR](https://www.databricks.com/solutions/accelerators/customer-entity-resolution)**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Estimating Customer Lifetime Value\n\nBuilding brand loyalty to drive share of wallet with data\n\n\nOnce you‚Äôve set up a 360-degree view of the customer, the next challenge\nis how to spend money to profitably grow the brand. The goal is to spend\nmarketing dollars on activities that attract loyal customers and avoid spending on\nunprofitable customers or activities that damage the brand. Keep in mind, that\nmaking decisions solely based on ROI isn‚Äôt the answer. This one-track approach\ncould ultimately weaken your brand equity and make you more dependent on\nlowering your price through promotions as a way to generate sales.\n\n**C A S E S T U DY**\n\n\n**Identifying and engaging brand loyalists**\n\nToday‚Äôs customer has overwhelmingly abundant options in products and\nservices to choose from. That‚Äôs why personalizing customer experiences is so\nimportant, as it increases revenue, marketing efficiency and customer retention.\n\nNot every customer carries the same potential for profitability. Different\ncustomers derive different value from your products and services, which directly\ntranslates into differences in the overall amount of value a business can expect\nin return. Mutually beneficial relationships carefully align customer acquisition\ncost (CAC) and retention rates with the total revenue or customer lifetime value\n(CLV).\n\n\n**Predicting and increasing customer lifetime value with ML**\n\n\nKolibri Games, creators of Idle Miner Tycoon and Idle Factory Tycoon,\nattracts over 10 million monthly active users. With Databricks, they\nachieved a 30% increase in player LTV, improved data team productivity\nby 3x, and reduced ML model-to-production time by 40x.\n\n[Get the full story](https://databricks.com/customers/kolibri-games)\n\nWithin your existing customer base are people ranging from brand loyalists to\nbrand transients. Brand loyalists are highly engaged with your brand, are willing\nto share their experience with others, and are the most likely to purchase\nagain. Brand transients have no loyalty to your brand and shop based on price.\nYour focus should be on growing the group of brand loyalists while minimizing\ninteractions with brand transients.\n\n\n**Calculating customers‚Äô lifetime intent**\n\nTo assess the remaining lifetime in a customer relationship, businesses must\n\ncarefully examine the transactional signals and other indicators from previous\ncustomer engagements and transactions.\n\nFor example, if a frequent customer slows down their buying habits ‚Äî or simply\ndoesn‚Äôt make a purchase for an extended period of time ‚Äî it may signal the\nupcoming end of the relationship. However, in the case of another customer\nwho engages infrequently, the same extended absence may not signal anything\nnotable. The infrequent buyer may continue to purchase even after a long pause\nin activity.\n\n\n-----\n\nCustomer A\n\nCustomer B\n\nCustomer C\n\n\nPast Future\n\nDifferent customers with the same number of transactions, but signaling different lifetime intent. The probability of re-engagement (P_alive) relative to a customer‚Äôs history of purchases.\n\n\nEvery customer relationship with a business has a lifespan. Understanding what\npoint in the lifespan at a given time provides critical insight to inform marketing\nand sales tactics. By proactively discovering shifts in the relationship, you can\nadapt how to respond to each customer at the optimal time. For example, a\ncertain signal might prompt a change in how to deliver products and services,\nwhich could help maximize revenue.\n\nTransactional signals can be used to estimate the probability that a customer\nis active and likely to return in the future. Popularized as the Buy ‚Äôtil You Die\n(BTYD) model, analysts can compare a customer‚Äôs frequency and recency of\n\nengagement to similar patterns across their user population to accurately\npredict individual CLV.\n\n\nThe mathematics behind these predictive CLV models is complex, but the logic\nbehind these critical models is accessible through a popular Python library\nnamed Lifetimes, which allows the input of simple summary metrics in order to\nderive customer-specific lifetime estimates.\n\n**C A S E S T U DY**\n\n**How personalized experiences keep customers coming**\n**back for more**\n\nPublicis Groupe empowers brands to transform retail experiences with\ndigital technologies, but data challenges and team silos stood in the\nway of delivering the personalization that their customers required.\nSee how they use Databricks to create a single customer view that\nallows them to drive customer loyalty and retention.

With a bevy of options at their disposal,\ncustomer churn is a reality that companies face and are focused on overcoming\nevery day. One [recent analysis](https://info.recurly.com/annual-subscription-billling-metrics-report?submissionGuid=3c21cde7-5f58-4d86-9218-332d697e7b3e) of consumer-oriented subscription services\nestimated a segment average 7.2% monthly rate of churn. When narrowed to\nbrands focused on consumer goods, that rate jumped to 10.0%. This figure\ntranslates to a lifetime of 10 months for the average subscription box service,\nleaving businesses of this kind with little time to recover acquisition costs and\nbring subscribers to net profitability.\n\n**C A S E S T U DY**\n##### Riot Games\n\n**Creating an optimal in-game experience for League of Legends**\n\nRiot Games is one of the top PC game developers in the world, with over\n100 million monthly active users, 500 billion data points, and over 26\npetabytes of data and counting. They turned to Databricks to build a more\n\nefficient and scalable way to leverage data and improve the overall gaming\nexperience ‚Äî ensuring customer engagement and reducing churn.\n\n[Get the full story](https://www.databricks.com/customers/riot-games)\n\nOrganizations must take an honest look at the cost of acquisition relative to a\ncustomer‚Äôs lifetime value (LTV) earned. These figures need to be brought into a\n\nhealthy balance and treated as a ‚Äúchronic condition‚Äù [to be managed.](https://retailtouchpoints.com/features/trend-watch/can-subscription-retail-solve-its-customer-retention-problem)\n\n\n**Understanding attrition predictability through subscriptions:**\n**Examining retention-based acquisition variables**\n\nPublic data for subscription services is extremely hard to come by. KKBox, a\nTaiwan-based music streaming service, recently released over two years of\nanonymized [subscription data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kkbox-churn-prediction-challenge) to examine customer churn. Through analyzing\nthe data, we uncover customer dynamics familiar to any subscription provider.\n\nMost subscribers join the KKBox service through a 30-day trial offer. Customers\nthen appear to enlist in one-year subscriptions, which provide the service with\na steady flow of revenue. Subscribers typically churn at the end of the 30-day\ntrial and at regular one-year intervals.\n\nThe Survival Rate reflects the proportion of the initial (Day 1) subscriber population that is\nretained over time, first at the roll-to-pay milestone, and then at the renewal milestone.\n\n\n-----\n\nBy Initial Payment Method\n\ntimeline\n\nCustomer attrition by subscription day on the KKBox streaming service for\ncustomers registering via different payment methods.\n\nBy Initial Payment Plan Days\n\ntimeline\n\nCustomer attrition by subscription day on the KKBox streaming service for\ncustomers selecting different initial payment methods and terms/days.\n\n\nThis pattern of high initial drop-off, followed by a period of slower but continuing\ndrop-off cycles makes intuitive sense. Where it gets interesting is when the\ndata changes. The patterns of customer churn become vastly different as time\npasses and new or changing elements are introduced (e.g., payment methods\nand options, membership tiers, etc.).\n\nBy Registration Channel\n\ntimeline\n\nCustomer attrition by subscription day on the KKBox streaming service for\ncustomers registering via different channels.\n\n\n-----\n\nThese patterns seem to indicate that KKBox _could_ potentially differentiate\nbetween customers based on their lifetime potential, using only the information\navailable at subscriber acquisition. In the same way, non-subscription businesses\ncould use similar data techniques to get an accurate illustration of the total\nlifetime value of a particular customer, even before collecting historical data.\n\nThis information can help businesses target certain shoppers with effective\ndiscounts or promotions as early as trial registration. Nevertheless, it‚Äôs always\nimportant to consider more than individual data points.\n\nThe baseline risk of customer attrition over a subscription lifespan.\n\n\nThe channel and payment method multipliers combine to explain a customer‚Äôs risk of attrition\nat various points in time. The higher the value, the higher the proportional risk of churn in the\nassociated period.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Applying churn analytics to your data**\n\nThis analysis is useful in two ways: **1)** to quantify the risk of customer churn and\n**2)** to paint a quantitative picture of the specific factors that explain that risk,\ngiving analysts a clearer understanding of what to focus on, what to ignore and\nwhat to investigate further. The main challenge is organizing the input data.\n\nThe data required to examine customer attrition may be scattered across\nmultiple systems, making an integrated analysis difficult. [Data lakes](https://databricks.com/discover/data-lakes/introduction) support\nthe creation of transparent, sustainable data processing pipelines that are\nflexible, scalable and highly cost-efficient. Remember that **churn is a chronic**\n**condition to be managed** , and attrition data should be periodically revisited to\nmaintain alignment between acquisition and retention efforts.\n\n**Need help predicting customer churn?**\n\nUse the **Subscriber Churn Prediction Accelerator** to analyze\nbehavioral data, identify subscribers with an increased risk of\ncancellation, and predict attrition.

Today, these marketing campaigns include leaflets and\ncoupons mailed to individual households, manufacturer coupon matching,\nin-store discounts and the stocking of various private-label alternatives to\npopular national brands.\n\nRecognizing uneven response rates between households, the team is eager to\ndetermine if customers might be segmented based on their responsiveness\nto these promotions. They anticipate that such segmentation may allow the\npromotions management team to better target individual households, driving\noverall higher response rates for each promotional dollar spent.\n\nUsing historical data from point-of-sale systems along with campaign\ninformation from their promotions management systems, the team derives\na number of features that capture the behavior of various households with\nregard to promotions. Applying standard data preparation techniques, the data\nis organized for analysis and using a variety of clustering algorithms, such as\nk-means and hierarchical clustering, the team settles on two potentially useful\ncluster designs.\n\n\n-----\n\nOverlapping segment designs separating households based on their responsiveness to\nvarious promotional offerings.

Subsequent analyses will also examine the revenue\n\ngenerated by various households to understand how changes in promotional\nengagement may impact customer spending.\n\nUsing this information, the team believes they will have the ability to make a case\nfor change to upper management. Should a change in promotions targeting be\napproved, the team makes plans to monitor household spending, promotions\nspend and campaign responsiveness rates using much of the same data used in\nthis analysis.

To operationalize personalized experiences, it‚Äôs\nimportant to identify high-value audiences who have the highest likelihood of\nspecific actions. Here‚Äôs where **propensity scoring** comes in.\n\nSpecifically, this process allows companies to estimate customers‚Äô potential\nreceptiveness to an offer or to content related to a subset of products, and\ndetermine which messaging to apply. Calculating propensity scores requires\nassessment of past interactions and data points (e.g., frequency of purchases,\npercentage of spend associated with a particular product category, days since\nlast purchase and other historical data).\n\nDatabricks provides critical capabilities for propensity scoring (like the Feature\nStore, AutoML and MLflow) to help businesses answer three key considerations\nand develop a robust process:\n\n**1.** How to maintain the significant number of features used\nto train propensity models\n\n**2.** How to rapidly train models aligned with new campaigns\n\n**3.** How to rapidly re-deploy models, retrained as customer\npatterns drift, into the scoring pipeline\n\n**Boosting model training efficiency**\n\nWith the [Databricks Feature Store](https://docs.databricks.com/applications/machine-learning/feature-store/index.html) , data scientists can easily reuse features\ncreated by others.\n\n\nThe feature store is a centralized repository that enables the persistence,\ndiscovery and sharing of features across various model training exercises.\nAs features are captured, lineage and other metadata are captured. Standard\nsecurity models ensure that only permitted users and processes may\nemploy these features, enforcing the organization‚Äôs data access policies on\ndata science processes.\n\n**Extracting the complexities of ML**\n\n[Databricks AutoML](https://docs.databricks.com/applications/machine-learning/automl.html) allows you to quickly generate models by leveraging industry\nbest practices. As a glass box solution, AutoML first generates a collection of\nnotebooks representing various aligned model variations. In addition to iteratively\ntraining models, AutoML allows you to access the notebooks associated with each\nmodel, creating an editable starting point for further exploration.\n\n**Streamlining the overall ML lifecycle**\n\n[MLflow](https://docs.databricks.com/applications/mlflow/index.html) is an open source machine learning model repository, managed within the\nDatabricks Lakehouse. This repository enables tracking and analysis of the various\nmodel iterations generated by both AutoML and custom training cycles alike.\n\nWhen used in combination with the Databricks Feature Store, models persisted\nwith MLflow can retain knowledge of the features used during training. As models\nare retrieved, this same information allows the model to retrieve relevant features\nfrom the Feature Store, greatly simplifying the scoring workflow and enabling\nrapid deployment.\n\n\n-----\n\n**How to build a propensity scoring workflow with Databricks**\n\nUsing these features in combination, many organizations implement propensity\nscoring as part of a three-part workflow:\n\n**1.** Data engineers work with data scientists to define features relevant\nto the propensity scoring exercise and persist these to the Feature Store.\nDaily or even real-time feature engineering processes are then defined\nto calculate up-to-date feature values as new data inputs arrive.\n\nModel Training\nand Deployment\n\n\n**2.** As part of the inference workflow, customer identifiers are presented to\npreviously trained models in order to generate propensity scores based on\nthe latest features available. Feature Store information captured with the\nmodel allows data engineers to retrieve these features and easily generate\nthe desired scores, which can then be used for analysis within Databricks\nLakehouse or published to downstream marketing systems.\n\n**3.** In the model-training workflow, data scientists periodically retrain the\npropensity score models to capture shifts in customer behaviors. As these\nmodels are persisted to MLfLow, change management processes are used\nto evaluate and elevate those models that meet organizational criteria-toproduction status. In the next iteration of the inference workflow, the latest\nproduction version of each model is retrieved to generate customer scores.\n\n\nScore Generation\nand Publication ETL\n\n**Need help assessing interest from your**\n**target audience?**\n\n\nFeature\nEngineering ETL\n\nFeature Store Profiles\n\n\nSales\n\nPromotions\n\nCustomer\n\n\nUse the **Propensity Scoring Accelerator** to estimate\ncustomers‚Äô potential receptiveness to an offer or to\ncontent related to a subset of products.

Consolidating\n\ne-commerce orders. Optimizing distribution to ensure item availability. Routing delivery vehicles. These\n\ndecisions happen thousands of times daily and have a significant financial impact. Retailers need real-time data\n\nto support these decisions, but legacy systems are limited to data that‚Äôs hours or days old.\n\n**When seconds matter, only the Lakehouse delivers better decisions**\n\nRetail is a 24/7 business where customers expect accurate information and immediate relevant feedback.\n\nThe integration of physical and e-commerce customer experiences into an omnichannel journey has been\n\nhappening for the past 20 years, but the pandemic provided a jolt to consumer trends that dramatically shifted\n\npurchasing patterns.\n\nIn reaction to these industry changes, retailers have responded with significant, rapid investments ‚Äî including\n\nstronger personalization, order fulfillment, and delivery and loyalty systems. While these new targeted\n\ncapabilities have addressed the immediate need ‚Äî and created expectations of making decisions in real\n\ntime ‚Äî most retailers still rely on legacy data systems, which impedes their ability to scale these innovations.\n\nUnfortunately, most legacy systems are only able to process information in hours or days.\n\nThe delays caused by waiting for data are leading to significant risks and costs for the industry.\n\n**Grocers** need to consolidate order picking to achieve profitability in e-commerce, but this requires up-to-\n\nthe-minute order data. Not having this information causes them to spend more resources on having people\n\npick orders separately, at a higher operating cost.\n\n**Apparel retailers** must be able to present the correct available inventory on their website. This requires\n\nthat in-store sales be immediately reflected in their online systems. Inaccurate information can lead to lost\n\nsales, or worse, the customer becoming unsatisfied and moving to different retailers.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Convenience fuel retailers** must collaborate with distribution centers, direct-to-store delivery distributors\n\nand other partners. Having delayed data can lead to out-of-stocks, costing stores thousands of dollars per\n\nweek.\n\nThe margin of error in retail has always been razor thin, but with a pandemic and inflationary pressures, it‚Äôs at\n\nzero. Reducing the error rate requires better predictions and real-time data.\n\n**Use Case Guide**\n\nIn this use case guide, we show how the Databricks Lakehouse for Retail is helping leading organizations take\n\n**all of their data in a single lakehouse architecture, streamline their data engineering and management,**\n\n**make it ready for SQL and ML/AI** , and **do so very fast within their own cloud infrastructure environment**\n\n**based on open source and open standards** . These capabilities are all delivered at world-record-setting\n\nperformance, while achieving a market-leading total cost of ownership.\n\nDatabricks Lakehouse for Retail has become the industry standard for enabling retailers to drive decisions\n\nin real time. This use case guide also highlights common use cases across the industry, and offers additional\n\nresources in the form of Solution Accelerators and reference architectures to help as you embark on your own\n\njourney to drive better customer experiences with data and AI.\n\n\n-----\n\n**CHAPTER 2:**\n### Modern Data Platform\n for Real-Time Retail\n\n\nRetailers continue to adapt to rapidly shifting dynamics across the omnichannel. In navigating these\n\nchanges, retailers are increasingly focused on improving the real-time availability of data and insights, and\n\nperforming advanced analytics delivered within tight business service windows.\n\n**Common challenges**\n\nIn response to the surge in e-commerce and volatility in their supply chains, retailers are investing millions\n\nin modernizing distribution centers, partnering with delivery companies, and investing in customer\n\nengagement systems.\n\nWarehouse automation is expected to become a $41B market according to Bloomberg. Increasingly,\n\ndistribution centers are being automated with robotics to power dynamic routing and delivery. Shoppers\n\nthat became accustomed to having fast, same-day, and sometimes even overnight delivery options\n\nduring the pandemic now expect them as the norm. Retailers understand that the shipping and delivery\n\nexperience is now one of many touchpoints that merchants can use to develop customer brand loyalty.\n\n## $41B Market | Retail Warehouse Automation\n\nYet while retailers modernize different areas of their operations, they‚Äôre constrained by a single point of\n\nweakness, as they are reliant on legacy data platforms to bring together all of this data.\n\nPowering real-time decisions in modern retail requires real-time ingestion of data, transformation,\n\ngovernance of information, and powering business intelligence and predictive analytics all within the time\n\nrequired by retail operations.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Ingesting large volumes of transactional data in real time.** The biggest blocker to crucial insights\n\nis the ability to ingest data from transaction systems in real time. Transaction logs from point-of-sale\n\nsystems, clickstreams, mobile applications, advertising and promotions, as well as inventory, logistics\n\nand other systems, are constantly streaming data. Big data sets need to be ingested, cleansed and\n\naggregated and integrated with each other before they can be used. The problem? Retailers have used\n\nlegacy data warehouses that are built around batch processing. And worse, increasing the frequency\n\nof how often data is processed leads to a ‚Äúhockey stick‚Äù in costs. As a result of these limitations,\n\nmerchants resort to ingesting data nightly to deal with the large volumes of data and integration with\n\nother data sets. The result? Accurate data to drive decisions can be delayed by days.\n\n**Performing fine-grained analysis at scale within tight time windows.** Retailers have accepted a\n\ntrade-off when performing analysis. Predictions can be detailed and accurate, or they can be fast.\n\nRunning forecasts or price models at a day, store and SKU level can improve accuracy by 10% or more,\n\nbut doing so requires tens of millions of model calculations that need to be performed in narrow service\n\nwindows. This is well beyond the capability of legacy data platforms. As a result, companies have been\n\nforced to accept the trade-off and live with less accurate predictions.\n\n**\u0007Powering real-time decisions on the front line.** Data is only useful if it drives decisions, but serving\n\nreal-time data to thousands of employees is a daunting task. While data warehouses are capable\n\nof serving reports to large groups of users, they‚Äôre still limited to stale data. Most retailers limit the\n\nfrequency of reports to daily or weekly updates and depend on the staff to use their best judgment for\n\ndecisions that are more frequent.\n\n**\u0007Delivering a hyper-personalized omnichannel experience.** The storefront of the 21st century is\n\nfocused on delivering personalized experiences throughout the omnichannel. Retailers have access to\n\na trove of customer data, and yet off-the-shelf tools for personalization and customer segmentation\n\nstruggle to deal with high volumes, and the analytics have high rates of inaccuracy. Retailers need to\n\ndeliver personalized experiences at scale to win in retail.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### The Lakehouse for Retail\n\nDatabricks Lakehouse for Retail solves these core challenges. The Lakehouse unlocks the ability to unify\n\nall types of data ‚Äî from images to structured data ‚Äî in real time, provide enterprise-class management\n\nand governance, and then immediately turn that data into actionable insights with real-time reporting and\n\npredictive analytics.

Real-time supply chain data allows customers to deal with problems as they happen and before\n\nitems are sent downstream or shipped to consumers, which is the first step in enabling a supply chain\n\ncontrol tower.\n\n**R E L E V A N T F O R**\n\n\nRetail Consumer\nGoods\n\n\nManufacturers Distributors Logistics Restaurants\n\n\n**Challenges**\n\n**\u0007Batch data** ‚Äî existing data warehouses bring data in batch, creating a lag between when something is\n\nhappening and when a customer can act on it\n\n**\u0007Complex analysis in real time** ‚Äî if ingesting data in real time wasn‚Äôt a big enough challenge, companies\n\nhave the added pressure to take immediate action on it\n\n**\u0007Complex maintenance** ‚Äî ETL tools to bring data in batch are often complex and costly to maintain\n\n\n-----\n\n**Value with the Databricks Lakehouse**\n\nDatabricks has enabled real-time streaming of supply chain data across a variety of customers for specific\n\nplant operations or as part of a supply chain control tower.\n\n**\u0007Near real-time ingestion and visibility of data** ‚Äî one customer experienced a 48,000%\n\nimprovement in speed to data, with greater reliability\n\n**\u0007Cost-neutral** ‚Äî because Delta‚Äôs efficient engine requires smaller instances, many customers report\n\nthat they were able to move from batch to real-time at neutral costs\n\n**ÔøΩSimplified architecture and maintenance** ‚Äî leveraging Delta for ingestion streamlines the pattern for\n\nreal-time data ingestions. Customers frequently report that the amount of code required to support\n\nstreaming ingestion is 50% less than previous solutions.\n\n**\u0007Immediate enablement of additional use cases** ‚Äî customers can now prevent problems as they‚Äôre\n\nhappening, predict and prevent issues, and even gain days on major changes such as production\n\nschedules between shifts\n\n**Solution overview**\n\nDatabricks allows for both streaming and batch data sets to be ingested and made available to enable\n\nreal-time supply chain use cases. Delta Lake simplifies the change data capture process while providing\n\nACID transactions and scalable metadata handling, and unifying streaming and batch data processing.

It is used by replenishment\n\nplanning, distributors and consumer goods companies performing vendor-managed replenishment (VMR) or\n\nvendor-managed inventory (VMI) to make daily decisions on which product needs to be sent to which store\n\nand on what day.\n\nReplenishment is challenging for companies because it deals with rapidly changing data and the need to\n\nmake complex decisions on that data in narrow service windows. Retailers need to stream in real-time sales\n\ndata to signal how much of a product has been sold in order. Inaccurate sales data leads to an insufficient\n\nnumber of products being sent to stores. This results in lost sales and low customer satisfaction.\n\nInventory allocation is a process that might be performed multiple times a day during peak seasons, or\n\ndaily during slower seasons. Companies need the ability to scale to perform tens of millions of predictions\n\nmultiple times a day ‚Äî on demand and dynamically ‚Äî during peak season without paying a premium for\n\nthis capability throughout the year.\n\n**R E L E V A N T F O R**\n\n\nRetail Consumer\nGoods\n\n\nDistributors Logistics Restaurants\n\n\n-----\n\n**Challenges**\n\n\u0007Customers must complete tens of millions of inventory allocation predictions within tight time windows.\n\nThis information is used to determine which products get put on trucks and go to specific stores.\n\n\u0007Traditional inventory allocation rules cause trade-offs in accuracy in order to calculate all possibilities in\n\nthe service windows\n\n\u0007Legacy tools have rudimentary capabilities and have limited ability to consider flavors, sizes and other\n\nattributes that may be more or less popular by store\n\n**Value with Databricks**\n\nCustomers are able to complete inventory allocation models within SLAs with no trade-off for accuracy.\n\n\u0007 **Speed ‚Äî** on average, customers moving to Databricks for demand forecasting report a double-digit\n\nimprovement in forecast accuracy\n\n\u0007 **Ability to scale** and perform fine-grained (day, store, item) level allocations\n\n\u0007 **Provide more robust allocations** by incorporating causal factors that may increase demand, or include\n\ninformation on flavors or apparel sizes for specific stores\n\n**Solution overview**\n\nThe objective of inventory allocation is to quickly determine when to distribute items and where ‚Äî from\n\nwarehouses and distribution centers to stores. Inventory allocation begins by looking at the consumption\n\nrate of products, the available inventory and the shipping schedules, and then using this information to\n\ncreate an optimized manifest of what items should be carried on which trucks, at what point, and at what\n\ntime. This becomes the plan for route accounting systems that arrange deliveries.\n\nInventory allocation also deals with trade-offs related to scarcity of items. If an item has not been available\n\nin a store for a long time, that store may receive heightened priority for the item in the allocation.\n\n\n-----\n\nHOW TO GET STARTED\n\n\n**Typical use case data sources include:** point of sale, digital sales, replenishment data, modeled safety\n\nstock, promotions data, weather\n\n**View our webinar covering demand forecasting with Starbucks and then read our blog about**\n\n**demand forecasting.**\n\n**[Demand forecasting with causal factors.](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2020/03/26/new-methods-for-improving-supply-chain-demand-forecasting.html)**\n\nOur most popular notebook at Databricks.

Historically, point-of-sale (POS) systems\n\nrecorded all in-store transactions, but were traditionally kept in a system that was physically in the store.\n\nThis would result in a delay in actionable insights. And now with consumers increasingly shopping online, it‚Äôs\n\ncrucial to not only collect and analyze that clickstream data quickly, but also unify it with POS data to get a\n\ncomplete and real-time snapshot of each customer‚Äôs shopping behavior.\n\nNear real-time availability of information means that retailers can continuously update their estimates of\n\nitem availability. No longer is the business managing operations based on their knowledge of inventory\n\nstates as they were a day prior, but instead is taking actions based on their knowledge of inventory states as\n\nthey are now.\n\n**R E L E V A N T F O R**\n\nRetail E-commerce\n\n**Challenges**\n\n\u0007Retailers with legacy POS systems in their brick-and-mortar stores are working with siloed and\n\nincomplete sales data\n\n\u0007Both POS and clickstream data need to be unified and ingested in real time\n\n\n-----\n\nHOW TO GET STARTED\n\nContact your Databricks account team\n\n\n**Value with Databricks**\n\nDatabricks brings POS and clickstream data together for a unified data source that leads to real-time\n\ninsights and a clearer understanding of customer behavior.\n\n\u0007 **Single source of truth** ‚Äî a centralized, cloud-based POS system means it can be merged with\n\nclickstream data\n\n\u0007 **Near real-time insights** ‚Äî the greater speed to data means businesses get the latest insights into\n\ncustomer purchasing behaviors and trends\n\n\nto have them perform a free proof-of-\n\n\nconcept with your real-time data.\n\n\n\u0007 **Scalability** ‚Äî companies can scale with Databricks to handle data from countless transactions\n\n\n-----\n\n**CHAPTER 7**\n### Use Case: On-Shelf Availability\n\n\n**Overview**\n\nEnsuring the availability of a product on shelf is the single largest problem in retail. Retailers globally are\n\nmissing out on nearly $1 trillion in sales because they don‚Äôt have on hand what customers want to buy in\n\ntheir stores. Shoppers encounter out-of-stock scenarios as often as one in three shopping trips. All told,\n\nworldwide, shoppers experience $984 billion worth of out-of-stocks, $144.9 billion in North America alone,\n\naccording to industry research firm IHL.\n\nIn the past, if a customer faced an out-of-stock, they would most likely select a substitute item. The cost\n\nof going to another store prevented switching. Today, e-commerce loyalty members, such as those who\n\nbelong to Walmart+ and Amazon Prime, are 52% more likely than other consumers to purchase out-of-stock\n\nitems online. It is believed that a quarter of Amazon‚Äôs retail revenue comes from customers who first tried to\n\nbuy a product in-store. In all, an estimated $36 billion is lost to brick-and-mortar competition, and another\n\n$34.8 billion is lost to Amazon or another e-retailer, according to IHL.\n\nOn-shelf availability takes on a different meaning in pure e-commerce applications. An item can be\n\nconsidered in stock when it is actually in a current customer‚Äôs basket. If another customer places the same\n\nitem in their basket, there is the possibility that the first customer will purchase the last available item\n\nbefore the second customer. This problem is exacerbated by retailers who use stores to keep inventory. In\n\nthese situations, customers may order an item that is picked for delivery at a much later time. The window\n\nbetween ordering and picking creates the probability of out-of-stocks.\n\nOn-shelf availability predicts the depletion of inventory by item, factors in safety stock levels and\n\nreplenishment points, and generates a signal that suggests an item may be out of stock. This information is\n\nused to generate alerts to retail staff, distributors, brokers and consumer goods companies. Every day, tens\n\nof thousands of people around the world do work that is generated by these algorithms.\n\nThe sheer volume of data used to calculate on-shelf availability prevents most companies from analyzing\n\nall of their products. Companies have between midnight and 4 AM to collect all of the needed information\n\nand run these models, which is beyond the capability of legacy data systems. Instead, companies choose\n\nthe priority categories or products to analyze, which means a significant percentage of their unavailable\n\nproducts will not be proactively addressed.\n\n\n-----\n\nOne of the biggest challenges with on-shelf availability is determining when an item is actually out of stock.\n\nWhile some retailers are investing in computer vision and robots, and others employ the use of people to\n\nmanually survey item availability, most retailers default to a signal of determining when an item has not been\n\nscanned in an acceptable time.\n\n**R E L E V A N T F O R**\n\n\nRetail Consumer\nGoods\n\n\nE-commerce Direct to\nConsumer\n\n\n**Challenges**\n\nThe biggest challenge to generating on-shelf availability alerts is time. Companies may receive their final sales\n\ndata from the preceding day shortly after midnight. They have less than 4 hours from that point to ingest large\n\nvolumes of t-log data and calculate probabilities of item availability. Most firms are encumbered by a data\n\nwarehouse process that only releases data after it has been ingested and aggregates have been calculated, a\n\nprocess that can require multiple hours per night.\n\nFor this reason, most firms make sacrifices in their analysis. They may alternate categories they analyze by\n\ndifferent days, prioritize only high-impact SKUs, or run analysis at higher-level and less-accurate aggregate\n\nlevels. Among the challenges:\n\n\u0007Processing large volumes of highly detailed data and running millions of models in a narrow time window\n\n\u0007Companies are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars annually to generate these daily alerts for a\n\nfew categories\n\n\u0007Dealing with false positives and negatives in predictions\n\nDistributing information quickly and efficiently to internal systems and external partners\n\n\n-----\n\n**Value with Databricks**\n\nDatabricks enables customers to generate on-shelf availability (OSA) predictions at scale with no\n\ncompromises.\n\n**\u0007** Delta removes the data processing bottleneck.

One of the\n\nbiggest challenges in t-log data is the frequent number of changes to a transaction that can occur within\n\na data. Delta Lake simplifies this with transaction awareness using a transaction log, and creates additional\n\nmetadata for easier retrieval. Data is made available in a fraction of the time needed in data warehouse-\n\nbased systems. This is why the largest retailers in the world are using Delta Lake for processing t-log data.\n\nOnce data is available, users need to generate predictions about item availability on the shelf. With its\n\nextremely performant engine and the ability to distribute computation across countless nodes, Spark\n\nprovides the perfect platform for calculating out-of-stocks. Customers no longer need to run in aggregate\n\nor against a subset of data.\n\n\n-----\n\n**HOW TO GET STARTED**\n\n[Solution Accelerator:](https://www.databricks.com/solutions/accelerators/on-shelf-availability)\n\n[On-Shelf Availability](https://www.databricks.com/solutions/accelerators/on-shelf-availability)\n\nIn this solution, we show how the\n\nDatabricks Lakehouse Platform enables\n\nreal-time insights to rapidly respond\n\n\nAnd lastly, data is only useful if it drives better outcomes.

Retailers that were able to implement these new services have been able to differentiate overall\n\ncustomer experiences and mitigate catastrophic hits on revenue levels.\n\nFor retailers to create a seamless contactless experience for customers, they need real-time data to\n\nknow when a customer has arrived and where they‚Äôre located, as well as provide updates throughout the\n\npickup journey. And through the use of computer vision, they can capture that data by employing optical\n\nrecognition on images to read vehicle license plates.\n\nRetailers can also use information captured from license plates to make recommendations on buying\n\npatterns.

The way that retailers achieve this\n\nis by recommending products and services that align with customer needs.\n\nProviding an experience that makes customers feel understood helps retailers stand out from the crowd\n\nof mass merchants and build loyalty. This was true before COVID, but shifting consumer preferences make\n\nthis more critical than ever for retail organizations. With research showing the cost of customer acquisition\n\nis as much as five times as retaining existing ones, organizations looking to succeed in the new normal must\n\ncontinue to build deeper connections with existing customers in order to retain a solid consumer base.\n\nThere is no shortage of options and incentives for today‚Äôs consumers to rethink long-established patterns\n\nof spending.\n\nRecommendation engines are used to create personalized experiences for users across retail channels.\n\nThese recommendations are generated based on the data collected from purchases, items interacted\n\nwith, users‚Äô behavior across physical and digital channels, and other data such as from customer service\n\ninteractions and reviews. Leveraging a Customer 360 architecture that collects all user clickstream and\n\nbehavioral data, marketers are able to create recommendations that are integrated with other business\n\nobjectives such as highlighting items that are on promotion or product availability.\n\nCreating recommendations is not a monolithic activity. Recommendation engines are used to personalize\n\nthe customer experience in every possible area of consumer engagement, from proactive notifications and\n\noffers, to landing page optimization, suggested products, automated shipment recommendations, cross-sell\n\nand upsell, and even suggestions for complementary items after the purchase.\n\n\n-----\n\n**R E L E V A N T F O R**\n\n\nRetail E-commerce Direct to\nConsumer\n\n\nMedia Telecom Financial Services\n(any B2B or B2C\ncompany)\n\n\n**Challenges**\n\nRecommendation engines are very difficult to do well. Many companies use off-the-shelf recommenders,\n\nbut traditional off-the-shelf systems suffer from high rates of inaccuracy. In our analysis, we found general\n\nrecommenders with 29% variance, meaning that of every 10 recommendations delivered, 3 would be\n\nirrelevant.\n\n**Massive volumes of highly detailed and frequently changing data.** Recommendation accuracy\n\nis improved by having recent data, and yet most systems struggle to handle the large volumes of\n\ninformation involved.\n\n**Creating a 360 view of the customer.** Identity and being able to stitch together all customer\n\ntouchpoints in one place are critical to enabling this use case. More data, including transaction and\n\nclickstream data, is critical for driving accuracy and precision in messaging.\n\n**Processing speed.** Retailers need to be able to frequently refresh models based on constantly\n\nchanging dynamics, and deliver real-time recommendations via APIs.\n\n**Automation.** This is an ‚Äúalways-on‚Äù use case where automation is essential for scalability and\n\nresponsiveness based on frequent model updates.\n\n\n-----\n\nMany firms choose to use recommender systems from Amazon or Google. Using these systems trains\n\nthe general recommendation engine in a way that helps competitors improve the accuracy of their own\n\nrecommendations.\n\n**Value with Databricks**\n\nRecommendations are one of the most critical capabilities that a retailer maintains. This is a capability that\n\nretailers must own, and Databricks provides a solid platform for enabling this.\n\nUsing Databricks as the foundation for their Customer 360 architecture to deliver omnichannel\n\npersonalization, sample value metrics from a media agency include:\n\n**200% ROI for 70% of retailers** engaging in advanced personalization\n\n**10% improvement** in conversions\n\n**35% improvement** in purchase frequency\n\n**37% improvement** in customer lifetime value\n\n**Solution overview**\n\nRecommendations are only as good as the data that powers them.

And more importantly, how do we\n\npredict these buying moments when customers are not in our stores?\n\nThe purpose of a propensity-to-buy model is to predict when a customer is predisposed to make a\n\npurchase and subsequently act on that information by engaging customers. Traditional propensity-to-buy\n\nmodels leveraged internal sales and loyalty data to identify patterns of consumption. These models are\n\nuseful, but are limited in understanding the full behavior of customers. More advanced propensity-to-buy\n\nmodels are now incorporating alternative data sets to identify trips to competing retailers, competitive scan\n\ndata from receipts, and causal data that helps to explain when and why customers make purchases.\n\nPropensity-to-buy models create a signal that is sent to downstream systems such as those for promotion\n\nmanagement, email and mobile alerts, recommendations and others.\n\n**R E L E V A N T F O R**\n\nRetail E-commerce Direct to\nConsumer\n\n\n-----\n\n**Challenges**\n\n**\u0007** Customers do not want to be inundated with messages from retailers.

Today, new\ninsights are derived as quickly as data can move in the insurance industry. This speed has increased as insurers collect vast amounts of customer\ndata from new sources, such as IoT sensors, smartwatches that provide insight into consumers‚Äô health data, and online behavior that includes\nclickstream data, spending habits, and frequented websites. As a result, the data strategy has become even more complex.\n\nConsumers want stronger reassurance for what they value most: financial security and greater peace of mind.\nInsurers have always prided themselves on delivering such protection and security. However, customer needs\nhave changed, and insurers that move most swiftly to satisfy them will be in the best position to navigate\nchallenging times. The bottom line is that insurers must adapt to these changes and meet the evolving needs of\ntheir customers to remain competitive.\n\nData-driven insurers will seek opportunities to improve the customer experience, develop more sophisticated\npricing models, and increase their operational resilience. More than ever, the total cost of ownership (TCO) of\ndigital investments and enterprise data strategy has become a top priority for boards and senior executives\nin the insurance industry. So, what does this mean from a data and analytics perspective? It all comes down\nto having one reliable source of truth for data, which is derived from batch and streaming data, structured and\nunstructured data, from multiple clouds and jurisdictions.\n\n\nIn a regulated and risk-averse industry where data sharing was once seen as optional, it has now become\nfundamental. To compete in the digital economy, insurers need an open and secure approach to data sharing.\nDatabricks Lakehouse for Insurance plays a critical role in helping insurance providers accelerate innovation and\ntransform their businesses, resulting in significant operational efficiencies and improved customer experiences\nat a fraction of the cost of data warehouses. This eBook provides an in-depth exploration of key challenges\nand common use cases in the insurance industry. Most importantly, you will gain insight into how Databricks\nLakehouse can unlock the true value of your data through practical Solution Accelerators and a wide range of\npartners available to assist you on your journey.\n\n\n**The future of insurance will**\n\n**become increasingly data-driven,**\n\n**and analytics enabled.‚Äù**\n\n**[EY‚Äôs](https://www.ey.com/en_us/insurance/five-principles-for-the-future-of-protection)** [‚ÄúFive principles for the future of protection‚Äù](https://www.ey.com/en_us/insurance/five-principles-for-the-future-of-protection)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Lakehouse reference architecture below illustrates a sample framework upon\nwhich insurers can build. Moving from left to right in the diagram, the first layer\nrepresents various data sources such as on-premises systems, web and mobile\napplications, IoT sensors, enterprise data warehouses, and third-party APIs. Data\nis then ingested through automated data pipelines, and processed within the\nLakehouse platform across three layers (Bronze, Silver and Gold). These layers\nare responsible for data preparation, including ML model registry, centralized\n\n\ngovernance, workflow orchestration, and job scheduling. They ensure a compliant\nand secure infrastructure that sits atop the cloud layer (or multiple clouds),\neliminating the need for data duplication. Finally, the transformed data is delivered\nas actionable insights and supports use cases such as automated reporting,\nbusiness analytics, customer 360, and claims analytics. These use cases not only\nmitigate risk but also drive revenue.\n\n\n**Data Sources**\n\n**On-Premises**\n**Servers**\n\n\n**Ingestion**\n\n\n**Lakehouse for Financial Services**\n\n**Bronze Layer** **Silver Layer** **Gold Layer**\n\n\n**Serving**\n\n**Automated**\n**Reporting**\n\n\n**Web and Mobile**\n**Applications**\n\n\n**Business Analytics**\n**and Interactive**\n**Dashboards**\n\n\n**Raw Entity Data**\n\n\n**Curated Feature**\n**Sets**\n\n\n**Aggregated**\n**Business Views**\n\n\n**Automated Data Pipelines**\n**(Batch or Streaming)**\n\n**Collaborative**\n**Data Source**\n\n\n**Internet-of-Things**\n**(IoT) Devices**\n\n\n**Enterprise Data**\n**Warehouses**\n\n\n**Third-Party APIs**\n**and Services**\n\n\n**ML Model**\n**Registry**\n\n\n**Centralized Data**\n**Governance**\n\n\n**Workflow**\n**Orchestration**\n\n\n**Productionized**\n**Referenced Data**\n**and Models**\n\n**Job Scheduling**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Three Trends Driving Transformation in Insurance\n\nOver the next decade, technology-enabled insurance companies will bear little resemblance to today‚Äôs organizations.\nThe following three trends are driving this transformation in the insurance industry:\n\n\n**The rapid emergence of large language**\n**models and generative AI**\n\nIn recent years, there has been a significant\nbreakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence with\nthe emergence of large language models (LLMs)\nand generative AI. These models, such as GPT-4 and\nits predecessors, Databricks Dolly and others are\nbuilt using deep learning techniques and massive\namounts of training data, enabling them to generate\nhuman-like text and perform a wide range of natural\nlanguage processing tasks. LLMs and generative AI\ncan help insurance companies automate repetitive\ntasks such as underwriting, claims processing,\n\nand customer service, improving efficiency and\nreducing costs. They can also help insurers to better\nunderstand customer needs and preferences,\nleading to more personalized products and services.\nHowever, as with any disruptive technology, the\nadoption of LLMs and generative AI will require\ncareful consideration of ethical and regulatory\nissues, such as data privacy and algorithmic bias.\n\n\n**Transformed ecosystems**\n**and open insurance**\n\n[According to EY](https://assets.ey.com/content/dam/ey-sites/ey-com/en_gl/topics/insurance/ey-2022-global-insurance-outlook-report.pdf) , leading companies leverage\ninsurtechs in their ecosystems to achieve high\nmargins in commoditized products. Open insurance,\nwhich involves sharing and managing insurancerelated data through APIs, is more than an item in\nthe regulatory agenda. It can give consumers access\nto better products and accurate pricing, as well as\nenable them to execute transactions more easily.\nIn its [annual Chief Data Officer Survey](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/data-sharing-is-a-business-necessity-to-accelerate-digital-business) , Gartner\nfound that organizations that promote external data\nsharing have three times the measurable economic\n\nbenefit across a variety of performance metrics\ncompared to their peers.\n\n\n**Revised target operating model**\n**with a focus on talent**\n\nDemographic shifts and perennial cost pressures\nmake it critical for insurers to attract and retain\ntalent. Consequently, it‚Äôs important for insurers\nto equip their workforces with the right tools\nand technologies to help them identify business\nprocesses that can be optimized to differentiate\nthemselves from their competitors, with an emphasis\non moments that matter in the customer journey,\naccording to EY. Recent research from Deloitte\nhighlights the advantages of upskilling and building\na future-ready workforce. One of the benefits\n\nof AI adoption in the workforce is that it enables\norganizations to automate a wide range of business\nprocesses, boosting speed and efficiency. But what‚Äôs\neven more important is that it enables employees to\nfocus on higher-value work, according to Deloitte.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Need for Modern Data Infrastructure\n\n**Insurers turning to cloud and data analytics**\n\n\nThe insurance industry has undergone significant changes over the years, and\none of the areas that has evolved the most is data management. With the\ngrowing need for advanced analytics and digital transformation, many insurance\ncompanies are turning to cloud technology and modern data infrastructures\nto enhance their data management strategies. The benefits of adopting cloud\ntechnology are numerous, particularly the ability to efficiently store and quickly\naccess vast amounts of data, which is crucial in a heavily regulated and datadriven industry like insurance. Additionally, the flexibility of the cloud enables\ninsurers to scale costs, adapt to changing work environments, and meet evolving\ncustomer and business requirements.\n\n\ndynamic pricing and underwriting, and form the foundation for claims automation.\nBy implementing advanced analytics, insurers can innovate more easily, scale their\nbusinesses, and bring new products to market more quickly.\n\nTo remain competitive, insurance companies must increase their investment in\ncloud technology and data analytics, as this will accelerate insightful decisionmaking across various functions such as claims management, underwriting,\npolicy administration, and customer satisfaction. Overall, the adoption of cloud\ntechnology and data analytics is imperative for insurance providers to enhance\noperational efficiency, improve business processes, and stay relevant in today‚Äôs\nfast-paced business landscape.\n\n\nFurthermore, insurance providers can leverage the cloud to analyze customer\ndata at scale, gaining insights into behaviors that drive hyper-personalization,\n\n\n-----\n\n**Let‚Äôs take a closer look look at a few examples:**\n\n\n**Auto insurers** need to integrate new data sources, such as weather and traffic,\nto build solutions capable of real-time processing. This enables them to alert\nemergency services promptly and gain a better understanding of drivers‚Äô driving\npatterns. It also enables the development of sophisticated machine learningbased risk assessment, underwriting and claims models.\n\n**Commercial insurance** , including property, general liability, cyber insurance and\nbusiness income insurance, utilizes ML-based automation of actuarial models.\nThis automation facilitates underwriting, claims forecasting and dynamic pricing\nfor their customers. Another notable trend in recent years is the use of IoT-\n\n\nbased alerting for sensitive or valuable commodities. For example, in the case of\nvaccines, IoT sensors can monitor the temperature in real time and send alerts to\nthe appropriate team or person if the temperature exceeds acceptable thresholds.\nThis is crucial as vaccines must be stored within specific temperature ranges.\n\nIn **life insurance** , complex ML models can be employed to create a profile of\nthe customer‚Äôs lifestyle and, importantly, detect any changes to it. This deeper\nunderstanding and 360-degree view of the customer enable more customized\nunderwriting and pricing based on the policyholder‚Äôs current health, lifestyle and\neating habits.\n\n\n|Type of Data Source|Typical Vendors|High-priority business use caes Claims Automation Dynamic Pricing Anomoly Detection Customer 360 and and Transformation and Underwriting and Fraudulent Claims Hyper-Personalization|Col4|Col5|Col6|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Policy data|Guidewire, Duck Creek, Majesco, FINEOS, EIS, Unqork|||||\n|Claims data|Guidewire, Duck Creek, Majesco, FINEOS, EIS, Unqork, TransUnion|||||\n|Real-time ingestions|Cambridge Mobile Telematics, Zendrive, Custom|||||\n|Alternative / Supplemental data|Experian, Equifax, Verisk, IBM Weather|||||\n|Marketing data|Salesforce, HubSpot, Google Analytics|||||\n\n\n**Figure 1.** Innovating with data and analytics ‚Äî use cases made possible and key data sources from popular insurance vendors\n\n\n-----\n\n## Common Challenges Insurers Face Using Legacy Technology\n\n\nModernization is not an easy process for insurers, and while transforming IT\necosystems is necessary to improve business outcomes, ensuring business\ncontinuity is absolutely critical. However, the volume of data they collect, along\nwith changes in user behavior and legacy systems that can‚Äôt handle this amount of\ndata, are forcing insurance providers to accelerate their modernization journeys.\n\nInsurance providers face several challenges when using legacy technology, including:\n\n**Legacy on-premises systems:** Legacy on-premises systems are not only\nexpensive to maintain, but they also store large amounts of big data in silos across\nthe business. This makes it difficult to access the data, hindering data analytics\nefforts and limiting executives‚Äô ability to make informed business decisions.\n\n**Ingesting large volumes of transactional data in real time:** The inability to\ningest data from transaction systems in real time is a major obstacle to obtaining\ncritical insights. Transaction logs from operations such as policy administration,\nenrollment and claims constantly stream data. However, many insurance\ncompanies still rely on legacy data warehouses built around batch processing,\nwhich is not suitable for ingesting and integrating large data sets. As a result,\ninsurers often opt to ingest data nightly, leading to delays in receiving accurate\ndata for decision-making.\n\n\n**Performing fine-grained analysis at scale within tight time frames:** Legacy\ntechnology forces insurers to make a trade-off when analyzing data for user intent.\nThey can choose between detailed and accurate predictions or fast predictions.\nRunning detailed forecasts can improve accuracy, but it requires performing\nmillions of model calculations within narrow service windows, which exceeds the\ncapability of legacy data platforms. Consequently, insurance companies have to\naccept less accurate predictions.\n\n**Powering real-time decisions on the front line:** Serving real-time data to\nthousands of workers is a complex task. While data warehouses can serve reports\nto large groups of users, they are limited to providing stale data. As a result, most\ninsurers only provide daily or weekly updates to reports and rely on employees‚Äô\njudgment for more frequent decisions.\n\n**Delivering a hyper-personalized omnichannel experience:** Today‚Äôs insurers aim\nto deliver personalized experiences across every channel, both digital and offline.\nWhile insurance providers have access to vast amounts of customer data, off-theshelf tools for personalization and customer segmentation struggle to handle such\nhigh volumes, leading to inaccurate analytics. To succeed in the insurance industry,\ncompanies must deliver personalized experiences at scale.\n\n\n-----\n\nDatabricks Lakehouse for Insurance addresses the key challenges faced across the\ninsurance value chain.

The Lakehouse platform is well suited for these new use cases as it\noffers native support for streaming, making it easy for insurance carriers to incrementally ingest data.\n\n**Business problem**\n\nActuaries are spending valuable time on low-value activities, which hampers agility and advanced analytical\ncapabilities in pricing and underwriting, hindering improvements in risk and pricing modeling.\n\n**Solution/value with Databricks**\n\n**‚Ä¢** Unified cloud-native platform\n\n**‚Ä¢** Scalability for ingesting IoT data from millions of trips, expanding the customer base\n\n**‚Ä¢** Reduced total cost of ownership compared to legacy Hadoop systems\n\n**‚Ä¢** Usage-based pricing, leading to lower premiums for customers and reduced risk for insurance carriers, thereby\nlowering loss ratios\n\n**‚Ä¢** Enables the creation of a digitally enabled, end-to-end underwriting experience\n\n**Business outcomes and benefits**\n\n\n**C U S T O M E R C A S E S T U D Y**\n\n**American financial services**\n**mutual organization**\n\nThis organization aimed to leverage the vast\namounts of structured and unstructured data\nit collected to enhance its underwriting and\ndecision-making processes, enabling greater\nefficiency and effectiveness. However, the\ncompany‚Äôs legacy infrastructure struggled\nto scale with the increasing data volume and\nprocessing demands, limiting its ability to\nanalyze the data and derive actionable insights.\n\nWith Databricks, the insurer centralized\neverything on one unified Lakehouse platform,\n\nsupporting all operational and analytical\nuse cases. This allowed them to analyze\nbroader sets of data for superior underwriting\nperformance and create a digitally empowered,\nend-to-end underwriting experience.\n\n\n\n**‚Ä¢** Improve competitive position\n\n**‚Ä¢** Decrease combined ratio\n\n**‚Ä¢** 15% improvement in efficiencies\n\n\n-----\n\n**K E Y U S E C A S E**\n## Anomaly detection and fraudulent claims\n\n**Overview**\n\n\n**C U S T O M E R C A S E S T U D Y**\n\n**One of the largest U.S.**\n**insurance companies and a**\n**leading small business insurer**\n\nThe increasing availability of data and market\ncompetition challenge insurance providers to\noffer better pricing to their customers. This\nU.S.-based insurer, with hundreds of millions of\ninsurance records to analyze for downstream\nML, realized that their legacy batch analysis\nprocess was slow and inaccurate, providing\nlimited insight for predicting the frequency\nand severity of claims. With Databricks, they\nwere able to scale up the use of deep learning\nmodels, resulting in more accurate pricing\npredictions and increased revenue from\nclaims. By leveraging Databricks Lakehouse,\nthey harmonized data, analytics and AI at\nscale, enabling accurate pricing predictions\nand supporting various use cases from vehicle\ntelematics to actuarial modeling.\n\n\nFraud continues to grow at a rapid rate, posing a threat to the revenue and growth of companies. For example,\nAmerican consumers reported losing more than $5.8 billion to fraud in 2021, a 70% increase from $3.4 billion\nin 2020, according to the Federal Trade Commission. The insurance industry is undergoing transformational\nchange to support new channels and services, offering transactional features and facilitating payments through\ndigital channels to remain competitive. However, the speed and convenience of these capabilities benefit both\nconsumers and fraudsters. Building a fraud framework requires more than just highly accurate machine learning\nmodels. It often involves a complex decision science process that combines a rules engine with a robust and\nscalable machine learning platform.\n\n**Business problem**\n\nInsurers need the ability to identify fraudulent activity and respond to new suspicious trends in near real-time.\n\n**Solution/value with Databricks**\n\nModernized approaches in insurance require full digital transformation, including the adoption of usagebased pricing to reduce premiums. Insurance providers now consume data from the largest mobile telematics\nproviders (e.g., CMT) to obtain granular sensor and trip summaries for users of online insurance applications.\nThis data is crucial not only for pricing but also for underwriting scenarios to mitigate risks for carriers.\n\n**$1 of fraud costs companies 3.36x in chargeback,**\n**replacement and operational costs**\n\n\n[Lexis Nexis](https://risk.lexisnexis.com/insights-resources/research/2020-true-cost-of-fraud-retail)\n\n\n-----\n\n**K E Y U S E C A S E**\n\n## Customer 360 and hyper-personalization\n\n\n**Overview**\n\nWinning the hearts and minds of your customers\nstarts with personalizing the user experience. The\nability to offer complementary products to meet\nthe needs of your customers lets you build deeper\nrelationships with them and engender their loyalty.\nIn addition, a better understanding of the finer\ndetails within accounts allows you to offer them\nmore personalized products. To do this, you need\n360-degree customer views, which requires you to\nlocate and consolidate all your customers‚Äô contact\ndata from every digital tool that you use and house\nit in one central location. With Databricks Lakehouse,\ninsurers can ‚Äúhyper-personalize,‚Äù increase\ncross-sell/upsell opportunities, enhance customer\n360 and bring new products to market faster.\n\n**Business problem**\n\nThe inability to reconcile customer records across\ndifferent lines of business limits real-time customer\ninsights necessary for upselling and cross-selling.\nSiloed data makes it challenging to create accurate\nand comprehensive customer profiles, resulting in\nsuboptimal recommendations for the next best action.\n\n\n**Solution/value with Databricks**\n\nDatabricks provides the tools needed to process\nlarge volumes of data and determine the next best\naction at any point in the customer journey.\n\n**‚Ä¢** Eliminates data silos by unifying all customer data,\nincluding basic information, transactional data,\nonline behavior/purchase history, etc., to create\ncomplete customer profiles\n\n**‚Ä¢** Integrated data security ensures that security\nmeasures are incorporated at every layer of the\nDatabricks Lakehouse Platform\n\n**‚Ä¢** Delta improves data quality, providing a single\nsource of truth for real-time streams and ensuring\nreliable and high-quality data for data teams\n\n**‚Ä¢** Integrated ML and AI capabilities utilize AI to\ncreate self-optimizing ML models that determine\nthe next best step for each customer\n\n**‚Ä¢** MLflow model lifecycle management helps manage\nthe entire machine learning lifecycle reliably,\nsecurely and at scale\n\n\n**Business outcomes and benefits**\n\n**‚Ä¢** Use AI, ML, automation and real-time data to\ngain deeper customer insights and understand\ntheir needs\n\n**‚Ä¢** Improve competitive positioning\n\n**‚Ä¢** Enhance the customer experience\n\n**C U S T O M E R C A S E S T U D Y**\n\n**160-year-old U.S.**\n**insurance company**\n\nThis insurance provider underwent a significant\ndigital transformation to provide a more\npersonalized financial services experience to\nits 10,000 advisors and millions of customers\nacross various touchpoints.

The pace and scale\nof technological change are likely to increase due to factors such as artificial\nintelligence (AI), cloud computing, and the entry of new players like insurtechs,\ne-tailers, and manufacturers from outside the insurance industry.\n\nTo succeed and thrive in today‚Äôs economic environment, insurers should prioritize\nupgrading their infrastructure and technology, rather than solely focusing on\ntransforming operations. For example, migrating from on-premises systems to the\ncloud can bring significant benefits, according to global consultancy [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/articles/us175368_cfs_fsi-outlook-insurance/DI_US175368_CFS_FSI-Outlook-Insurance.pdf) [.](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/articles/us175368_cfs_fsi-outlook-insurance/DI_US175368_CFS_FSI-Outlook-Insurance.pdf)\n\nAs insurers upgrade their compliance processes to meet new global regulations,\nsuch as IFRS 17 and LDTI, the impact of regulatory updates becomes more\ncomplex for organizations operating across multiple jurisdictions. Instead of\nmerely responding to regulatory and industry requirements, insurance companies\nshould make data-focused investments that help them anticipate and meet the\nexpectations of distributors and policyholders.\n\n\n**IFRS-17**\n\nIFRS 17 is an International Finance Reporting Standard (IFRS) for\ninsurance contracts. IFRS 17 aims to standardize insurance accounting\nby providing consistent principles for all facets of accounting for\ninsurance contracts. IFRS 17 removes existing inconsistencies so\nanalysts, investors and others can more easily compare companies,\ncontracts and industries.\n\n**LDTI for long-duration contracts**\n\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board long-duration targeted\nimprovements (LDTI) introduced changes to the U.S. GAAP accounting\nmodel to simplify and improve the financial reporting of long-duration\ncontracts, including providing financial statement users with more\ntimely and relevant information about those contracts.\n\n\nIt is crucial for insurers to redirect their focus toward developing advanced data\nmanagement and utilization capabilities that offer better insights and improved\nperformance. These investments serve as not only a foundation for regulatory\ncompliance but also a starting point for more comprehensive and proactive\ntransformation initiatives.\n\n\n-----\n\n**I N D U S T R Y S O L U T I O N S**\n\n## Get Started With Accelerators, Brickbuilders and Enablers\n\nInsurance Solution Accelerators and enablers are pre-built collateral to help customers rapidly develop and deploy technical capabilities to accelerate value.\n\n**Adoption challenges**\n\n\nNumerous challenges hinder organizations from developing and implementing the\nnecessary technical solutions to enhance their operational effectiveness, increase\nrevenue, and stay competitive. These challenges include:\n\n**‚Ä¢** Lack of technical skills (data scientists/data engineers): Companies often\nstruggle to find employees proficient in Python or Scala, or individuals who\npossess extensive experience in data science.\n\n\n\n**‚Ä¢** Business problems require in-depth data science and industry knowledge:\nBusinesses seek solutions tailored to address specific problems, rather than\ngeneric technical features.\n\n**‚Ä¢** Companies seek actionable insights: Organizations prefer readily applicable\npatterns that can be quickly implemented, rather than custom data science\nsolutions that come with potential costs and risks of implementation failure.\n\n\n**What are accelerators/enablers?**\n\n\n**Solution Accelerators**\n\nSave hours on discovery, design, development and\ntesting with Databricks Solution Accelerators.

The end-to-end claims\nprocess, from extracting relevant information from documentation submitted\nwhen filing a claim to triaging and routing claims and the underwriting process,\nis ripe for digital transformation. By leveraging the Databricks Lakehouse,\norganizations can handle millions of data points coming in different formats and\ntime frames, from various sources, at an unprecedented volume. Every touchpoint\nin the claims journey, starting even before an incident occurs, will be supported by\na combination of technology and human intervention that seamlessly expedites\nthe process. Personalizing the claims experience by anticipating needs, providing\nreal-time status alerts, and reducing friction in the process increases customer\nloyalty and retention.\n\n\n**Customer/Partner Successes**\n\n**Accelerate underwriting through collaboration and efficient ML**\n\nA leading P&C insurer took full advantage of the MongoDB and Databricks\nintegration, leveraging both platforms to foster collaboration between their data\nand developer teams. The integration provides a more natural development\nexperience for Spark users and exposes all of Spark‚Äôs libraries. This allows\nMongoDB data to be materialized as DataFrames and data sets for analysis\nusing machine learning, graph, streaming and SQL APIs. The insurer also benefits\nfrom automatic schema inference. With this integration, the insurer was able to\ntrain and observe their ML models (MongoDB Atlas Charts) more efficiently and\nincorporate them into business applications.\n\nAs a result, crucial underwriting processes that previously took days are now executed\nin seconds. In addition to the time and cost savings, the company can provide a more\nimmediate response to customers within its digital experience platform.\n\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n\n**Watch video:**\n\n\n**[F R A U D D E T E C T I O N](https://notebooks.databricks.com/notebooks/FSI/geospatial_analysis/index.html#geospatial_analysis_1-0.html)**\n\n**Claims processing is the process whereby an insurer receives,**\n\n\n**verifies and processes a claim report submitted by a policyholder.**\n\n**It accounts for** **[70% of a property insurer‚Äôs expenses](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/financial-services/insurance-claims-transformation.html)** **and is a**\n\n**criticial component of customer satisfaction with their carrier.‚Äù**\n\n\n**[C L A I M S A U T O M AT I O N E N A B L E R](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/02/01/design-patterns-batch-processing-financial-services.html)**\n\n\n[Laying the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkckhRjezxs\r)\n[Foundation for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkckhRjezxs\r)\n[Claims Automation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkckhRjezxs\r)\n\n\n**[C A R C L A I M S I M A G E C L A S S I F I C AT I O N](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/car-classification)**\n\n\n**Deloitte,** [‚ÄùPreserving the human touch in insurance claims transformations‚Äù](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/financial-services/insurance-claims-transformation.html)\n\n**[S M A R T C L A I M S : C L A I M S A U T O M AT I O N](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/04/03/claims-automation-databricks-lakehouse.html)**\n\n\n-----\n\n**Risk management:**\n**dynamic pricing and underwriting**\n\nModernized approaches at insurance carriers require a full digital transformation,\nand one aspect of this transformation involves dynamic pricing and underwriting\nto reduce premiums. Insurance providers are now consuming data from the largest\nmobile telematics providers to obtain the most granular sensor and trip summaries\nfor users of online insurance applications. Not only is this data critical for pricing,\nbut it is also critical for underwriting scenarios to de-risk carriers. Dynamic pricing\nand underwriting automate routine tasks and provide teams with alternative\ndata sources to empower actuarial and underwriting professionals to become\n‚Äúexponential.‚Äù This allows teams to focus on key aspects of risk selection and\nanalysis that drive competitive advantage and market differentiation. By leveraging\npersonalized data points, insurers can deliver near real-time underwriting\ndecisions for life insurance applicants, reducing policy abandonment and costs.\n\n\n**Customer/Partner Successes**\n\n**Automated extraction of medical risk factors for life insurance underwriting**\n**(John Snow Labs)**\n\nLife insurance underwriting considers an applicant‚Äôs medical risk factors in\naddition to mortality risk characteristics. These risk factors are often found\nin free-text documents. New insurance-specific natural language processing\n(NLP) models can automatically extract relevant medical history and risk factors\nfrom such documents. Forward-thinking companies are embracing accelerated\nunderwriting, which utilizes new data along with algorithmic tools and modeling\ntechniques to quickly assess and group applicants without requiring bodily fluids,\nphysician‚Äôs notes, and so on.

Read the entire guide or dive straight into a\nspecific challenge.\n\nWith the advent of cloud infrastructure, a new generation of\nstartups has rapidly built and scaled their businesses. The use of\ncloud infrastructure, once seen as innovative, has now become\ntable stakes. The differentiator for the fastest-moving startups\nand digital natives now comes from the effective use of data\nat scale, primarily analytics and AI. Digital natives ‚Äî defined\nas fast-moving, lean, and technically savvy, born-in-the-cloud\norganizations ‚Äî are beginning to focus on new data-driven use\ncases such as real-time machine learning and personalized\ncustomer experiences.\n\nTo pursue these new data-intensive use cases and initiatives,\norganizations must look beyond the technologies that delivered\nthem to this point in time. Over time, these technologies, such\nas transactional databases, streaming/batch pipelines and firstgeneration analytics engines, have led to brittle\n\nThis guide examines some of the biggest data challenges and\nsolutions for startups and for scaling digital native businesses\nthat have reached the point where an end-to-end modern data\nplatform is a smart investment. Some key considerations include:\nsystems that are not cost-efficient and require time-consuming\nadministration and engineering toil. In addition to growing\nmaintenance needs, data is often stored in disparate locations\nand formats, with little or no governance, making real-time use\ncases, analytics and AI difficult or impossible.\n\n\n**Consolidating on a unified data platform**\nAs mentioned above, siloed data storage and management add administrative and\nfinancial cost. You can benefit significantly when you unify your data in one location\nwith a flexible architecture that scales with your needs and delivers performance\nfor future success. For this, you will want an open platform that supports all your\ndata including batch and streaming workloads, data analytics and machine learning.\nWith data unification, you create a more efficient, integrated approach to ingesting,\ncleaning and organizing your data. You also need automation to make data analysis\neasier for the nontechnical users in the company. But broader data access also\nmeans more focus on security, privacy, compliance and access control, which can\ncreate overhead for a growing.\n\n**Scaling up capacity and increasing performance**\n**and usability of the data solutions**\nData teams at growing digital native organizations find it time intensive and costly to\nhandle the growing volume and velocity of their data being ingested from multiple\nsources, across multiple clouds. You now need a unified and simplified platform that\ncan instantly scale up capacity and deliver more computing power on demand to\nfree up your data teams to produce outputs more quickly. This lowers the total cost\nfor the overall infrastructure by eliminating redundant licensing, infrastructure and\nadministration costs.\n\n**Building effective machine learning operations**\nFor data teams beginning their machine learning journeys, the challenge of training\ndata models can increase in management complexity. Many teams with disparate\ncoding needs for the entire model lifecycle suffer inefficiencies from transferring\ndata and code across many separate services. To build and manage effective\nML operations, consider an end-to-end MLOps environment that brings all data\ntogether in one place and incorporates managed services for experiment tracking,\nmodel training, feature development and feature and model serving.\n\n\n-----\n\n# 01\n```\nCHALLENGE: \u0003\n\n## Create a unified data architecture for data quality, governance and efficiency\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nCHALLENGE 01\n\n### Create a unified data architecture for data quality, governance and efficiency\n\n```\nAs cloud-born companies grow, data volumes rapidly increase, leading to new\nchallenges and use cases. Among the challenges:\n\n\nApplication stacks optimized for transaction\nuse cases aren‚Äôt able to handle the volume,\nvelocity and variety of data that modern data\nteams require. For example, this leads to query\nperformance issues as data volume grows.\n\nData silos develop as each team within an\norganization chooses different ETL/ELT and\nstorage solutions for their needs. As the\norganization grows and changes, these pipelines\nand storage solutions become brittle, hard to\nmaintain and nearly impossible to integrate.\n\n\nThese data silos lead to discoverability,\nintegration and access issues, which prevent\nteams from leveraging the full value of the\norganization‚Äôs available data.\n\nData governance is hard. Disparate ETL/ELT\nand storage solutions lead to governance,\ncompliance, auditability and access control\nchallenges, which expose organizations to\ntremendous risk.\n\n\nThe Databricks Lakehouse Platform provides\na unified set of tools for building, deploying,\nsharing and maintaining data solutions at scale.\nIt integrates with cloud storage and the security\nin your cloud account, manages and deploys\ncloud infrastructure on your behalf. Your data\npractitioners no longer need separate storage\nsystems for their data. And you don‚Äôt have to rely\non your cloud provider for security. The lakehouse\nhas its own robust security built into the platform.\n\n\nFor all the reasons above, the most\nconsistent advice from successful data\npractitioners is to create a ‚Äúsingle source\nof truth‚Äù by unifying all data on a single\nplatform. With the Databricks Lakehouse\nPlatform, you can unify all your data on one\nplatform, reducing data infrastructure costs\nand compute. You don‚Äôt need excess data\ncopies and you can retire expensive\nlegacy infrastructure.\n```\n                            01\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nCUSTOMER STORY: GRAMMARLY\n\n### Helping 30 million people and 50,000 teams communicate more effectively\n\n```\n\nWhile its business is based on analytics, [Grammarly](http://www.grammarly.com)\n\nfor many years relied on a homegrown analytics\n\nplatform to drive its AI writing assistant to\n\nhelp users improve multiple aspects of written\n\ncommunications. As teams developed their own\n\nrequirements, data silos inevitably emerged as\n\ndifferent business areas implemented analytics\n\ntools individually.\n\n‚ÄúEvery team decided to solve their analytics\n\nneeds in the best way they saw fit,‚Äù said Chris\n\nLocklin, Engineering Manager, Data Platforms,\n\nat Grammarly. ‚ÄúThat created challenges in\n\nconsistency and knowing which data set\n\nwas correct.‚Äù\n\nTo better scale and improve data storage and\n\nquery capabilities, Grammarly brought all its\n\nanalytical data into the Databricks Lakehouse\n\nPlatform and created a central hub for all data\n\nproducers and consumers across the company.\n\nGrammarly had several goals with the lakehouse,\n\nincluding better access control, security, ingestion\n\n\nflexibility, reducing costs and fueling collaboration. ‚ÄúAccess control in a\n\ndistributed file system is difficult, and it only gets more complicated as\n\nyou ingest more data sources,‚Äù said Locklin.

Here are three steps to get started with the\nDatabricks Lakehouse Platform:\n\n**Understand the architecture**\nThe lakehouse provides a unified architecture,\nmeaning that all data is stored in the same\naccessible place. The diagram shows how data\ncomes in from sources like a customer relationship\nmanagement (CRM) system, an enterprise resource\nplanning (ERP) system, websites or unstructured\ncustomer emails.\n\n**Optimize the storage layer**\nAll data is stored in cloud storage while Databricks\nprovides tooling to assist with ingestion, such as\nAuto Loader, and we recommend [open-source](https://delta.io/)\n[Delta Lake](https://docs.databricks.com/delta/index.html) as the storage format of choice.\nDelta optimized storage layer that provides the\nfoundation for storing data and tables in the\nDatabricks Lakehouse Platform. Having all your\ndata in the same optimized, open storage keeps\nall your use cases in the same place, thus enabling\ncollaboration and removing software tool overhead.\n\n\n\n-  the customer-owned infrastructure managed in\ncollaboration by Databricks and the customer.\n\n\nThe lakehouse handles all varieties of data (structured, semi-structured, unstructured),\nas well as all velocities of data (streaming, batch or somewhere in the middle).\n\n[Sign up for a free trial](https://www.databricks.com/try-databricks#account) account with the instructions on the [get started page.](https://docs.databricks.com/getting-started/index.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Databricks Lakehouse organizes data stored with Delta Lake in cloud object\nstorage with familiar concepts like database, tables and views. Delta Lake extends\nParquet data files with a file-based transaction log for [ACID transactions](https://docs.databricks.com/lakehouse/acid.html) and\nscalable metadata handling. Delta Lake is fully compatible with Apache Spark APIs,\nand was developed for tight integration with Structured Streaming, allowing you to\neasily use a single copy of data for both batch and streaming operations to provide\nincremental processing at scale.This model combines many of the benefits of a data\nwarehouse with the scalability and flexibility of a data lake.\n\nTo learn more about the optimized storage layer that provides the foundation for\nstoring data and tables in the Databricks Lakehouse Platform, see [Getting started](https://docs.databricks.com/getting-started/delta.html)\n[with Delta Lake](https://docs.databricks.com/getting-started/delta.html) [.](https://docs.databricks.com/getting-started/delta.html)\n\nThe first step in unifying your data architecture is setting up how data is to be\naccessed and used across the organization. We‚Äôll discuss this as a series of steps:\n\n**1** Set up governance with Unity Catalog\n\n**2** Grant secure access to the data\n\n\n###### ‚ÄúDelta Lake provides us with a single source of truth for all of our data,‚Äù said Stone. ‚ÄúNow our data engineers are able to build reliable data pipelines that thread the needle on key topics, such as inventory management, allowing us to identify in near real-time what our trends are so we can figure out how to effectively move inventory.‚Äù\n ‚Äì Jake Stone, Senior Manager,  Business Analytics at ButcherBox \n\n[Learn more](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/02/07/how-butcherbox-uses-data-insights-to-provide-quality-food-tailored-to-each-customers-unique-taste.html)\n\n\n**3** Capture audit logs\n\n**4** View data lineage\n\n**5** Set up data sharing\n\n\n-----\n\n**Configure unified governance**\nDatabricks recommends using catalogs to provide an easily searchable inventory of data, notebooks, dashboards and models. Often this\nmeans that catalogs can correspond to software development environment scope, team or business unit. [Unity Catalog](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/get-started.html) manages how data\nis secured, accessed and shared. Unity Catalog offers a single place to administer data access policies that apply across all workspace and\npersonas and automatically captures user-level audit logs that record access to your data.\n\nData stewards can securely grant access to a broad set of users to discover and analyze data at scale. These users can use a variety of\nlanguages and tools, including SQL and Python, to create derivative data sets, models and dashboards that can be shared across teams.\n\nTo set up Unity Catalog for your organization,\nyou do the following:\n\n\n**1** Configure an S3 bucket and IAM role that\nUnity Catalog can use to store and access\ndata in your AWS account.\n\n**2** Create a metastore for each region in\n\nwhich your organization operates, and\nattach workspaces to the metastore. Each\nworkspace will have the same view of the\ndata you manage in Unity Catalog.\n\n\n**3** If you have a new account, add users,\ngroups and service principals to your\nDatabricks account.\n\n**4** Next, create and grant access to\n\ncatalogs, schemas and tables.\n\n\nFor complete setup instructions, see [Get started using Unity Catalog.](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/get-started.html#:~:text=To%20enable%20your%20Databricks%20account%20to%20use%20Unity,Transfer%20your%20metastore%20admin%20role%20to%20a%20group.)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### How Unity  Catalog works\n\n\nYou will notice that the hierarchy of primary data\nobjects in Unity Catalog flows from metastore to table:\n\n**Metastore** is the top-level container for metadata.\nEach metastore exposes a three-level namespace\n(catalog.schema.table) that organizes your data.\n\n\n**Metastore** **Catalog** **Schemas**\n\n\n**Views**\n\n**Managed**\n**Tables**\n\n\n**Catalog** is the first layer of the object hierarchy, used\nto organize your data assets.\n\n\n**Schemas** , also known as databases, are the second\nlayer of the object hierarchy and contain tables and\nviews.\n\n**Table** is the lowest level in the object hierarchy, and\ntables can be external (stored in external locations in\nyour cloud storage of choice) or managed (stored in a\nstorage container in your cloud storage that you create\n\nexpressly for Databricks). You can also create readonly **Views** from tables.\n\n\n**External**\n**tables**\n\nThe diagram below represents the file system\nhierarchy of a single storage bucket:\n\n\n-----\n\nUnity Catalog uses the identities in the Databricks\naccount to resolve users, service principals, and groups\nand to enforce permissions. To configure identities in\nthe account, follow the instructions in [Manage users,](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/users-groups/index.html)\n[service principals, and groups](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/users-groups/index.html) . Refer to those users,\nservice principals, and groups when you create\n[access-control policies](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/manage-privileges/index.html) in Unity Catalog.\n\nUnity Catalog users, service principals, and groups\nmust also be added to workspaces to access Unity\nCatalog data in a notebook, a Databricks SQL query,\nData Explorer or a REST API command. The assignment\nof users, service principals, and groups to workspaces\nis called identity federation. All workspaces attached\nto a Unity Catalog metastore are enabled for identity\nfederation.\n\nSecurable objects in Unity Catalog are hierarchical,\nmeaning that granting a privilege on a catalog or schema\nautomatically grants the privilege to all current and\nfuture objects within the catalog or schema. For more\non granting privileges, see the [Inheritance model](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/manage-privileges/privileges.html#inheritance) .\nA common scenario is to set up a schema per team\nwhere only that team has USE SCHEMA and CREATE on\nthe schema. This means that any tables produced by\nteam members can only be shared within the team.\nData Explorer uses the privileges configured by Unity\nCatalog administrators to ensure that users are only\nable to see catalogs, databases, tables and views that\nthey have permission to query.\n\n\n[Databricks Data Explorer](https://docs.databricks.com/data/index.html) is the main user interface for\nmany Unity Catalog features. Use Data Explorer to view\nschema details, preview sample data, and see table\ndetails and properties. Administrators can view and\nchange owners. Admins and data object owners can grant\nand revoke permissions through this interface.\n\n**Set up secure access**\nIn Unity Catalog, data is secure by default. Initially, users\nhave no access to data in a metastore. Access can\nbe granted by either a metastore admin, the owner of\nan object, or the owner of the catalog or schema that\ncontains the object. Securable objects in Unity Catalog\nare hierarchical and privileges are inherited downward.\n\nUnity Catalog‚Äôs security model is based on standard ANSI\nSQL and allows administrators to grant permissions in\ntheir existing data lake using familiar syntax, at the level of\ncatalogs, databases (schema), tables and views. Privileges\nand metastores are shared across workspaces, allowing\nadministrators to set secure permissions once against\n\ngroups synced from identity providers and know that\nend users only have access to the proper data in any\nDatabricks workspace they enter.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nCUSTOMER STORY: BUTCHERBOX\n\n### How Butcherbox Uses Data Insights to Provide Quality Food Tailored to Each Customer‚Äôs Unique Taste\n\n```\n\nAs a young e-commerce company,\n\n[ButcherBox](https://www.butcherbox.com/) has to be nimble as its\n\ncustomers‚Äô needs change, which means it is\n\nconstantly considering behavioral patterns,\n\ndistribution center efficiency, a growing list of\n\nmarketing and communication channels, and\n\norder processing systems.\n\nThe meat and seafood subscription company\n\ncollects data on hundreds of thousands\n\nof subscribers. It deployed the Databricks\n\nLakehouse Platform to gain visibility across\n\nits diverse range of data systems and enable\n\nits analytics team to securely view and\n\nexport data in the formats needed.\n\nWith so much data feeding in from different\n\nsources ‚Äî from email systems to its website\n\n‚Äî the data team at ButcherBox quickly\n\ndiscovered that data silos were a significant\n\n\n‚ÄúWe knew we needed to migrate from our legacy data warehouse\n\nenvironment to a data analytics platform that would unify our\n\ndata and make it easily accessible for quick analysis to improve\n\nsupply chain operations, forecast demand and, most importantly,\n\nkeep up with our growing customer base,‚Äù explained Jake Stone,\n\nSenior Manager, Business Analytics, at ButcherBox.\n\nThe platform allows analysts to share builds and iterate on a\n\nproject without getting into the code. Querying a table of 18\n\nbillion rows would have been problematic with a traditional\n\nplatform. With Databricks, ButcherBox can do it in three minutes.\n\n‚ÄúDelta Lake provides us with a single source of truth for all of\n\nour data,‚Äù said Stone. ‚ÄúNow our data engineers are able to build\n\nreliable data pipelines that thread the needle on key topics such\n\nas inventory management, allowing us to identify in near real-\n\ntime what our trends are so we can figure out how to effectively\n\nmove inventory.‚Äù\n\n[Read the full story here.](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/02/07/how-butcherbox-uses-data-insights-to-provide-quality-food-tailored-to-each-customers-unique-taste.html)\n\n\nproblem because they blocked complete\n\nvisibility into critical insights needed to make\n\nstrategic and marketing decisions.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Set up secure data sharing**\nDatabricks uses an open protocol called [Delta Sharing](https://docs.databricks.com/data-sharing/index.html)\nto share data with other entities regardless of their\ncomputing platforms. Delta Sharing is integrated with\nUnity Catalog. Your data must be registered with Unity\nCatalog to manage, govern, audit and track usage of the\nshared data on the Lakehouse Platform. The primary\nconcepts of Delta Sharing are shares (read-only\ncollections of tables and table partitions to be shared)\nand recipients (objects that associate an organization\nwith a credential or secure sharing identifier).\n\nAs a data provider, you generate a token and share\nit securely with the recipient. They use the token to\nauthenticate and get read access to the tables you‚Äôve\nincluded in the shares you‚Äôve given them access\nto. Recipients access the shared data in read-only\nformat. Whenever the data provider updates data\ntables in their own Databricks account, the updates\nappear in near real-time in the recipient‚Äôs system.\n\n\n**Capture audit logs**\nUnity Catalog captures an audit log of actions\nperformed against the metastore. To access audit\nlogs for Unity Catalog events, you must enable and\nconfigure audit logs for your account. Audit logs for\neach workspace and account-level activities are\ndelivered to your account. See how to [configure audit](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/audit.html)\n[logs](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/audit.html) and create a dashboard to analyze audit log data.\n\n**View data lineage**\nYou can use Unity Catalog to capture runtime data\nlineage across queries in any language executed on\na Databricks cluster or SQL warehouse. Lineage can\nbe visualized in Data Explorer in near real-time and\nretrieved with the Databricks REST API. Lineage is\naggregated across all workspaces attached to Unity\nCatalog and captured down to the column level, and\nincludes notebooks, workflows and dashboards related\nto the query. To understand the requirements and how\nto capture lineage data, see [Capture and view data](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/data-lineage.html)\n[lineage with Unity Catalog](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/data-lineage.html) .\n\n\nUnity Catalog Metastore\n\n\nCatalog\n\n\nData providers can use Databricks audit logging to\nmonitor the creation and modification of shares,\nand recipients can monitor recipient activity on\nshares. Data recipients who use shared data in a\nDatabricks account can use Databricks audit logging\nto understand who is accessing which data.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Resources:\n\n-  [Databricks documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/?_ga=2.8076210.1659353804.1668454132-1193545868.1666711643)\n\n-  [Getting Started With Delta Lake](https://docs.databricks.com/delta/index.html)\n\n-  [Webinar: Deep Dive Into Lakehouse With Delta Lake](https://www.databricks.com/p/webinar/deep-dive-into-lakehouse-with-delta-lake-complimentary-training)\n\n-  [Big Book of Data Engineering Use Cases](https://www.databricks.com/explore/de-data-warehousing/big-book-of-data-engineering#page=1)\n\n-  [10 Powerful Features to Simplify Semi-structured](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2021/11/11/10-powerful-features-to-simplify-semi-structured-data-management-in-the-databricks-lakehouse.html)\n[Data Management in the Databricks Lakehouse](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2021/11/11/10-powerful-features-to-simplify-semi-structured-data-management-in-the-databricks-lakehouse.html)\n\n\n###### Key Takeaways\n\n-  With the Databricks Lakehouse Platform, you can\nunify and simplify all your data on one platform\nto better scale and improve data storage and\nquery capabilities\n\n-  The lakehouse helps reduce data infrastructure\nand compute costs.

This inevitably leads to\nthe increasing complexity of data architecture as new storage and access patterns emerge. Data growth can come\nsuddenly and unexpectedly, when it does, the existing architecture needs to sustain performance, all the while being\ncost-effective.

You can use all languages\nsupported by Databricks to define production jobs, and\nnotebooks can leverage a combination of languages.\n\nThis means that you can promote queries written by\nSQL analysts for last-mile ETL into production data\nengineering code with almost no effort. Queries and\nworkloads defined by personas across the organization\nleverage the same data sets, so there‚Äôs no need to\nreconcile field names or make sure dashboards are up\nto date before sharing code and results with\nother teams.\n\n\n-----\n\nWith [Delta Live Tables](https://www.databricks.com/product/delta-live-tables) (DLT), data professionals have\na framework that uses a simple declarative approach\nto build ETL and ML pipelines on batch or streaming\ndata while automating operational complexities such\nas infrastructure management, task orchestration,\nerror handling and recovery, retries, and performance\noptimization.\n\nDelta Live Tables extends functionality in Apache Spark\nStructured Streaming and allows you to write just a\nfew lines of declarative Python or SQL to deploy a\nproduction-quality data pipeline with:\n\n-  [Autoscaling compute infrastructure](https://docs.databricks.com/workflows/delta-live-tables/delta-live-tables-concepts.html#auto-scaling) for cost savings\n\n-  Data quality checks with [expectations](https://docs.databricks.com/workflows/delta-live-tables/delta-live-tables-expectations.html)\n\n-  Automatic [schema evolution](https://docs.databricks.com/ingestion/auto-loader/schema.html) handling\n\n-  Monitoring via metrics in the [event log](https://docs.databricks.com/workflows/delta-live-tables/delta-live-tables-event-log.html)\n\nWith DLT, engineers can also treat their data as code\nand apply software engineering best practices like\ntesting, monitoring and documentation to deploy\nreliable pipelines at scale. You can easily define end-toend data pipelines in SQL or Python and automatically\nmaintain all data dependencies across the pipeline and\nreuse ETL pipelines with environment-independent\ndata management.\n\n```\nCUSTOMER STORY: ABNORMAL SECURITY\n\n### Stopping sophisticated  ransomware in its tracks\n\n```\n```\nCUSTOMER STORY: ABNORMAL SECURITY\n\n```\n\nThe increase in email phishing and ransomware attacks requires the type of protection that can scale and evolve\n\nto meet the challenges of modern cyberattacks. [Abnormal Security](https://abnormalsecurity.com/) , a cloud-native email security provider, knew\n\nthat scalability would become a major focus to stay ahead of attack strategies with frequent product updates.\n\nAbnormal also required a data analytics infrastructure robust enough to meet the scale requirements for its data\n\npipelines and constantly refined ML models.\n\n‚ÄúWe were spending too much time managing our Spark infrastructure,‚Äù said Carlos Gasperi, Software Engineer at\n\nAbnormal Security. ‚ÄúWhat we needed to be doing with that time was building the pipelines that would make the\n\nproduct better.‚Äù\n\nThe company implemented the Databricks Lakehouse Platform, which simplified its data architecture and\n\nmaximized the performance of data pipelines and analytics. Data practitioners are now able to ingest data\n\ndirectly from S3 and query it in near real-time with the help of Delta Lake, an open-format storage layer that\n\ndelivers reliability, security and performance on the data lake for both streaming and batch operations.

DevOps practices\nand tooling alone are insufficient because ML\napplications rely on an assortment of artifacts (e.g.,\nmodels, data, code) that can each require different\nmethods of experiment tracking, model training,\nfeature development, governance, feature and\nmodel serving.\n\nFor data teams beginning their machine learning\njourneys, the challenge of training data models can\nbe labor-intensive and not cost-effective because\nthe data has to be converted into features and\n\ntrained on a separate machine learning platform\n\n\nData teams often perform development in\ndisjointed, siloed stacks spanning DataOps,\nModelOps and DevOps\n\nDevelopment and training environment\ndisconnect. Moving code and data between\npersonal development environments and\nmachine learning platforms for model training\nat scale is error prone and cumbersome. The\n‚Äúit worked on my machine‚Äù problem.\n\nGathering high-quality data. Data that is siloed\nacross the organization is hard to discover,\ncollect, clean and use. This leads to stale data\nand delays in development of models.\n\n\nSee **Create a unified data architecture.**\n```\n                                                     03\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n###### Siloed stacks spanning  DataOps, ModelOps and DevOps\n\nWhen data engineers help ingest, refine and prep\ndata, they do so on their own stack. This data has\nto be converted into features and then trained on\na separate machine learning platform. This cross-\nplatform handoff often results in data staleness,\ndifficulty in maintaining versions, and eventually,\npoorly performing models. Even after you have\ntrained your model, you have to deal with yet another\ntech stack for model deployment. It‚Äôs challenging\nto serve features in real time and difficult to trace\nproblems in production back to the data.\n\nThe downstream business impact is massive ‚Äî\nlonger and more expensive projects, and lower\nmodel accuracy in production leading to declining\nbusiness metrics.\n\nIf you are looking at launching or scaling your\nMLOps, you should probably focus on an incremental\nstrategy. At Databricks, we see firsthand how\ncustomers develop their MLOps approaches across\na huge variety of teams and businesses. [Check out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JApPzAnbfPI)\n[this Data +AI Summit session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JApPzAnbfPI) to learn more about\nbuilding robust MLOps practices.\n\n\n###### Databricks solution:\n\nDatabricks Machine Learning is an integrated\nend-to-end machine learning environment\nincorporating managed services for experiment\ntracking, model training, feature development and\nmanagement, and model serving. The capabilities\nof Databricks map directly to the steps of model\ndevelopment and deployment. With Databricks\nMachine Learning, you can:\n\n\nTrain models either manually or with AutoML\n\nTrack training parameters and models using\nexperiments with MLflow tracking\n\nCreate feature tables and access them for model\ntraining and inference\n\nShare, manage and serve models using MLflow\nModel Registry\n\nDeploy models for Serverless Real-time Inference\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Use MLOps on  the Databricks  Lakehouse Platform\n\nTo gain efficiencies and reduce costs, many smaller\ndigital companies are employing machine learning\noperations. MLOps is a set of processes and\nautomation for managing models, data and code, and\nunique library dependencies to improve performance\nstability and long-term efficiency in ML systems.\n\nTo describe it simply, MLOps = ModelOps + DataOps +\nDevOps. The aim of MLOps is to improve the long-term\nperformance, stability and success rate of ML systems\nwhile maximizing the efficiency of the teams who\nbuild them.\n\n\nNot only does MLOps improve organizational efficiency,\nit also allows the models to iterate faster and react\nto real-life changes in the data. This ability separates\ncompanies that can grow to meet their customer‚Äôs\nchallenges in a reactive manner versus those that will\nspend significant time on data updates/processes and\nmiss the opportunity to do something with\ntheir models.\n\nThe absence of MLOps is typically marked by an\noverabundance of manual processes which are slower\n\n\nand more prone to error, affecting the quality of models, data and code. Eventually they form a bottleneck,\ncapping the ability for a data team to take on new projects. The process is complex. In larger organizations,\nseveral specialists and stakeholders can be involved in one ML project. But data practitioners at smaller digital\nnatives and high-growth startups may be forced to wear several hats.\n\n\n-----\n\nAnd once an ML project goes into production, the\nMLOps continues, since the models, data and code\nchange over time due to regulatory and business\nrequirements. But the ML system must be resilient and\nflexible. Addressing these challenges with a defined\nMLOps strategy can dramatically reduce the iteration\ncycle of delivering models to production.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Steps in machine learning model development and deployment:\n\n\n**Step 1**\n**Data preparation**\nManually preparing and labeling data is a thankless,\ntime-consuming job. With Databricks, teams can\nlabel data with human effort, machine learning\nmodels in Databricks, or a combination of both.\nTeams can also employ a [model-assisted labeling](https://labelbox.com/product/automation )\nworkflow that allows humans to easily inspect and\ncorrect a model‚Äôs predicted labels. This process can\ndrastically reduce the amount of unstructured data\nyou need to achieve strong model performance.\n\nThe [Databricks Runtime for Machine Learning](https://docs.databricks.com/runtime/mlruntime.html) is a\nready-to-go environment with many external\nlibraries, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, Horovod,\nscikit-learn and XGBoost. It provides\nextensions to improve performance, including GPU\nacceleration in XGBoost, distributed deep\nlearning using HorovodRunner, and model\ncheckpointing.\n\nTo use Databricks Runtime ML, select the ML version\nof the runtime when you [create your cluster](https://docs.databricks.com/clusters/index.html) . To\naccess data in Unity Catalog for machine learning\nworkflows, you must use a [single user cluster](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/compute.html) . User\nisolation clusters are not compatible with Databricks\nRuntime for Machine Learning.\n\n\nMachine learning applications often\nneed to use shared storage for data\nloading and model checkpointing. You\ncan load tabular data from [tables](https://docs.databricks.com/lakehouse/data-objects.html#table) or\nfiles. A table is a collection of\nstructured data stored as a directory\non cloud object storage.\n\nFor [data preprocessing](https://docs.databricks.com/machine-learning/preprocess-data/index.html) , you can\nuse [Databricks Feature Store](https://docs.databricks.com/machine-learning/feature-store/index.html) to create\nnew features, explore and reuse\nexisting features, track lineage and\nfeature creation code, and publish\nfeatures to low-latency online stores\nfor real-time inference. The Feature\nStore is a centralized repository\nthat enables data scientists to find\nand share features. It ensures that\nthe same code used to compute\nthe feature values is used for model\ntraining and inference. The Feature\nStore library is available only on\nDatabricks Runtime for Machine\nLearning and is accessible through\nDatabricks notebooks and workflows.\n\n\n###### Resources:\n\n-  [The Comprehensive Guide to Feature Stores](https://www.databricks.com/resources/ebook/the-comprehensive-guide-to-feature-stores)\n\n-  [Load data for machine learning and deep learning](https://docs.databricks.com/machine-learning/load-data/index.html)\n\n-  [Preprocess data for machine learning and](https://docs.databricks.com/machine-learning/preprocess-data/index.html)\n[deep learning](https://docs.databricks.com/machine-learning/preprocess-data/index.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nC `USTOMER STORY: ZIPLINE`\n\n### Data-driven drones deliver lifesaving medical aid around the world\n\n\nAutomated logistics and delivery system\n\nprovider [Zipline](https://www.flyzipline.com/ ) is redefining logistics by using\n\ncutting-edge drone technology and a global\n\nautonomous logistics network to save lives\n\n\ninformation they need to accurately measure success, find\n\nthe metrics that relate to customer experiences or logistics,\n\nand improve on them exponentially as more data is ingested\n\nand machine learning models are refined.\n\n\nby giving remote communities access to\n\n\nemergency and preparatory medical aid and\n\nresources, regardless of where they are in the\n\nworld.\n\nDoing so requires the ability to ingest and\n\nanalyze huge chunks of time series data in real\n\ntime. This data is produced every time a drone\n\ntakes flight and includes performance data,\n\nin-flight battery management, regional weather\n\npatterns, geographic obstacles, landing errors\n\nand a litany of other information that must be\n\nprocessed.\n\n\n‚ÄúAbout 30% of the deliveries we do are lifesaving emergency\n\ndeliveries, where the product being delivered does not exist\n\nat the hospital.

Databricks\nnotebooks provide real-time coauthoring in multiple\nlanguages, automatic versioning and built-in data\nvisualizations.\n\n\n###### Resources:\n\n-  [Model training examples](https://docs.databricks.com/machine-learning/train-model/index.html)\n\n-  [Training models with Feature Store](https://docs.databricks.com/machine-learning/feature-store/train-models-with-feature-store.html)\n\n-  [Best practices for deep learning on Databricks](https://docs.databricks.com/machine-learning/feature-store/train-models-with-feature-store.html)\n\n-  [Machine learning quickstart notebook](https://docs.databricks.com/machine-learning/train-model/ml-quickstart.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Resources:\n\n-  [MLflow quickstart (Python)](https://docs.databricks.com/_extras/notebooks/source/mlflow/mlflow-quick-start-python.html)\n\n-  [Track machine learning training runs](https://docs.databricks.com/mlflow/tracking.html)\n\n-  [Automatically log training runs to MLflow](https://docs.databricks.com/mlflow/quick-start-python.html#automatically-log-training-runs-to-mlflow)\n\n-  [Track ML Model training data with Delta Lake](https://docs.databricks.com/mlflow/tracking-ex-delta.html)\n\n-  [Log, load, register, and deploy MLflow models](https://docs.databricks.com/mlflow/models.html)\n\n\n**Step 3**\n**Track model development**\nThe model development process is iterative, and can\nbe challenging. You can use [MLflow tracking](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html) to help\nyou keep track of the model development process,\nincluding parameter settings or combinations you have\ntried and how they affected the model‚Äôs performance.\n\nMLflow tracking uses experiments and runs to log\nand track your model development. A run is a single\nexecution of model code. An experiment is a collection\nof related runs. Within an experiment, you can compare\nand filter runs to understand how your model performs\nand how its performance depends on the parameter\nsettings, input data, etc.\n\nMLflow can automatically log training code written\nin many ML frameworks. This is the easiest way to\nget started using MLflow tracking. With MLflow‚Äôs\nautologging capabilities, a single line of code\nautomatically logs the resulting model.\n\n\nA hosted version of MLflow Model Registry can help\n[manage the full lifecycle](https://docs.databricks.com/machine-learning/manage-model-lifecycle/index.html) of MLflow models. You can\napply webhooks to automatically trigger actions based\non registry events. For example, you can trigger CI\nbuilds when a new model version is created or notify\nyour team members through Slack each time a model\ntransition to production is requested. This promotes\na traceable version control work process. You can\nleverage this feature for web traffic A/B testing and\nfunneled to versions of deployed models for more\nprecise population studies.\n\n\n**Step 4**\n**Deploy machine learning models**\nYou can use MLflow to deploy models for batch or\nstreaming inference or to set up a REST endpoint to\nserve the model. Simplify your model deployment by\nregistering models to [the MLflow Model Registry](https://docs.databricks.com/mlflow/model-registry.html) . After\nyou have registered your model, you can [automatically](https://docs.databricks.com/machine-learning/manage-model-lifecycle/index.html#generate-inference-nb)\n[generate a notebook](https://docs.databricks.com/machine-learning/manage-model-lifecycle/index.html#generate-inference-nb) for batch inference or configure\nthe model for online serving with Serverless RealTime Inference or [Classic MLflow Model Serving on](https://docs.databricks.com/archive/classic-model-serving/model-serving.html)\n\n[Databricks](https://docs.databricks.com/archive/classic-model-serving/model-serving.html) .

These assets need to be developed\n(dev), tested (staging) and deployed (production).\nEach stage needs to operate within an execution\nenvironment. So the execution environments, code,\nmodels and data are divided into dev, staging and\nproduction.\n\nML project code is often stored in a version control\nrepository (such as Git), with most organizations using\nbranches corresponding to the lifecycle phases of\ndevelopment, staging or production.\n\nSince model lifecycles do not correspond one-toone with code lifecycles, it makes sense for model\nmanagement to have its own service. MLflow and its\nModel Registry support managing model artifacts\ndirectly via UI and APIs. The loose coupling of model\nartifacts and code provides flexibility to update\nproduction models without code changes, streamlining\nthe deployment process in many cases.\n\nDatabricks recommends creating separate\nenvironments for the different stages of ML code and\nmodel development with clearly defined transitions\nbetween stages. The recommended MLOps workflow is\nbroken into these three stages:\n\n\n[Development](https://docs.databricks.com/machine-learning/mlops/mlops-workflow.html#development-stage) ‚Äî The focus of the development stage\nis experimentation. Data scientists develop features\nand models and run experiments to optimize model\nperformance. The output of the development process is\nML pipeline code that can include feature computation,\nmodel training inference and monitoring\n\n\n-----\n\n[Staging](https://docs.databricks.com/machine-learning/mlops/mlops-workflow.html#staging-stage)\nThis stage focuses on testing the ML pipeline code\nfor production readiness, including code for model\ntraining as well as feature engineering pipelines and\ninference code. The output of the staging process is a\nrelease branch that triggers the CI/CD system to start\nthe production stage.\n\n\n-----\n\n[Production](https://docs.databricks.com/machine-learning/mlops/mlops-workflow.html#production-stage)\nML engineers own the production environment\nwhere ML pipelines are deployed. These pipelines\ncompute fresh feature values, train and test new model\nversions, publish predictions to downstream tables\nor applications, and monitor the entire process to\navoid performance degradation and instability. Data\nscientists have visibility to test results, logs, model\nartifacts and production pipeline status to allow them\nto identify and diagnose problems in production.\n\nThe Databricks Machine Learning home page provides\nquick access to all the machine learning resources.

The methods and processes used to approach the development, release and optimization of products and capital spend are the foundation of the industry‚Äôs evolution.\n\n\nBut today it‚Äôs data- and AI-driven businesses that\nare being rewarded because they‚Äôre using process\nand product optimization not previously possible,\nable to forecast and sense supply chain demand,\nand, crucially, introduce new forms of revenue\nbased upon service rather than product.\n\nThe drivers for this evolution will be the emergence\nof what we refer to as ‚ÄúIntelligent Manufacturing‚Äù\nthat has been enabled by the rise of computational\npower at the Edge and in the Cloud. As well as\nnew levels of connectivity speed enabled by 5G\nand fiber optic, combined with increased use of\nadvanced analytics and machine learning (ML).\n\n\nYet, even with all the technological advances\nenabling these new data-driven businesses,\nchallenges exist.\n\nMcKinsey‚Äôs recent research with the World\nEconomic Forum estimates the value creation\npotential of manufacturers and suppliers that\nimplement Industry 4.0 in their operations\nat USD$37 trillion by 2025. Truly a huge number.\nBut the challenge that most companies still\nstruggle with is the move from piloting point\nsolutions to delivering sustainable impact at scale.\n[Only 30% of companies are capturing value from](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/advanced%20electronics/our%20insights/capturing%20value%20at%20scale%20in%20discrete%20manufacturing%20with%20industry%204%200/industry-4-0-capturing-value-at-scale-in-discrete-manufacturing-vf.pdf)\n[Industry 4.0 solutions in manufacturing today.](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/advanced%20electronics/our%20insights/capturing%20value%20at%20scale%20in%20discrete%20manufacturing%20with%20industry%204%200/industry-4-0-capturing-value-at-scale-in-discrete-manufacturing-vf.pdf)\n\n\n##### 80% of manufacturers\n[see smart manufacturing as](https://roboticsandautomationnews.com/2021/03/10/new-study-reveals-80-percent-of-manufacturers-see-smart-manufacturing-as-key-to-future-success/41322/)\n[key to their future success](https://roboticsandautomationnews.com/2021/03/10/new-study-reveals-80-percent-of-manufacturers-see-smart-manufacturing-as-key-to-future-success/41322/)\n\n##### 57% of manufacturing leaders feel their organization\n[lacks skilled workers to support](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-05-11-gartner-survey-shows-57-percent-of-manufacturing-leaders-feel-their-organization-lacks-skilled-workers-to-support-smart-manufacturing-digitization-plans)\n[their smart manufacturing plans](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-05-11-gartner-survey-shows-57-percent-of-manufacturing-leaders-feel-their-organization-lacks-skilled-workers-to-support-smart-manufacturing-digitization-plans)\n\n[A lack of supply chain](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/energy-resources/us-2021-manufacturing-industry-outlook.pdf)\n[integration could stall smart](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/energy-resources/us-2021-manufacturing-industry-outlook.pdf)\n[factory initiatives for](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/energy-resources/us-2021-manufacturing-industry-outlook.pdf) **[3 in 5](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/energy-resources/us-2021-manufacturing-industry-outlook.pdf)**\n##### manufacturers by 2025\n\n\n3 Four Forces Driving Intelligent Manufacturing\n\n\n-----\n\n## The four driving forces of change\n\n###### Over the last two years, demand imbalances and supply chain swings have added a sense of urgency for manufacturers to digitally transform. But in truth, the main challenges facing the industry have existed, and will continue to exist, outside these recent exceptional circumstances. Manufacturers will always strive for greater levels of visibility across their supply chain, always seek to optimize and streamline operations to improve margins. In the continuing quest for improved efficiency, productivity, adaptability and resilience, manufacturers are commonly tackling these major challenges:\n\n\n###### Skills and production gaps\n\nThe rise of the digital economy is demanding a new set of skills.\nFor today‚Äôs Intelligent Manufacturing organizations, there‚Äôs a fundamental\nneed for computer and programming skills for automation, along\nwith critical-thinking abilities. Also important is the ability to use\ncollaboration systems and new advanced assistance tools, such as\nautomation, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). The deficit\nof workers with these skills is of critical concern to manufacturers.\n\nIn addition, the industry dynamics are pushing companies to increase\nand refine both partner/supplier relationships, optimize internal\noperations and build robust supply chains that do not rely upon\nsafety stock to weather supply chain swings. Historical focus on\noperational use cases is now extending to building agile supply chains.\n\n###### Supply chain volatility\n\nIf the events of the last few years proved anything, it‚Äôs that supply\nchains need to be robust and resilient. Historically, supply chain volatility\nwas smoothed by holding ‚Äúsafety stock,‚Äù which added costs without\nfinancial value. Then the pendulum swung to ‚Äújust in time delivery,‚Äù\nwhere efficient use of working capital disregarded demand risks.\n\nRecent experiences have highlighted that demand sensing is needed\nin addition to safety stock for high-risk parts or raw materials. The ability\nto monitor, predict and respond to external factors ‚Äì including natural\ndisasters, shipping and warehouse constraints, and geopolitical disruption\n‚Äì is vital to reduce risk and promote agility. Many of these external\ndata sources leverage unstructured data (news, social posts, videos\nand images), and being able to manage both structured and unstructured\ndata available to measure and analyze this volatility is key.\n\n\n###### Need for new and additional sources of revenue\n\nManufacturers‚Äô growth historically has been limited\nto new product introduction rate or expansion into\nnew geographies. The emergence of ‚Äúequipment\nas-a-service‚Äù is changing that dynamic. It‚Äôs pivoting\nthe business from product-centric growth to one\nleveraging added services, which are not slaves to the\nproduct development introduction cycle and can be highly\ndifferentiated depending on the market segment and types\nof products. Real-time data plays an outsize role, as now\nbusinesses are in unison with use cases such as predictive\nmaintenance, stock replenishment and worker safety.\n\n###### An increased focus on sustainability\n\nManufacturers have always focused on efficiency,\nbut they‚Äôre increasingly seeing the value chain as circular.\nIt‚Äôs no longer enough to consider an organization‚Äôs own\ncarbon footprint ‚Äì it needs to also include indirect\nemissions and other environmental impacts from the\nactivities it doesn‚Äôt own or control. This requires a\n360-degree view of sustainability, which includes both\ninternal and external factors in measuring compliance\nwith ESG programs.\n\n**This eBook will look closer at these four key challenges**\n**and their associated use cases, as well as some**\n**of the most effective technologies and solutions**\n**that can be implemented to respond to them.**\n\n\n4 Four Forces Driving Intelligent Manufacturing\n\n\n-----\n\n## Digital transformation is not a destination, it‚Äôs a journey\n\n##### Digitalization is reshaping many areas of manufacturing and logistics, product design, production and quality of goods as well as sustainability and energy output.\n\nThis transition from manual operations to automated\nsolutions is enhancing and optimizing operational\nefficiency and decision-making, while also making\nsupply chains more frictionless and reliable, as well\nas enabling organizations to become more responsive\nand adaptable to market and customer needs.\n\nThis disruption has been driven by a rush of new\ntechnologies including artificial intelligence, machine\nlearning, advanced analytics, digital twins, Internet\nof Things (IoT), and automation. These, in turn, have\nbeen enabled by the greater network capabilities of 5G.\nIndustry 4.0 is well underway.

Without this ability to\ncontrol the vast amounts of structured data (highly\norganized and easily decipherable) and unstructured\ndata (qualitative, no predefined data model),\nmanufacturers cannot generate actionable insights\nfrom their data, derive value from machine learning,\nmonitor and analyze supply chains, or coordinate\ndecisions across the business.\n\n\n**15**\n\n\n**14**\n\n\nMarketing & Sales\n\nService\n\n\n**19**\n\n\n**18**\n\n\n**23**\n\n\n**22**\n**21**\n**20**\n\n\nAwareness\n\n\nExploration Optimization Transformation\n\nMaturity Stages\n\n\n6 Four Forces Driving Intelligent Manufacturing\n\n\n-----\n\n## The foundations for data-driven manufacturing\n\n###### Cloud-native platforms\n\nImprove data management, enhance data analytics\nand expand the use of enterprise data, including streaming\nstructured and unstructured data\n\n###### Technology-enabled collaboration\n\nDemocratize analytics and ML capabilities ‚Äì ensure the right\nusers have access to the right data driving business value\n\n###### The ability to scale machine learning use cases\n\nA central place to store and discover ML models and enabling\ngreater collaboration between ML, data and business users\n\n\n##### 95% agree that\n[digital transformation](https://www.fictiv.com/ebooks/2021-state-of-manufacturing?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=column&utm_campaign=som21&utm_content=report)\n[in manufacturing](https://www.fictiv.com/ebooks/2021-state-of-manufacturing?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=column&utm_campaign=som21&utm_content=report)\n[is essential to their](https://www.fictiv.com/ebooks/2021-state-of-manufacturing?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=column&utm_campaign=som21&utm_content=report)\n[company‚Äôs future success](https://www.fictiv.com/ebooks/2021-state-of-manufacturing?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=column&utm_campaign=som21&utm_content=report)\n\n\n[Global spending on](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS48372321)\n[digital transformation](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS48372321)\n[is forecast to reach](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS48372321)\n##### USD$2.8 trillion by 2025\n\n\n##### 85% have accelerated\n[their digital transformation](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/what-800-executives-envision-for-the-postpandemic-workforce)\n[strategies since 2020](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/what-800-executives-envision-for-the-postpandemic-workforce)\n\n\n###### Open standards and open data architectures\n\nLeverage open source standards and open data formats\nto accelerate innovation and enable the integration\nof best-of-breed, third-party tools and services\n\n\n7 Four Forces Driving Intelligent Manufacturing\n\n\n-----\n\n### Driving Force No. 1\n\n## The shift from manufacturing to Intelligent Manufacturing\n\n##### If left unaddressed, a Deloitte study calculates that the manufacturing skills gap will leave 2.1 million jobs unfilled by 2030, costing the U.S. economy up to $1 trillion . The immediate response would be to point the finger at the pandemic. Indeed, the same study found that approximately 1.4 million positions were lost at the start of the pandemic, and only 63% of those have since been recouped.\n\n\nYet the reasons for the lack of manufacturing\ntalent today are manifold, and COVID-19 has only\ncontributed to an existing problem. For instance,\nmany highly experienced baby boomers are\nretiring from the workforce, leaving fewer people\nwith the in-depth knowledge of custom equipment\nand machines. Meanwhile, younger generations\nhave a poor perception of what manufacturing jobs\nare like and are reluctant to step into the industry.\nMeaning not only a problem with retaining skills,\nbut also attracting them.\n\nAnd, of course, there is a growing gap between\nthe current capabilities of industrial workers and\nthe skill sets needed for today‚Äôs data-driven,\nsensor-filled, 5G-enabled Intelligent Manufacturing.\n\n\nWith the drive to optimize operations, stabilize\nsupply chains and reinvent business models\nthrough equipment-as-a-service, the skill sets\nhave radically changed from even a decade ago.\n\nIntelligent Manufacturing‚Äôs use cases are placing\na high demand on robotics programmers and\ntechnicians, cybersecurity experts, digital twin\narchitects, supply network analysts, and people\nwho can leverage AI and machine learning\nalgorithms because deployment of these common\nuse cases is producing multiples of returns for\nthose embracing Intelligent Manufacturing.\n\n\n8 Four Forces Driving Intelligent Manufacturing\n\n\n-----\n\n### Those manufacturers with a strategy for upskilling existing talent, while also changing the perception of the incoming workforce, need to take advantage of the following use cases:\n\n\n##### 44% report difficulty\n[hiring manufacturing](https://www.fictiv.com/ebooks/2021-state-of-manufacturing?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=column&utm_campaign=som21&utm_content=report)\n[talent with the required](https://www.fictiv.com/ebooks/2021-state-of-manufacturing?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=column&utm_campaign=som21&utm_content=report)\n[digital expertise](https://www.fictiv.com/ebooks/2021-state-of-manufacturing?utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=column&utm_campaign=som21&utm_content=report)\n\n##### 83% of manufacturing workers are interested\n[in learning new digital skills](https://www.mendix.com/press/welcome-news-to-jumpstart-the-post-pandemic-economy-mendix-survey-shows-78-of-u-s-manufacturing-workers-want-to-help-with-digital-transformation/)\n\n##### 56% of Gen Z say\n[that the pandemic has](https://skillsgapp.com/how-the-pandemic-shifted-gen-zs-perception-of-manufacturing-careers/)\n[changed their perception](https://skillsgapp.com/how-the-pandemic-shifted-gen-zs-perception-of-manufacturing-careers/)\n[of manufacturing. 77% now](https://skillsgapp.com/how-the-pandemic-shifted-gen-zs-perception-of-manufacturing-careers/)\n[view it as more important](https://skillsgapp.com/how-the-pandemic-shifted-gen-zs-perception-of-manufacturing-careers/)\n\n### Proof through customer success\n\n##### Watch our case study\n\n\n###### Digital twins\n\nIngesting information from sensors and other data sources,\nthese virtual replicas of physical assets create models\nto which a layer of visualization can be applied. This enables\nusers to predict failures, assess performance and reveal\nopportunities for optimization. Digital twins unlock the ability\nfor manufacturers to monitor and manage production remotely,\nas well as explore ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù scenarios.\n\n###### Process and quality optimization\n\nProcess and quality optimization generally covers the\noptimization of equipment, operating procedures, and control\nloops. It requires access to accurate, up-to-date data about\nconditions, collected through IoT devices to monitor every\naspect. The introduction of deep learning architectures is\nenabling manufacturing machinery to identify visual clues\nthat are indicative of quality issues in manufactured goods,\nwhile digital twins can be used to spot inefficiencies without\nthe need to pause production.\n\n###### Throughput optimization\n\nIncreasing throughput is critical for meeting delivery schedules,\nand manufacturers are always looking for ways to identify\nand eliminate bottlenecks, reduce inventory and increase\nthe utilization of assets. Throughput optimization makes\nuse of data-driven algorithms to identify, rank and resolve\nlabor, equipment or inventory bottlenecks.\n\n\n###### Equipment predictive maintenance\n\nRather than wait for a piece of equipment to fail or\nstick to a fixed schedule, predictive maintenance adopts\na predictive approach to equipment maintenance.\nBy monitoring real-time data collected from hundreds\nof IoT sensors, machine learning techniques can detect\nanomalies in operations and possible defects in equipment\nand processes.

In the short term, this meant having to adapt to global lockdowns and restrictions, material shortages and compromised workforces. Longer term, there will be economic downturns and new consumer and customer demands and habits to contend with. Resilience and end-to-end visibility are key, with manufacturers given a harsh reminder of how important it is to be able to forecast and respond to disruption.\n\n\nSuch resiliency requires a combination\nof technologies and solutions. For example,\ndecision support tools with predictive capabilities\n‚Äì to monitor the supply chain and analyze\nwhat-if scenarios. Demand sensing and forecasting\nin combination with enterprise critical systems\n(ERP) needs to combine data from a wide variety\nof sources.\n\n10 Four Forces Driving Intelligent Manufacturing\n\n\nWorking together, combining millions of data points\nfrom across organizations‚Äô operations along with\nother external sources, these technologies can\nbe used to optimize supply chains, reduce costs\nand improve customer service and loyalty.\nHowever, achieving this ‚Äì embracing the latest\nin AI, machine learning and predictive analytics ‚Äì\nmeans being able to manage and maintain\na flow of accurate, relevant data and to be able\nto translate this data into actionable insights.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Successful supply chain optimization depends on up-to-the-minute, end-to-end visibility that can be applied across all stages of the supply chain, from design to planning to execution. This will incorporate a range of solutions that can include:\n\n\n###### Demand, inventory, logistics\n\n\n###### Purchasing\n\n**Spend analytics:** Most obviously, transparency and insight into where\ncash is spent is vital for identifying opportunities to reduce external\nspending across supply markets, suppliers and locations. However, spend\nanalytics are also hugely important to supply chain agility and resilience.\nThis requires a single source of data truth for finance and procurement\ndepartments. For example, integrating purchase order, invoice,\naccounts payable, and general-ledger account data to create a level of\ntransparency, visibility and consistency to inform supplier discussions\nand deploy strategies to manage cash better during times\nof disruption.\n\n###### Cross supply chain collaboration\n\n**Supply chain 360:** With real-time insights and aggregated supply\nchain data in a single business intelligence dashboard, manufacturers\nare empowered with greater levels of visibility, transparency\nand insights for more informed decision-making. This dashboard\ncan be used to identify risks and take corrective steps,\nassess suppliers, control costs and more.\n\n\n**Demand analytics:** By collecting and analyzing millions ‚Äì\nif not billions ‚Äì of data points about market and customer\nbehavior and product performance, manufacturers can\nuse this understanding to improve operations and support\nstrategic decisions that affect the demand of products\nand services. [Around 80% say that using this form of data](https://paperzz.com/doc/8615467/the-demand-analytics-premium---strategy)\n[analysis has improved decision-making, while 26% say](https://paperzz.com/doc/8615467/the-demand-analytics-premium---strategy)\n[having this level of know-how to predict, shape and meet](https://paperzz.com/doc/8615467/the-demand-analytics-premium---strategy)\n[demands has increased their profits.](https://paperzz.com/doc/8615467/the-demand-analytics-premium---strategy)\n\n**Inventory visibility and tracking:**\nInventory visibility is the ability to view and track\ninventory in real time, with insights into SKU stock levels\nand which warehouse or fulfillment center it is stored at.\nWith complete oversight of inventory across multiple\nchannels, this helps improve supply chain efficiency,\ndemand forecasting and order accuracy, while ultimately\nenhancing the customer experience.\n\n\n**Inventory optimization:** The practice of having the right\namount of available inventory to meet demand, both in the\npresent and the future, enables manufacturers to address\ndemand expectations, and reduce the costs of common\ninventory issues. Inventory optimization incorporates\ndata for demand forecasting, inventory strategy and\nstock replenishment. With the addition of AI reinforced\nlearning models, this can help improve demand prediction,\nrecommend stock levels, and automatically order\nraw materials to fulfill orders, while also detecting\nand responding to shifts in demand.\n\n**Logistics route optimization:** Using AI, route optimization\ncan help manufacturers go beyond normal route planning\nand include parameters to further drive logistics efficiency.\nWhat-if scenarios present route options that help cut\ntransportation costs, boost productivity and execute\non-time deliveries.\n\n\n**Supply chain network design:** By building and modeling the supply\nchain, it enables manufacturers to understand the costs and time\nto bring goods and services to market. Supply chain network design\nhelps to evaluate delivery at the lowest possible cost, optimal sources\nand inventory deployment, as well as define distribution strategies.\n\n11 Four Forces Driving Intelligent Manufacturing\n\n\n-----\n\n[Successfully implementing AI-enabled supply](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/metals-and-mining/our-insights/succeeding-in-the-ai-supply-chain-revolution)\n[chain management has enabled early adopters to](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/metals-and-mining/our-insights/succeeding-in-the-ai-supply-chain-revolution)\n##### improve logistics costs by 15%, inventory levels by 35%, and service levels by 65%\n\n Only 6% of companies believe\n[they‚Äôve achieved full supply chain visibility](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/supply-chain-visibility-failure-survey-geodis/517751/\r)\n\n##### 57% believe that supply chain management \n[gives them a competitive edge that enables them](https://financesonline.com/supply-chain-statistics/\r)\n[to further develop their business](https://financesonline.com/supply-chain-statistics/\r)\n\n### Supply chain optimization case study\n\n##### Watch our case study\n\n12 Four Forces Driving Intelligent Manufacturing\n\n\n-----\n\n### Driving Force No. 3\n\n## Future opportunities for manufacturing business models\n\n##### When looking at the rapid evolution and growth of e-commerce, manufacturers have some catching up to do. Particularly when it comes to embracing new and customer-centric business models. For example, when shifting from a product to a service mindset, the product lifecycle becomes more holistic and the client relationship is maintained beyond the point of purchase.\n\n\nThese new opportunities are forming part\nof a longer-term industry shift from the sale\nof goods (CapEx) to recurring revenue streams,\nsuch as through Equipment-as-a-Service (EaaS)\nmodels. While this approach is not new to many\n(Rolls-Royce‚Äôs ‚ÄúPower-by-the-Hour‚Äù engine\nsubscription model has been around since 1962),\ncustomer demand, advances in industrial IoT\ntechnology, and a continuing decline in\nsales and margins have seen EaaS emerge\nas an imperative for manufacturers.\n\n\nOpening up some of these new revenue streams,\nof course, demands operational flexibility, but more\nimportantly, digital maturity. This means cloud\ntechnologies that allow employees new levels\nof access to data, the ability to work anywhere,\nand adapt rapidly to new needs. The introduction\nof a microservices architecture, to allow the agile\ndevelopment and deployment of new IT services.\nAnd the democratization of data, so the entire\norganization and its ecosystem of partners\nand suppliers have access to information\nabout market demand, operations, production,\nlogistics and transportation.\n\n\n13 Four Forces Driving Intelligent Manufacturing\n\n\n-----\n\n##### By 2023, 20% of industrial equipment manufacturers will\n[support EaaS with remote](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-07-28-gartner-identifies-top5-manufacturing-trends-2021)\n[Industrial IoT capabilities](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-07-28-gartner-identifies-top5-manufacturing-trends-2021)\n\n##### In 2025, the global EaaS market is estimated\n[to grow to $131B compared](https://iot-analytics.com/entering-the-decade-of-equipment-as-a-service/)\n[to $22B in 2019](https://iot-analytics.com/entering-the-decade-of-equipment-as-a-service/)\n\n##### In the U.S., 34% said\n[pay-per-use models represent](https://relayr.io/pr-forsa-survey/)\n[a big or a very big competitive](https://relayr.io/pr-forsa-survey/)\n[advantage, while 29% consider](https://relayr.io/pr-forsa-survey/)\n[it a slight advantage](https://relayr.io/pr-forsa-survey/)\n\n### Equipment as a service case study\n\n##### Read our case study\n\n\n### This level of visibility and collaboration is not only beneficial to lower maintenance costs, capital expenditure and human capital management, but also in empowering all stakeholders to make smarter and more informed decisions.\n\n\n###### Connected assets\n\nThe digital connectivity of high-value\nphysical assets is helping to drive a\nmore efficient use of assets and cost\nsavings. Connected assets can provide\ncontinuous, real-time data on their\noperating conditions, even if they are on\nthe other side of the world. Connected\nassets can also be used as the foundation\nof as-a-service business models to\ntrack the usage of rented machines, and\nfor automakers to use with connected\nvehicles and electrification strategies.\n\n\n###### Quality event detection and traceability\n\nManufacturers are increasingly seeking\nend-to-end supply chain traceability ‚Äî\nto be able to identify and trace\nthe history, distribution, location\nand application of products, parts\nand materials. With event-based\ntraceability, typically using blockchain\nledgers, manufacturers can record\nevents along the supply chain.\nThis can help aid legal compliance,\nsupport quality assurance and brand\ntrust, and provide full supply chain\nvisibility for better risk management.\n\n\n###### Demand-driven manufacturing\n\n**Equipment-as-a-Service:**\nStartup organizations without\nthe in-house infrastructure can\nuse a third-party to realize their\nconcepts, while manufacturers\nwith the production capabilities\ncan ensure minimal downtime\nfor their assets. This involves\ngreater risk for the manufacturer,\nbut also the potential for higher\nand annuitized revenues.\n\n\n14 Four Forces Driving Intelligent Manufacturing\n\n\n-----\n\n### Driving Force No. 4\n\n## The focus on sustainability\n\n##### It‚Äôs an inescapable truth that Earth‚Äôs resources are finite, and we need to change our present, linear business models for something that minimizes our use of resources and eliminates waste. Manufacturers need to take a more sustainable approach, where they can limit their negative environmental impacts, while also conserving energy and natural resources.\n\n\nWhen looking at the entire manufacturing\nvalue chain, there are many areas where\nmore sustainable practices can deliver\nmeasurable change. Products can be\ndesigned in a way that reduces waste\nand increases their longevity; materials\ncan be selected and sourced in a more\nethical way; operational efficiency and\ngreen energy can improve production;\nand the introduction of sustainable\npractices for transportation and\nshipping can help reduce carbon\nfootprints.

This infrastructure\n\nis traditionally built with on-premises data warehouses and data marts that are highly\n\ncomplex to maintain, costly to scale as compute is coupled with storage, limited from a\n\ndata science perspective, and they lack support for the growing volumes of unstructured\n\ndata. This inhibits data-driven innovation and blocks the use of AI, leaving agencies to\n\nsearch for data science tools to fill the gaps.\n\nInfrastructure also becomes harder and more expensive to maintain as it ages. Over time,\n\nthese environments become more complex due to their need for specialized patches and\n\nupdates that keep these systems available while doing nothing to solve the issues of poor\n\ninteroperability, ever-decreasing processing speeds, and an inability to scale ‚Äì all of which\n\nare critically necessary to support today‚Äôs more data-intensive use cases. For example,\n\nsystems at the departments of Education, Health and Human Services, Treasury, and Social\n\nSecurity are over 40 years old.¬π This is causing pain in a variety of areas.\n\n\noften requires significant customization and, even then, there is still a chance that the final\n\nintegration won‚Äôt be successful. These systems also keep personnel from spending their\n\nenergy and resources on emerging technologies such as AI.\n\nAnd data reliability is a big concern. Replication of data occurs across data marts as\n\nvarious teams try to access and explore it, creating data management and governance\n\nchallenges. Without a single source of truth, teams struggle with data inconsistencies,\n\nwhich can result in inaccurate analysis and model performance that is only compounded\n\nover time.\n\nThankfully, there are initiatives in place, such as the Data Center and Cloud Optimization\n\nInitiative Program Management Office (DCCOI PMO), which are investing in modernizing IT\n\ninfrastructure for federal agencies.¬≤\n\n\nMaintaining these systems requires a massive investment of both time and money\n\ncompared to modern cloud-based systems.

With different groups of data teams leveraging their own coding\n\nand analytical tools, communicating insights and working across teams ‚Äî let alone\n\nacross agencies ‚Äî is almost impossible. This lack of collaboration can drastically limit\n\nthe capabilities of any data analytics or AI initiatives ‚Äî from the deployment of shared\n\nbusiness intelligence (BI) reports and dashboards for data investigation and decision-\n\nmaking to the training of machine learning models to automate processes and make\n\npredictions.

As\nfinancial services institutions (FSIs) continue to accelerate their digital\ntransformation, cybercriminals, fraudsters and state-sponsored actors\ncontinue with more sophisticated threats. The impact of these attacks\nranges from the exposure of highly sensitive data to the disruption\nof services and the exploitation of backdoors for future attacks ‚Äî all\nresulting in both financial and non-financial costs. Responding quickly\nto potential threats requires security tools capable of analyzing billions\nof threat signals in real-time.\n\nRecently, it seems like every week reveals a new data breach or ransomware assault,\nand the cost is skyrocketing: more than $4 million per incident, up 10 percent from\n2020, and about $401 million for a substantial [breach at a large corporation](https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach) .\n\n\n**Cybersecurity is no longer just a back-office cost and now**\n**poses critical business risks, such as:**\n\n**‚Ä¢** Operational disruption\n\n**‚Ä¢** Material customer loss\n\n**‚Ä¢** Increase in insurance premiums\n\n**‚Ä¢** Lawsuits or fines\n\n**‚Ä¢** Systemic destabilization\n\n**‚Ä¢** Credit downgrade\n\n**‚Ä¢** Reputational damage\n\nSource: Navigating Cyber 2022, FS-ISAC, Annual Cyber Threat Review and Predictions\n\n\n-----\n\n## A New Commitment to Cybersecurity\n\n\nIt comes as no surprise that in recent years FSIs have seen an amplified\ncommitment to cybersecurity. As business leaders look to new solutions, large\nportions of IT budgets are now devoted to leveraging data and AI to thwart\ncyberattacks.\n\nFurthermore, regulators are taking notice of the increased risk of cybersecurity\nthreats. Growing geopolitical tensions have also prompted federal agencies such\nas the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Federal Bureau\nof Investigation [to warn](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/russia-ukraine-latest-news-2022-04-05/card/banks-haven-t-seen-rise-in-cyberattacks-from-russia-yet-p3F5ebzAhTauVjsNx46E) that ‚Äútough sanctions imposed on Russia could prompt a\nspate of cyberattacks against critical infrastructure such as banks.‚Äù Additionally,\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission released its [2022 Exam Priorities](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-57) , which\ninclude information security, and specifically ‚Äúhow firms are safeguarding their\ncustomers‚Äô records and assets from cyber threats, including oversight of thirdparty providers, identification of red flags related to identity theft, response to\nincidents, including to ransomware attacks and management of operational risk in\nlight of ‚Äòa dispersed workforce.‚Äô‚Äù\n\nHowever, as is often the case, implementing new cybersecurity strategies and\nprocesses is easier said than done.\n\n\n**Cybersecurity needs a transformation**\n**... breaches, cost and complexity are growing**\n\n\n## 100%\nof organizations surveyed have had\nbreaches.\n**The average breach costs $4M**\n\n## 85%\n**will increase their cyber budget**\nnext FY.

However, these legacy technologies were built for a world where big\ndata was measured in gigabytes, not today‚Äôs terabytes or petabytes. This means\nthat not only are legacy SIEMs unable to scale to today‚Äôs data volumes, but they\nare also unable to serve the modern, distributed enterprise.\n\nBy now, the advantages of moving to the cloud are no secret to anyone. For FSIs,\nscalability, simplicity, efficiency and cost are absolutely essential components of\nsuccess. Many within FinServ are looking to cloud computing to make this possible,\nadding detection and response in the cloud to the security team‚Äôs responsibility.\n\nBecause legacy SIEMs predate the emergence of cloud, artificial intelligence and\nmachine learning (AI/ML) in the mainstream, they‚Äôre unable to address the complex\ndata and AI-driven analytics needed for threat detection, threat hunting, in-stream\nthreat intelligence enrichment, analytical automation and analyst collaboration.\n\nIn other words, legacy SIEMs are no longer suitable for the modern enterprise or\nthe current threat landscape.\n\n\n**Counting the Financial Cost of Legacy SIEMs**\n\nThe financial cost of the continued use of legacy SIEMs continues to rise because\nmost SIEM providers charge their customers based on the volume of data\ningested. While some legacy technologies are available in the cloud, they‚Äôre either\nnot designed to be cloud-native applications or confined to a single cloud service\nprovider. As a result, security teams have to employ multiple tools for detection,\ninvestigation and response ‚Äî or pay exorbitant egress charges for data transiting\nfrom one cloud provider to another. This causes operational slowdowns, errors\ndriven by complexity, and inconsistent implementation of security policies.\n\nA lack of support for multiple clouds also means an increase in maintenance\noverhead. Security staff members are often stressed because analysts have to\nlearn different tools for different cloud platforms. For some, it also creates an\nimplicit cloud vendor lock-in, meaning that security teams are unable to support\nmissions because their tools are not portable across multiple cloud providers.\n\nCollectively, these drawbacks to legacy SIEMs result in a much weaker security\nposture for FSIs.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Journey of SecOps: Destination Lakehouse\n\nHow did security analytics get to this point? In the early days, there was a need to aggregate alerts from antiviruses and intrusion detection systems. SIEMs were born, built\non data warehouses, relational databases or NoSQL database management systems. But as incident investigation needs evolved, those data warehouses weren‚Äôt able to\nhandle the volume and variety of data, which led to the development of data lakes. Data lakes were cost-effective and scalable but didn‚Äôt have strong data governance and\ndata hygiene, earning them the moniker of ‚Äúdata swamps.‚Äù Simply integrating the two tech stacks is really complicated because of varying governance models, data silos\nand inconsistent use case support. Fast-forward to today, security teams now need AI/ML at scale in a multicloud world.\n\nWhy choose one or the other? The lakehouse architecture has emerged in recent years to help address these concerns with a single unified architecture for all your threat\ndata, analytics and AI in the cloud. The governance and transactional capabilities of the data warehouse, the scale and flexibility of a data lake, AI/ML from the ground up\nand multicloud native deployments in one platform ‚Äì this is a modern architecture called the lakehouse (data lake and data warehouse).\n\n**Current Challenges** **Introducing the Data Lakehouse**\n\n\n**Cloud Storage**\nNo support for\nanalytics or\ninvestigations\n\n**SIEMs**\nNo attack chaining.\nPoor for high\ncardinality search.\n\n\n**UBA tools**\nNo historical search,\nblackbox,\nproprietary storage\n\n**No SIEM/Log**\nsolution is\nmulticloud\nnative\n\n\n**Curated Alerts** **Cloud-scale**\n**search**\n\n**ML/AI** **Multicloud**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Rethinking Cybersecurity in Financial Services With Databricks Lakehouse\n\nDatabricks introduced the first data lakehouse platform to the industry, and today over 7,000 customers use it worldwide. With Databricks Lakehouse, FSIs that are ready to\nmodernize their data infrastructure and analytics capabilities for better protection against cyber threats now have one cost-effective solution that addresses the needs of\nall their teams.\n\nThe Databricks Lakehouse Platform combines the best elements of data lakes and data warehouses, delivering the low-cost, flexible object stores offered by data lakes and\nthe data management and performance typically found in data warehouses. This unified platform simplifies existing architecture by eliminating the data silos that traditionally\nseparate analytics, data science and ML. It‚Äôs built on open source, open data and open standards to maximize flexibility, and its inherent collaborative capabilities accelerate\nthe ability to work across teams and innovate faster. Moreover, because it‚Äôs multicloud, it works the same way no matter which cloud provider is used.\n\nETL and Enrichment\n\n**Proof Point**\n\n**Firewall**\n\n**Antivirus**\n\n\n-----\n\n## Lakehouse in Financial Services\n\nBy unifying data with analytics and AI, Lakehouse allows FSIs to easily access all their data for downstream advanced analytics capabilities to support complex security\nuse cases. Lakehouse facilitates collaboration between threat intelligence teams and cyber operations, enables security operations teams to detect advanced threats, and\nreduces human resource burnout through analytical automation and collaboration. Importantly, Lakehouse also accelerates investigations from days to minutes.\n\nAlong with a more modern architecture, the Lakehouse Platform includes Delta Lake, which unifies all security data in a transactional data lake to feed advanced analytics.\nThe analytics and collaboration are done in notebooks, and security teams can use multiple languages ‚Äî SQL, Python, R and Scala ‚Äî in the same notebook. This makes\nit easy for security practitioners to explore data and develop advanced analytics and reporting using their favorite methods. Additionally, a separation of compute from\nstorage means performance at scale without impacting overall storage costs.\n\n\n-----\n\n**C A S E S T U D Y**\n\n**When It Comes to Security, Data Is the Best Defense***\n\n**Protecting HSBC‚Äôs 40 million customers begins with collecting and processing data from billions**\n**of signals to make previously impossible threat detection possible**\n\nsecurity operation departments, creating an enhanced relationship that results\nin better defenses, insight into the security posture of the organization, and the\nability to respond at the pace of the adversary.\n\n\nThe old way of thinking about security ‚Äî stronger locks, higher walls ‚Äî is outdated\nand ineffective. ‚ÄúWhen defending an organization, too often we just focus heavily\non tools, technology, and reactive scenarios,‚Äù said T.J. Campana, managing director\nof global defense and chief technology officer at HSBC, the multinational bank. ‚ÄúBut\nthe security business is a data business. And the data always has a story to tell us.‚Äù\n\nThe quality of security, he added, is proportional to the information that can be\n\ndistilled from petabytes of data that endlessly flows through company networks.\nThat means ‚Äúempowering people to get the right insights, in the right way to\nquickly prevent, detect, and respond to threats, wherever and whenever they\noccur,‚Äù said George Webster, executive director of global cybersecurity science\nand analytics at HSBC.\n\nIf a big organization is made up of tens of millions of parts that must click together\nseamlessly, security keeps those seals tight. Data gathering, analytical tools, and\nhuman intellect work together as one. This involves fusing the data science and\n\n\nBut working across years of data at petabyte scale is not an easy task, especially\nwhen a long time is measured in minutes and the adversary is constantly working\nagainst you. To put this in perspective, the security teams at HSBC intake 10 times\nthe amount of data contained in all of the books in the U.S. Library of Congress\nevery day, and must process months, if not years, of data at a time. That is where\ninnovative design, smart people, and leveraging the right technology come into\nplay. ‚ÄúWe have to break the paradigm of the tool being the end goal of defense\nand instead view the tools as an enabler of our people,‚Äù said Webster. ‚ÄúIt is always\nabout the people,‚Äù added Campana.\n\nHSBC turned away from the common security paradigm by leveraging the big data\nprocessing techniques from Azure Databricks. In many ways, their open source\nDelta Lake is the key enabler, with Spark being the engine. Delta Lake allows these\nteams to structure, optimize, and unlock data at scale, while Spark allows multiple\ncomplex programs to seamlessly crunch through the data. This enables HSBC‚Äôs\nsecurity teams to constantly evolve their defenses, create new capabilities at\npace, and perform investigations that were previously impossible. When a new\nthreat emerges, the bank doesn‚Äôt have the luxury to wait for the security market to\nidentify, respond, and mitigate. Instead, the bank turns to its people and creates\nwhat is needed at breathtaking speed.\n\n\n-----\n\n**C A S E S T U D Y : C O N T I N U E D**\n\n\nIt‚Äôs an essential function for HSBC, which needs to continually think about how to\nkeep more than 40 million customers in 64 countries and territories safe. Taken\ntogether, it‚Äôs an all-brains-on-deck moment with data and people guiding the\nship. It‚Äôs also a tall task for a company as massive and multifaceted as HSBC.\nHeadquartered in the UK, it is one of the largest global banks (total assets: a\nwhopping $2.968 trillion), with operations across Africa, Europe, Asia, and the\nAmericas. It‚Äôs also the largest bank in Hong Kong and even prints some of the local\ncurrency, which bears the HSBC name.\n\nThe bank‚Äôs cybersecurity approach involves fusing the data science and security\noperation departments, creating an enhanced relationship that results in more\nefficient threat discovery, rapid development of operational use cases and AI\nmodels. This enables the continuous creation of capabilities that stop adversaries\nbefore they even start. ‚ÄúWe have to get out of the mindset that security is a walled\ngarden,‚Äù said Webster. ‚ÄúWe must create truly collaborative environments for our\npeople to enable the business to operate,‚Äù said Campana.\n\nStaffing this symbiotic power center will be someone Campana optimistically calls\n‚Äúthe analyst of the future,‚Äù a description that‚Äôs both mindset and skillset: threat\nhunter and data scientist.\n\nIn addition, when another organization is hit by cybercrime, HSBC analyzes it\nto understand how it may have responded and then improves its defenses\naccordingly. That‚Äôs in contrast to the industry norm; a Ponemon survey revealed\n\n\nthat 47 percent of organizations have not assessed the readiness of their incident\nresponse teams. That means the first time they test their plans will be at the worst\npossible time ‚Äî in the middle of a cyber attack.\n\nThe proactive approach is a far cry from the old reactive conveyor belt model of\nsecurity when alert tickets were received from tooling and processed in a slow\nand linear way. Today, cross-disciplinary security teams don‚Äôt just react; they\ncontinually search for the signals in the noise ‚Äî tiny aberrations that indicate\nsomething‚Äôs not right ‚Äì and send up red flags in real-time. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre scanning\nhundreds of billions of signals per day. I cannot wait. We need situational\nawareness right now,‚Äù said Campana.\n\nThat increased speed is critical for threat assessment. Information theft may be\nthe most expensive and fastest-rising consequence of cybercrime, but data is not\nthe only target. Core systems are being hacked in a dangerous trend to disrupt\nand destroy. Regulators are also increasingly asking banks for controls in place to\ndetect and preempt financial crimes. That‚Äôs where big data tooling like Delta Lake\nand Spark shine, and where it will continually be called on to address the security\nneeds of new initiatives.\n\n‚ÄúDigital security is about organically adjusting to risks,‚Äù said Webster. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a journey\nof continual discovery with one central goal: to protect customers. They want\nthings easy and they want them quick. It‚Äôs our job to make sure that it‚Äôs secure.‚Äù\n\n*This story previously appeared in [WIRED Brand Lab for Databricks](https://www.wired.com/sponsored/story/when-it-comes-to-security-data-is-the-best-defense/) .\n\n\n-----\n\n**Advantages of a Lakehouse**\n\n\n**A cost-efficient upgrade**\n\nDatabricks customers only pay for the data they\nanalyze, not for what they collect. This means that\nsecurity teams can collect any amount of data\nwithout worrying about ingest-based pricing, and\nonly pay for the data that‚Äôs actually used for analysis\n‚Äî for example, an incident investigation or a data\ncall for an audit. This pricing model enables security\nteams to collect data that was previously out of\nreach, such as netflow data, endpoint detection and\nresponse data, and application and services data.\n\nFurther, Databricks is a fully managed service,\nmeaning that security teams don‚Äôt have to\npre-commit to hardware capital expenditures.\nWith no hardware to manage and no big data\nimplementations to maintain, security teams\ncan significantly reduce their management and\nmaintenance costs.\n\n\n**Multicloud**\n\nDatabricks is cloud-native on AWS, Microsoft Azure\nand Google Cloud. This creates freedom for the\nsecurity teams to use whatever cloud provider they\nlike. Additionally, teams can acquire and maintain\noperational consistency across all providers when\nthey have multiple cloud footprints. This enables\nconsistent policy implementation, reduced\ncomplexity for staff and increased efficiency.\n\nAdditionally, Databricks enables faster detection,\ninvestigation and response across the enterprise\nbecause analytics can be reused across the\nmajor cloud providers through a unified platform\nthat centralizes data for easy sharing and fosters\ncollaboration across teams.\n\n\n**Enterprise security and**\n**360¬∞ risk management**\n\nThe Lakehouse Platform is easy to set up, manage,\nscale and, most importantly, secure. This is because\nLakehouse easily integrates with existing security\nand management tools, enabling users to extend\ntheir policies for peace of mind and greater control.\n\nWith multicloud management, security admins and\ndata teams get a consistent experience across all\nmajor cloud providers. This saves valuable time\nand the resources required to upskill talent on\nproprietary services for data, analytics and AI.\n\nSecurity, risk and compliance leaders are also\nable to give team members a range of security\npermissions that come with thorough audit trails.\nThis allows teams to quickly spin up and wind down\ncollaborative workspaces for any project and to\nmanage use cases from end to end ‚Äî from enabling\nuser access and controlling spend to auditing usage\nand analyzing activity across every workspace to\nenforce user and data governance.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Lakehouse and SIEM: The Pattern  for Cloud-Scale Security Operations\n\n\nAccording to George Webster, head of cybersecurity sciences and analytics at\nHSBC, Lakehouse and SIEM is the pattern for security operations. What does\nit look like? It leverages the strengths of the two components: Lakehouse for\nmulticloud native storage and analytics, SIEM for security operations workflows.\nFor Databricks customers like HSBC, there are two general patterns for this\nintegration that are both underpinned by what Webster calls the cybersecurity\ndata lake with Lakehouse.\n\nIn the first pattern, Lakehouse stores all the data for the maximum retention\nperiod. A subset of the data is then sent to the SIEM and stored for a fraction of\nthe time. This pattern has the advantage of allowing analysts to query near-term\n\n\ndata using the SIEM while having the ability to do historical analysis and more\nsophisticated analytics in Databricks. It also lets them manage any licensing or\nstorage costs for the SIEM deployment.\n\nThe second pattern is to send the highest-volume data sources to Databricks ‚Äî\nfor example, cloud-native logs, endpoint threat detection and response logs, DNS\ndata and network events. Low-volume data sources such as alerts, e-mail logs\nand vulnerability scan data go to the SIEM. This pattern enables Tier 1 analysts to\nquickly handle high-priority alerts in the SIEM. Threat-hunt teams and investigators\ncan leverage the advanced analytical capabilities of Databricks. This pattern has a\ncost-benefit of offloading processing, ingestion and storage from the SIEM.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Databricks and Splunk:**\n**A Case Study in Cost-Savings**\n\nDatabricks integrates with your preferred SIEM, like\nSplunk, and the Splunk-certified Databricks add-on\ncan be used to meet SOC needs without changing\nthe user interface. This example features a global\nfinancial institution‚Äôs security operation, where\nthe organization grew throughput from 25TB per\nday with only 180 days lookback, to 100TB per day\nwith 395 days lookback using the Databricks SIEM\naugmentation. The total cost of ownership savings,\nincluding infrastructure and license costs, saved tens\nof millions (more than $80mn per year) in cloud costs.\n\n\n##### FinServ Security Operations\n\nDatabricks + Splunk **Drastically** Lowered Costs\n\n**CURRENT STATE** **FUTURE OPTION**\n\n100\n\n75\n\n\n**Throughput**\nTB per day\n\n**Lookback**\n**period**\nDays\n\n\n50\n\n\n**100**\n\n\n25\n\n**25**\n\n0\n\nSplunk only Splunk + Databricks\n\n**395**\n\n**180**\n\nSplunk only Splunk + Databricks\n\nTCO savings with Splunk and Databricks vs. Splunk only solution: $81M\n\n\n-----\n\n## Common Use Cases\n\nAs FSIs focus on modernizing their data analytics and warehousing capabilities, the Databricks Lakehouse Platform\nbrings a new level of empowerment to FSIs, allowing them to unlock the full potential of their data to deliver on their\nobjectives and better serve their customers.\n\n**Common use cases include:**\n\n\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Threat hunting:** Empower security teams to\nproactively detect and discover advanced\nthreats using months or years of data\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Incident investigation:** Gain complete visibility\nacross network, endpoint, cloud and application\ndata to respond to incidents\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Phishing threat detection:** Uncover social\nengineering attacks that are often used to steal\nuser data, including log-in credentials and credit\ncard numbers\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Supply chain monitoring:** Leverage ML to\nidentify suspicious behavior within your software\nsupply chain\n\n\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Ransomware detection:** Scope the impact\nand spread of ransomware attacks to inform\ncomplete mitigation and remediation\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Credentials-abuse detection:** Identify and\ninvestigate anomalous credential usage across\nyour infrastructure\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Insider-threats detection:** Find and respond\nto malicious threats from people within an\norganization who have inside information about\nsecurity practices, data and computer systems\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Network traffic analysis:** Examine real-time\nnetwork availability and activity to identify\nanomalies, vulnerabilities and malware\n\n\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Analytics automation:** Automatically\ncontextualize and enrich multiple streaming and\nbatch analytics to accelerate analyst workflows\nand decision-making\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Augmenting anti-money laundering practices**\n**(AML):** Using structured and unstructured\ndata to maintain a list of politically exposed\nindividuals, often referred to as PEP, to augment a\nbank‚Äôs AML processes.

Unfortunately, this led to the lock-in, high costs and complex\ngovernance inherent in proprietary architectures.\n\nOur customers have asked us to simplify their data architecture. We decided to accelerate\nour investments to do just that.\n\n\nWe introduced [Databricks SQL](https://databricks.com/product/databricks-sql) to simplify and provide data warehousing capabilities and\nfirst-class support for SQL on the [Databricks Lakehouse Platform](https://databricks.com/product/data-lakehouse) , for all your existing tools.\nWe use the term ‚Äúlakehouse‚Äù to reflect our customers‚Äô desire to combine the best of data\nwarehouses and data lakes. With the lakehouse, you can now establish one source of truth\nfor all data and enable all workloads from AI to BI on one platform. And we want to provide\nyou with ease-of-use and state-of-the-art performance at the lowest cost.\n\n\n**Reynold Xin**\n\nOriginal Creator of Apache Spark, TM\nCo-founder and Chief Architect,\nDatabricks\n\n\nThis eBook covers how we went back to the drawing board to build Databricks SQL ‚Äî the\nlast mile of enabling data warehousing capabilities for your existing data lakes ‚Äî as part of\nthe Databricks Lakehouse Platform.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Introduction\n\n\nMost organizations operate their business with a complex data architecture that\ncombines data warehouses and data lakes. For one thing, data lakes are great\nfor machine learning (ML). They support open formats and a large ecosystem.\nBut data lakes have poor support for business intelligence (BI) and suffer\ncomplex data quality problems. Data warehouses, on the other hand, are great\nfor BI applications. But they have limited support for ML workloads, can‚Äôt handle\nnatural language data, large-scale structured data, or raw, video, audio or image\nfiles, and are proprietary systems with only a SQL interface.\n\nAs a result, data is moved around the organization through data pipelines and\nsystems that create a multitude of data silos. A large amount of time is spent\nmaintaining these pipelines and systems rather than creating new value from\ndata, and downstream consumers struggle to get a single source of truth of the\ndata due to the inherent siloing of data that takes place. The situation becomes\nvery expensive, and decision-making speed and quality are negatively affected.\n\nUnifying these systems can be transformational in how we think about data.\n\n\n##### The need for simplification\n\nIt is time for a new data architecture that can meet both today‚Äôs and tomorrow‚Äôs\nneeds. Without any compromise. Advanced analytics and ML are one of the\nmost strategic priorities for data-driven organizations today, and the amount\nof unstructured data is growing exponentially. So it makes sense to position\nthe data lake as the center of the data infrastructure. However, for this to be\nachievable, the data lake needs to adopt the strengths of data warehouses.\n\nThe answer is the [lakehouse](https://databricks.com/blog/2021/05/19/evolution-to-the-data-lakehouse.html) , an open data architecture enabled by a new open\nand standardized system design: one that implements data structure and data\nmanagement features similar to those in a data warehouse, directly on the lowcost storage used for data lakes.\n\n**[DOWNLOAD NOW](https://databricks.com/p/ebook/building-the-data-lakehouse?utm_medium=paid+search&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=14925739153&utm_adgroup=133613202892&utm_content=ebook&utm_offer=building-the-data-lakehouse&utm_ad=552195081555&utm_term=data%20lakehouse%20databricks&gclid=Cj0KCQiAzMGNBhCyARIsANpUkzPYW8MmlNjO9tOWa_35rFFe7Jti32z5Debcr_nG5QU_1-GEuznzUy8aAm-PEALw_wcB)**\n\n##### Building the Data Lakehouse\n[Bill Immon, Father of the Data Warehouse](https://databricks.com/p/ebook/building-the-data-lakehouse?utm_medium=paid+search&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=14925739153&utm_adgroup=133613202892&utm_content=ebook&utm_offer=building-the-data-lakehouse&utm_ad=552195081555&utm_term=data%20lakehouse%20databricks&gclid=Cj0KCQiAzMGNBhCyARIsANpUkzPYW8MmlNjO9tOWa_35rFFe7Jti32z5Debcr_nG5QU_1-GEuznzUy8aAm-PEALw_wcB)\n\n\n-----\n\n### Our Approach:  The Databricks Lakehouse Platform\n\nOur customers have asked us for simplification. This is why we‚Äôve embarked on\nthis journey to deliver one simple, open and collaborative platform for all your\ndata, AI and BI workloads on your existing data lakes.\n\nThe [Databricks Lakehouse Platform](https://databricks.com/product/data-lakehouse) greatly simplifies data architectures by\ncombining the data management and performance typically found in data\nwarehouses with the low-cost, flexible object stores offered by data lakes.\n\nIt‚Äôs built on open source and open standards to maximize flexibility, and lets you\nstore all your data ‚Äî structured, semi-structured and unstructured ‚Äî in your\nexisting data lake while still getting the data quality, performance, security and\ngovernance you‚Äôd expect from a data warehouse. Data only needs to exist once\nto support all of your data, AI and BI workloads on one common platform\n‚Äî establishing one source of truth.\n\nFinally, the Lakehouse Platform provides tailored and collaborative\nexperiences so data engineers, data scientists and analysts can work together\non one common platform across the entire data lifecycle ‚Äî from ingestion to\nconsumption and the serving of data products ‚Äî and innovate faster.\n\nLet‚Äôs look at how, with the right data structures and data management\ncapabilities in place, we can now deliver data warehouse and analytics\ncapabilities on your lakehouse. That‚Äôs where Databricks SQL (DB SQL) comes in.\n\n**[DISCOVER LAKEHOUSE](https://databricks.com/discoverlakehouse)**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Introducing Databricks SQL:  The Best Data Warehouse Is a Lakehouse\n\n\nDatabricks SQL is a serverless data warehouse on the Databricks Lakehouse\nPlatform that lets you run all your SQL and BI applications at scale with up to 12x\nbetter price/performance, a unified governance model, open formats and APIs,\nand your tools of choice ‚Äî no vendor lock-in.

Specifically, we‚Äôll dive into how we built Databricks SQL to deliver\nanalytics and data warehousing workloads on your lakehouse.\n\n\nThose layers are:\n\n**1 .** The storage layer, or how we store and govern data\n\n**2 .** The compute layer, or how we process queries\n\n**3 .** The consumption layer, or the tools you can use to interface with the system\n\n\n###### PART 1: STORAGE LAYER\n\nIn order to bring the best of data lakes and data\nwarehouses, we needed to support the openness\nand flexibility of data lakes, as well as the quality,\nperformance and governance you‚Äôd expect from a\ndata warehouse.\n\n\n**Storage layer attributes ‚Äî data lake vs. data warehouse vs. data lakehouse**\n\n|Data Lake Open format|Data Warehouse Closed, proprietary format|Data Lakehouse Open format|\n|---|---|---|\n|Low quality, ‚Äúdata swamp‚Äù|High-quality, reliable data|High-quality, reliable data|\n|File-level access control|Fine-grained governance (tables row/columnar level)|Fine-grained governance (tables row/columnar level)|\n|All data types|Structured only|All data types|\n|Requires manually specifying how to lay out data|Automatically lays out data to query efficiently|Automatically lays out data to query efficiently|\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Transactional guarantees for your data lake\n\n\nThe open source format [Delta Lake](https://delta.io/) ‚Äî based on Parquet ‚Äî solves historical data\nlake challenges around data quality and reliability. It is the foundation for the\nlakehouse, and Databricks SQL stores and processes data using Delta Lake.\n\nFor example, it provides ACID transactions to ensure that every operation either\nfully succeeds or fully aborts for later retries ‚Äî without requiring new data\npipelines to be created. It unifies batch and streaming pipelines so you can\neasily merge existing and new data at the speed required for your business. With\nTime Travel, Delta Lake automatically records all past transactions, so it‚Äôs easy\nto access and use previous versions of your data for compliance needs or for\nML applications. Advanced indexing, caching and auto-tuning allow optimization\nof Delta tables for the best query performance. Delta Lake also acts as the\nfoundation for fine-grained, role-based access controls on the lakehouse.\n\nAs a result, Delta Lake allows you to treat tables in Databricks SQL just like you\ntreat tables in a database: updates, inserts and merges can take place with high\nperformance at the row level. This is particularly useful if you are inserting new\n\n\ndata rapidly (e.g., in IoT or e-commerce use cases), or if you are redacting data\n(e.g., for compliance laws such as GDPR). Furthermore, Delta Lake provides you\nwith one open and standard format ‚Äî not only for SQL but also for Python, Scala\nand other languages ‚Äî so you can run all analytical and ML use cases on the\nsame data.\n\n**Delta Lake provides the key**\n\nAn open format storage layer built for lake-first architecture\n\nACID transactions, Time Travel, highly available\n\nAdvanced indexing, caching, auto-tuning\n\nFine-grained, role-based access controls\n\nStreaming & batch, analytics & ML\n\nPython, SQL, R, Scala\n\nDelta Lake brings data quality, performance and governance to the lakehouse\n\n**[DOWNLOAD NOW](https://databricks.com/p/ebook/delta-lake-the-definitive-guide-by-oreilly)**\n##### Delta Lake: The Definitive Guide\n[by O‚ÄôReilly](https://databricks.com/p/ebook/delta-lake-the-definitive-guide-by-oreilly)\n\n\n-----\n\n##### A framework for building a curated data lake\n\n\nWith the ability to ingest petabytes of data with auto-evolving schemas, Delta\nLake helps turn raw data into actionable data by incrementally and efficiently\nprocessing data as it arrives from files or streaming sources like Kafka, Kinesis,\nEvent Hubs, DBMS and NoSQL. It can also automatically and efficiently track data\nas it arrives with no manual intervention, as well as infer schema, detect column\nchanges for structured and unstructured data formats, and prevent data loss by\nrescuing data columns that don‚Äôt meet data quality specifications. And now with\n[Partner Connect](https://www.databricks.com/partnerconnect) , it‚Äôs never been easier to bring in critical business data from\nvarious sources.\n\nAs you refine the data, you can add more structure to it. Databricks recommends\nthe Bronze, Silver and Gold pattern. It lets you easily merge and transform new\nand existing data ‚Äî in batch or streaming ‚Äî while benefiting from the low-cost,\nflexible object storage offered by data lakes. Bronze is the initial landing zone\nfor the pipeline. We recommend copying data that‚Äôs as close to its raw form as\npossible to easily replay the whole pipeline from the beginning, if needed. Silver\nis where the raw data gets cleansed (think data quality checks), transformed\nand potentially enriched with external data sets. Gold is the production-grade\ndata that your entire company can rely on for business intelligence, descriptive\nstatistics, and data science/machine learning.\n\n\nBy the time you get to Gold, the tables are high-value business-level metrics\nthat have all the schema enforcement and constraints applied. This way, you can\nretain the flexibility of the data lake at the Bronze and Silver levels, and then use\nthe Gold level for high-quality business data.\n\nAuto Loader\n\n\nBRONZE\n\n\nSILVER GOLD\n\n\nStructured Streaming\n\nBatch\n\nCOPY INTO\n\nPartners\n\n\nRaw ingestion Filtered, cleaned Business-level\nand history and augmented aggregates\n\n|Col1|Col2|\n|---|---|\n||R|\n\n\n**[LEARN MORE](https://youtu.be/n9cRw6AkNDQ)**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### An aside on batch and streaming data pipelines\n\n\nThe best way to set up and run data pipelines in the Bronze/Silver/Gold\npattern recommended on the previous page is in Delta Live Tables (DLT).\nDLT makes it easy to build and manage reliable batch and streaming\ndata pipelines that deliver high-quality data. It helps data engineering\nteams simplify ETL development and management with declarative\npipeline development, automatic data testing, and deep visibility for\nmonitoring and recovery.\n\nThe fact that you can run all your batch and streaming pipelines together\nin one simple, declarative framework makes data engineering easy on the\nDatabricks Lakehouse Platform. We regularly talk to customers who have\nbeen able to reduce pipeline development time from weeks ‚Äî or months\n‚Äî to mere minutes with Delta Live Tables. And by the way, even data\n\n\nanalysts can easily interrogate DLT pipelines for the queries they need\nto run, without knowing any sort of specialized programming language\nor niche skills.\n\nOne of the top benefits of DLT, and Delta Lake in general, is that it is built\nwith streaming pipelines in mind. Today, the world operates in real time, and\nbusinesses are increasingly expected to analyze and respond to their data in\nreal time. With streaming data pipelines built on DLT, analysts can easily access,\nquery and analyze data with greater accuracy and actionability than with\nconventional batch processing. Delta Live Tables makes real-time analytics a\nreality for our customers.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Fine-grained governance on the lakehouse\n\nDelta Lake is the foundation for open and secure [data sharing](https://databricks.com/blog/2021/05/26/introducing-delta-sharing-an-open-protocol-for-secure-data-sharing.html) and governance\non the lakehouse. It underpins the [Databricks Unity Catalog](https://databricks.com/product/unity-catalog) (in preview), which\nprovides fine-grained governance across clouds, data and ML assets. Among the\nbenefits of the Unity Catalog, it allows you to:\n\n**‚Ä¢ Discover, audit and govern data assets in one place:** A user-friendly\ninterface, automated data lineage across tables, columns, notebooks,\nworkflows and dashboards, role-based security policies, table or\ncolumn-level tags, and central auditing capabilities make it easy for\ndata stewards to discover, manage and secure data access to meet\ncompliance and privacy needs directly on the lakehouse.\n\n\n\n**‚Ä¢ Grant and manage permissions using SQL:** Unity Catalog brings finegrained centralized governance to data assets across clouds through the\nopen standard SQL DCL. This means database administrators can easily\ngrant permission to arbitrary, user-specific views, or set permissions on\nall columns tagged together, using familiar SQL.\n\n**‚Ä¢ Centrally manage and audit shared data across organizations:** Every\norganization needs to share data with customers, partners and suppliers\nto better collaborate and to unlock value from their data. Unity Catalog\nbuilds on open source [Delta Sharing](http://delta.io/sharing) to centrally manage and govern\nshared assets within and across organizations.\n\n\nThe Unity Catalog makes it easy for data stewards to discover, manage and secure data access\nto meet compliance and privacy needs on the lakehouse.\n\n**[LEARN MORE](https://databricks.com/blog/2021/05/26/introducing-databricks-unity-catalog-fine-grained-governance-for-data-and-ai-on-the-lakehouse.html)**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### PART 2: COMPUTE LAYER\n\n\nThe next layer to look at is the compute layer, or how we process queries.\n\nApache Spark TM has been the de facto standard for data lake compute. It‚Äôs great\nfor processing terabytes and petabytes of data cheaply, but historically Spark\nSQL uses a nonstandard syntax and can be difficult to configure.\n\n\nData warehouses, on the other hand, tend to support short running queries\nreally well, especially when you have a lot of users issuing queries concurrently.\nThey tend to be easier to set up, but don‚Äôt necessarily scale or they become\ntoo costly.\n\n\n**Compute layer attributes ‚Äî data lake vs. data warehouse vs. data lakehouse**\n\n|Data Lake High performance for large jobs (TBs to PBs)|Data Warehouse High concurrency|Data Lakehouse High performance for large jobs (TBs to PBs)|\n|---|---|---|\n|Economical|Scaling is exponentially more expensive|Economical|\n|High operational complexity|Ease of use|Ease of use|\n||||\n\n\nA popular belief is that large workloads require a drastically different system\nthan low latency, high concurrency workloads. For example, there‚Äôs the classic\ntrade-off in computer systems between latency and throughput.\n\nBut after spending a lot of time analyzing these systems, we found that it was\npossible to simultaneously improve large query performance and concurrency\n\n\nand latency. Although the classic trade-offs definitely existed, they were only\nexplicit when we optimized the system to the very theoretical optimal. It turned\nout the vast majority of software ‚Äî and this includes all data warehouse systems\nand Databricks ‚Äî were far away from optimal.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Simplified administration and instant, elastic SQL compute ‚Äî decoupled from storage\n\n\nTo achieve world-class performance for analytics on the lakehouse, we chose to\ncompletely rebuild the compute layer. But performance isn‚Äôt everything. We also\nwant it to be simple to administer and cheaper to use. Databricks SQL leverages\nserverless SQL warehouses that let you get started in seconds, and it‚Äôs powered\nby a new native MPP vectorized engine: Photon.\n\nDatabricks SQL warehouses are optimized and elastic SQL compute resources.\nJust pick the cluster size and Databricks automatically determines the best\ninstance types and VMs configuration for the best price/performance. This\nmeans you don‚Äôt have to worry about estimating peak demand or paying too\nmuch by overprovisioning. You just need to click a few buttons to operate.\nTo further streamline the experience, simply use [Databrick SQL Serverless](https://databricks.com/blog/2021/08/30/announcing-databricks-serverless-sql.html) .\nWith the serverless capability, queries start rapidly with zero infrastructure\nmanagement or configuration overhead. This lowers your total cost, as you pay\nonly for what you consume without idle time or overprovisioned resources.\n\n\nSince CPU clock speeds have plateaued, we also wanted to find new ways to\nprocess data faster, beyond raw compute power. One of the most impactful\nmethods has been to improve the amount of data that can be processed in\nparallel. However, data processing engines need to be specifically architected to\ntake advantage of this parallelism. So, from the ground up, we built [Photon](https://databricks.com/product/photon) , a new\nC++ based vectorized query processing engine that dramatically improves query\nperformance while remaining fully compatible with open Spark APIs. Databricks\nSQL warehouses are powered by Photon, which seamlessly coordinates work and\nresources and transparently accelerates portions of your SQL queries directly on\nyour data lake. No need to move the data to a data warehouse.\n\n**[READ NOW](https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/papers/2022/sigmod_photon.pdf)**\n##### Photon: A Fast Query Engine for Lakehouse Systems\n\n[SIGMOD 2022 Best Industry Paper Award](https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/papers/2022/sigmod_photon.pdf)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Did you know?**\n\nDatabricks SQL warehouses scale automatically throughout the day to\nbetter suit your business needs. Administration is simplified by identifying\nhow many clusters can scale out with min and max, and Databricks SQL will\nauto-scale as needed. This ensures that you have ample compute to serve\nyour needs, without overprovisioning. Administrators appreciate the ability\nto have better control over consumption costs, while users appreciate that\ntheir queries process as fast and efficiently as possible. For most BI and\nanalytics use cases, using medium-size warehouses with scaling is a great\nbalance of price/performance that fits most business needs.\n\nIn the next section, we will discuss examples of Databricks SQL performance results\non large-scale analytic workloads as well as highly concurrent workloads.\n\n\nRunning Scheduled Starting Cluster Scale\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Large query performance: the fastest data warehouse\n\n\nThe industry standard benchmark used by data warehouses is TPC-DS. It includes\n100 queries that range from very simple to very sophisticated to simulate decision\nsupport workloads. This benchmark was created by a committee formed by\ndata warehousing vendors. The chart at right shows price/performance results\nrunning the 100TB version of TPC-DS, since for large workloads the numbers that\nultimately matter pertain to the performance cost. As you can see, Databricks SQL\noutperforms all cloud data warehouses we have measured.\n\n**[LEARN MORE](https://dbricks.co/benchmark)**\n\n**Did you know?**\n\n\n**$2,000**\n\n**$1,791**\n\n**$1,500**\n\n**$1,000**\n\n**$952**\n\n\n**$500**\n\n\n**$242**\n**$146**\n\n\n**$358**\n\n\n**$0**\nDatabricks SQL Databricks SQL Cloud Data Cloud Data Cloud Data\nSpot On-Demand Warehouse 1 Warehouse 2 Warehouse 3\n\nSystem\n\n100TB TPC-DS price/performance benchmark (lower is better).\n\n\nDatabricks SQL has set a [new world record in](http://tpc.org/5013)\n[100TB TPC-DS](http://tpc.org/5013) , the gold standard performance\nbenchmark for data warehousing. Databricks\nSQL outperformed the previous record by 2.2x.\nAnd this result has been formally audited and\nreviewed by the TPC council.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Highly concurrent analytics workloads\n\nBeyond large queries, it is also common for highly concurrent analytics workloads\nto execute over small data sets. To optimize concurrency, we used the same\nTPC-DS benchmark, but on a much smaller scale (10GB) and with 32 concurrent\nstreams. We analyzed the results to identify and remove bottlenecks, and\nbuilt hundreds of optimizations to improve concurrency. Databricks SQL now\noutperforms some of the best cloud data warehouses for both large queries and\nsmall queries with lots of users.\n\nReal-world workloads, however, are not just about either large or small queries.\nDatabricks SQL also provides intelligent workload management with a dual\nqueuing system and highly parallel reads.\n\n\n16,523\n\n12,248\n\n###### ~3X\n\n4,672\n\n\n11,690\n\n\nJuly 2020\n\n\nJan 2021 Oct 2022\n\n\nCLOUD DW X SQL WAREHOUSE X - L SIZE\n\n10GB TPC-DS queries/hr at 32 concurrent streams (higher is better).\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Intelligent workload management with smart  queuing system\n\nReal-world workloads typically include a mix of small and large queries. Therefore\nthe smart queuing and load balancing capabilities of Databricks SQL need to\naccount for that too. Databrick SQL uses a smart dual queuing system (in preview)\nthat prioritizes small queries over large, as analysts typically care more about the\nlatency of short queries than large ones.\n\n\n##### Highly parallel reads with improved I/O performance\n\nIt is common for some tables in a lakehouse to be composed of many files ‚Äî for\nexample, in streaming scenarios such as IoT ingest when data arrives continuously.\nIn legacy systems, the execution engine can spend far more time listing these\nfiles than actually executing the query. Our customers told us they do not want to\nsacrifice performance for data freshness. With async and highly parallel I/O, when\nexecuting a query, Databricks SQL now automatically reads the next blocks of data\nfrom cloud storage while the current block is being processed. This considerably\nincreases overall query performance on small files (by 12x for 1MB files) and ‚Äúcold\ndata‚Äù (data that is not cached) use cases as well.\n\n**[LEARN MORE](https://databricks.com/blog/2021/09/08/new-performance-improvements-in-databricks-sql.html)**\n\n\n-----\n\n###### PART 3: CONSUMPTION LAYER\n\n\nThe third layer of the Databricks Lakehouse Platform would similarly have to bridge\nthe best of both data lakes and data warehouses. In the lakehouse, you would\nhave to be able to work seamlessly with your tools of choice ‚Äî whether you are a\nbusiness analyst, data scientist, or ML or data engineer.\n\n\nThe lakehouse must treat Python, Scala, R and SQL programming languages\nand ecosystems as first-class citizens to truly unify data engineering, ML and BI\nworkloads in one place.\n\n\n**Consumption layer attributes ‚Äî data lake vs. data warehouse vs. data lakehouse**\n\n|Data Lake Notebooks (great for data scientists)|Data Warehouse Lack of support for data science/ML|Data Lakehouse Notebooks (great for data scientists)|\n|---|---|---|\n|Openness with rich ecosystem (Python, R, Scala)|Limited to SQL only|Openness with rich ecosystem (Python, R, Scala)|\n|BI/SQL not 1st-class citizen|BI/SQL 1st-class citizen|BI/SQL 1st-class citizen|\n||||\n\n\n-----\n\n##### A platform for your tools of choice\n\n\nAt Databricks we believe strongly in open platforms and meeting our customers where they are. We work very\nclosely with a large number of software vendors to make sure you can easily use your tools of choice\non Databricks, like [Tableau](https://databricks.com/blog/2021/05/07/improved-tableau-databricks-connector-with-azure-ad-authentication-support.html) , [Power BI](https://databricks.com/blog/2021/02/26/announcing-general-availability-ga-of-the-power-bi-connector-for-databricks.html) or [dbt](https://databricks.com/blog/2021/12/06/deploying-dbt-on-databricks-just-got-even-simpler.html) . With [Partner Connect](https://www.databricks.com/partnerconnect) , it‚Äôs easier than ever to connect with\nyour favorite tools, easier to get data in, easier to authenticate using single sign-on, and of course, with all the\nconcurrency and performance improvements, we make sure that the direct and live query experience is great.\n\n\n**Now more than ever, organizations**\n\n**need a data strategy that enables**\n\n**speed and agility to be adaptable.**\n\n**As organizations are rapidly moving**\n\n**their data to the cloud, we‚Äôre**\n\n**seeing growing interest in doing**\n\n**analytics on the data lake. The**\n\n**introduction of Databricks SQL**\n\n**delivers an entirely new experience**\n\n**for customers to tap into insights**\n\n**from massive volumes of data with**\n\n**the performance, reliability and**\n\n**scale they need. We‚Äôre proud to**\n\n**partner with Databricks to bring**\n\n**that opportunity to life.**\n\n**Francois Ajenstat**\nChief Product Officer, Tableau\n\n\n+ Any other Apache Spark-compatible client\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Faster BI results retrieval with Cloud Fetch\n\nOnce query results are computed, cloud data warehouses often collect and\nstream back results to BI clients on a single thread. This can create a bottleneck\nand greatly slows down the experience if you are fetching anything more than a\nfew megabytes of results in size. To provide analysts with the best experience\nfrom their favorite BI tools, we also needed to speed up how the system delivers\nresults to BI tools like Power BI or Tableau once computed.\n\nThat‚Äôs why we‚Äôve reimagined this approach with a new architecture called\n[Cloud Fetch](https://databricks.com/blog/2021/08/11/how-we-achieved-high-bandwidth-connectivity-with-bi-tools.html) . For large results, Databricks SQL now writes results in parallel across\nall of the compute nodes to cloud storage, and then sends the list of files using\npre-signed URLs back to the client. The client then can download in parallel\nall the data from cloud storage. This approach provides up to 10x performance\nimprovement in real-world scenarios.\n\n\nparallel\ndata\ntransfers\n\n\nCloud Storage\n\n**Cluster**\n\n\nSQL Endpoint\n\n\nCUSTOMER BENCHMARK\nTABLEAU EXTRACT\n\n\nCloud Fetch enables faster, higher-bandwidth connectivity to and from your BI tools.\n**[LEARN MORE](https://databricks.com/blog/2021/08/11/how-we-achieved-high-bandwidth-connectivity-with-bi-tools.html)**\n\n\n-----\n\n##### A first-class SQL development experience\n\nIn addition to supporting your favorite tools, we\nare also focused on providing a native first-class\nSQL development experience. We‚Äôve talked to\nhundreds of analysts using various SQL editors\nlike SQL Workbench every day, and worked with\nthem to provide the dream set of capabilities\nfor SQL development.\n\nFor example, Databricks SQL now supports\n[standard ANSI SQL](https://databricks.com/blog/2021/11/16/evolution-of-the-sql-language-at-databricks-ansi-standard-by-default-and-easier-migrations-from-data-warehouses.html) , so you don‚Äôt need to learn a\nspecial SQL dialect. Query tabs allow you to work\non multiple queries at once, autosave gives you\npeace of mind so you never have to worry about\nlosing your drafts, integrated history lets you\neasily look at what you have run in the past, and\nintelligent auto-complete understands subqueries\nand aliases for a delightful experience.\n\n\nThe built-in SQL query editor allows you to quickly explore available databases, query and visualize results.\n\n\n-----\n\nFinally, with Databricks SQL, analysts can easily\nmake sense of query results through a wide variety\nof rich visualizations and quickly build dashboards\nwith an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. To keep\neveryone current, dashboards can be shared and\nconfigured to automatically refresh, as well as to\nalert the team to meaningful changes in the data.\n\n\nEasily combine visualizations to build rich dashboards that can be shared with stakeholders.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Conclusion\n\nDatabricks SQL leverages open source standard [Delta Lake](https://databricks.com/product/delta-lake-on-databricks) to turn raw data\ninto actionable data, combining the flexibility and openness of data lakes\nwith the reliability and performance of data warehouses. The Unity Catalog\nprovides fine-grained governance on the lakehouse across all clouds using\none friendly interface and standard SQL.\n\nDatabricks SQL also holds the [new world record in 100TB TPC-DS](https://dbricks.co/benchmark) , the gold\nstandard performance benchmark for data warehousing. It is powered by\nPhoton, the new vectorized query engine for the lakehouse, and by SQL\nwarehouses for instant, elastic compute decoupled from storage.\n\nFinally, Databricks SQL offers a native first-class SQL development\nexperience, with a built-in SQL editor, rich visualizations and dashboards,\nand integrates seamlessly with your favorite BI- and SQL-based tools for\nmaximum productivity.\n\n\nDatabricks SQL under the hood.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Atlassian\n\n\nAtlassian is a leading provider of collaboration, development and issue-tracking\n\nsoftware for teams.

Retailers have improved the shopping experience with personalized recommendations, financial institutions have strengthened risk management through the use of advanced analytics, and the healthcare industry is tapping into the power of machine learning to predict and prevent chronic disease. The public sector is no exception.\n\n\nIn 2018, the U.S. Federal Government embarked on one of its most ambitious\nefforts since putting a man on the moon ‚Äî embedding data into all aspects of\ndecision-making. By enacting the Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018,\nCongress set in motion requirements for agencies to modernize their data and\nanalytics capabilities, including the appointment of agency-level chief data\nofficers. A year later came the Federal Data Strategy, which provided further\nguidance for how agencies should manage and use data by 2030.\n\n\nWith all of this guidance, agencies are starting to make meaningful improvements\nto their data strategy, but when it comes to innovating with data, agencies still\nlag behind the private sector. This begs the question: what‚Äôs standing in the way?\nThe hurdles aren‚Äôt due to a lack of effort on the part of agency leaders. In fact,\nthey can largely be attributed to a patchwork of legacy technologies that have\nbeen amassed over the last 30 to 40 years. While these hurdles stand in the\nway, a number of innovative agencies are making significant progress as they\nembrace new data and AI capabilities.\n\n\n-----\n\nFederal spending on artificial intelligence rose to [nearly $1 billion](https://www.federaltimes.com/thought-leadership/2021/09/28/why-the-government-market-for-artificial-intelligence-technology-is-expanding/) in 2020, up\n50% from 2018. There‚Äôs a good reason for this level of spend: Deloitte recently\npublished a report, ‚ÄúAI-augmented Government,‚Äù that estimates the federal\ngovernment could free up as many as 1.2 billion hours of work and save up to\n$41.1 billion annually through the use of AI-driven automation. Early adopters\nof advanced analytics are starting to see the fruits of their labor. For example,\n[USCIS modernized their analytics stack](https://databricks.com/customers/uscis) on Databricks to accelerate insights\non applicants by 24x, automate the processing of millions of applications,\nand reduce appointment no-show rates with predictive analytics.

Building on that foundation, agencies are starting to adopt advanced analytics and AI to automate costly, outdated and resource-intensive operations as well as improve decisionmaking with predictive insights that can better keep pace with the dynamic needs of citizens and global communities. That being said, there are a number of barriers standing in their way.\n\n##### Common challenges\n\n\nMany government agencies are burdened with a legacy IT infrastructure that is\nbuilt with on-premises data warehouses that are complex to maintain, are costly\nto scale as compute is coupled with storage, and lack support for unstructured\ndata and advanced analytics. This severely inhibits data-driven innovation.\nMaintaining these systems requires a massive investment of both time and\nmoney compared to modern cloud-based systems and creates a number of\navoidable challenges:\n\n\ngovernment is often done in weekly or daily batches, but decision-making\nneeds to happen in real time. Critical events like cyber attacks and health\npandemics can‚Äôt wait a week.\n\n**Lack of citizen insights**\n\nWhen data is siloed, teams get an incomplete view of the citizen,\nresulting in missed opportunities to improve the delivery of services that\nimpact the quality of life for their constituents.\n\n\n**Lack of reliability**\n\n\nSiloed systems result in data replication as teams spin up new data marts\nto support their one-off use cases. Without a single source of truth, teams\nstruggle with data inconsistencies, which can result in inaccurate analysis\nand model performance that is only compounded over time.\n\n**Lack of agility**\n\nDisjointed analytics tools and legacy infrastructure hinder the ability of\nteams to conduct real-time analytics. Most data processing in the\n\n\n**Lack of productivity**\n\nData scientists and data analysts alike must have the right tool set to\ncollaboratively investigate, extract and report meaningful insights from\ntheir data. Unfortunately, data silos lead to organizational silos, which make\ncollaboration inside an agency as well as between agencies very difficult.\nWith different groups of data teams leveraging their own coding and\nanalytical tools, communicating insights and working across teams ‚Äî\nlet alone across agencies ‚Äî is almost impossible. This lack of collaboration\ncan drastically limit the capabilities of any data analytics or AI initiative.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Introducing the Lakehouse for Public Sector\n\n\nThe reason that the Databricks Lakehouse is\nable to deliver the simplicity, flexibility and\nspeed that a government agency requires is\nthat it fundamentally reimagines the modern\ndata architecture. Databricks provides federal,\nstate and local agencies with a cloud-native\nLakehouse Platform that combines the best\nof data warehouses and data lakes ‚Äî to store\nand manage all your data for all your analytics\nworkloads. With this modern architecture,\nagencies can federate all their data and\ndemocratize access for downstream use\ncases, empowering their teams to deliver on\ntheir mission objectives by unlocking the full\npotential of their data.\n\n\n**Delivering real-time data insight in support of the mission**\n\n-  Fraud, Waste & Abuse\n\n-  Cybersecurity\n\n-  Medicaid Dashboards &\nReporting\n\n-  Process Improvement\n\n-  Predictive Maintenance\n\n-  SCM & Demand Forecasting\n\n-  Smart Military/Censor Data\n\n-  Military Heatlh\n\n-  COVID Response/Decision\nSupport\n\n-  Smart Cities/Connected\nVehicles\n\n-  Citizen Engagement\n\n-  Data-Driven Decision-Making\n\n\n-----\n\n**Federate all of your agency‚Äôs data**\n\nAny type of data can be stored because, like a data lake, the Databricks\nLakehouse is built using the low-cost object storage supported by cloud\nproviders. Leveraging this capability helps break down the data silos that\nhinder efforts to aggregate data for advanced analytics (e.g., predictive\nmaintenance) or compute-intensive workloads like detecting cyber\nthreats across billions of signals. Probably even more important is the\nability of the lakehouse architecture to travel back in time, ensuring full\naudit compliance and high governance standards for analytics and AI.\n\n**Power real-time decision-making**\n\nStreaming use cases such as IoT analytics or disease spread tracking is\nsimpler to support because the lakehouse uses Apache Spark TM as the\ndata processing engine and Delta Lake as a storage layer. With Spark,\nyou can toggle between batch and streaming workloads with just a line\nof code. With Delta Lake, native support for ACID transactions means\nthat you can deploy streaming workloads without the overhead of\ncommon reliability and performance issues. These capabilities make\nreal-time analytics possible.\n\n\n**Unlock collaborative analytics for all personas**\n\nThe Databricks Lakehouse for Public Sector is your one-stop shop for\nall your analytics and AI. The platform includes a business intelligence\ncapability ‚Äî Databricks SQL ‚Äî that empowers data analysts to query and run\nreports against all of an agency‚Äôs unified data. Databricks SQL integrates with\nBI tools like Tableau and Microsoft Power BI and complements any existing BI\ntools with a SQL-native interface, allowing data analysts and data scientists\nto query data directly within Databricks and build powerful dashboards.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Deliver on your mission with predictive insights**\nIn the same environment, data scientists can build, share and collaborate\non machine learning models for advanced use cases like fraud detection\nor geospatial analytics. Additionally, MLflow, an open source toolkit for\nmanaging the ML lifecycle, is built into the Lakehouse so data scientists\ncan manage everything in one place. Databricks natively supports Python,\nR, SQL and Scala so practitioners can work together with the languages and\nlibraries of their choice, reducing the need for separate tools. With these\ncapabilities, data teams can turn insights from real-world data into powerful\nvisualizations designed for machine learning. Visualizations can then be\nturned into interactive dashboards to share insights with peers across\nagencies, policymakers, regulators and decision-makers.\n\n\n##### Customers That Innovate With Databricks Lakehouse for Public Sector\n\nSome of the top government agencies in the world turn to the\nDatabricks Lakehouse for Public Sector to bring analytics and AI-driven\nautomation and innovation to the communities they serve.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### USE CASE:\n## Cybersecurity\n\n##### Overview\n\n\n**Limited window of data**\nGiven the high cost of storage, most agencies retain only a few weeks of threat\ndata. This can be a real problem in scenarios where a perpetrator gains access\nto a network but waits months before doing anything malicious. Without a long\nhistorical record, security teams can‚Äôt analyze cyberattacks over long-term\nhorizons or conduct deep forensic reviews.\n\n##### Solution overview\n\nFor government agencies that are ready to modernize their security data\ninfrastructure and analyze data at petabyte-scale more cost-effectively,\nDatabricks provides an open lakehouse platform that augments existing SIEMs\nto help democratize access to data for downstream analytics and AI. Built\non Apache Spark and Delta Lake, Databricks is optimized to process large\nvolumes of streaming and historic data for real-time threat analysis and incident\nresponse. Security teams can query threat data going years into the past in just\nminutes and build ML models to detect new threat patterns and reduce false\npositives. Additionally, Databricks created a Splunk-certified add-on to augment\nSplunk for Enterprise Security (ES) for cost-efficient log and retention expansion.\n\n\nCyberattacks from bad actors and nation states are a huge and growing threat\nto government agencies. Recent large-scale attacks like the ones on SolarWinds,\nlog4j, Colonial Pipeline and HAFNIUM highlight the sophistication and increasing\nfrequency of broad-reaching cyberattacks. Data breaches cost the federal\ngovernment more than $4 million per incident in 2021 and threaten national\nsecurity. Staying ahead of the next threat requires continuous monitoring of\nsecurity data from an agency‚Äôs entire attack surface before, during and after\nan incident.\n\n##### Challenges\n\n**Scaling existing SIEM solutions**\nAgencies looking to expand existing SIEM tools for today‚Äôs petabytes of data can\nexpect increased licensing, storage, compute and integration resources resulting\nin tens of millions of dollars in additional costs per year.\n\n**Rules-based systems**\nMany legacy SIEM tools lack the critical analytics capabilities ‚Äî such as\nadvanced analytics, graph processing and machine learning ‚Äî needed to detect\nunknown threat patterns or deliver on a broader set of security use cases like\nbehavioral analytics.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### How to get started\n\n[Solution Accelerator: Detect Criminal](https://databricks.com/blog/2020/10/05/detecting-criminals-and-nation-states-through-dns-analytics.html)\n[Threats Using DNS Analytics](https://databricks.com/blog/2020/10/05/detecting-criminals-and-nation-states-through-dns-analytics.html)\n\nDetecting criminals and nation states through DNS analytics. In order to address\ncommon cybersecurity challenges such as deployment complexity, tech\nlimitation and cost, security teams need a real-time data analytics platform that\ncan handle cloud scale, analyze data wherever it is, natively support streaming\nand batch analytics, and have collaborative content development capabilities.\n\n\n##### Customer story\n\n**[WATCH THE VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BRGqxq4iQw)**\n\n**Fighting Cyber Threats in Real Time**\nSince partnering with Databricks, HSBC has reduced costs, accelerated threat\ndetection and response, and improved their security posture. Not only can\nthey process all of their required data, but they‚Äôve also increased online query\nretention from just days to months at petabyte scale. HSBC is now able to\nexecute 2-3x more threat hunts per analyst.\n\n\n[Solution Accelerator:](https://databricks.com/blog/2021/07/23/augment-your-siem-for-cybersecurity-at-cloud-scale.html)\n[Databricks Add-On for Splunk](https://databricks.com/blog/2021/07/23/augment-your-siem-for-cybersecurity-at-cloud-scale.html)\n\nDesigned for cloud-scale security operations, the add-on provides Splunk\nanalysts with access to all data stored in the Lakehouse. Bidirectional pipelines\nbetween Splunk and Databricks allow agency analysts to integrate directly into\nSplunk visualizations and security workflows.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Reference architecture\n\n\n-----\n\n###### USE CASE:\n## Predictive Maintenance\n\n##### Overview\n\n\n**Integrating unstructured data**\nEquipment data doesn‚Äôt just come in the form of IoT data. Agencies can gather\nrich unstructured signals like audio, visual (e.g., video inspections) and text\n(e.g., maintenance logs). Most legacy data architectures are unable to integrate\nstructured and unstructured data sources.\n\n**Operationalizing machine learning**\nMost agencies lack the advanced analytics tools needed to build models that\ncan predict potential equipment failures. Those that do typically have their\ndata scientists working in a siloed set of tools, resulting in unnecessary data\nreplication and inefficient workflows.\n\n##### Solution overview\n\nThe Databricks Lakehouse is tailor-made for building IoT applications at scale.\nWith Databricks, agencies can easily manage large streaming volumes of small\nfiles, with ACID transaction guarantees and reduced job fails compared to\ntraditional data warehouse architectures. Additionally, the Lakehouse is cloud\nnative and built on Apache Spark, so scaling for petabytes of data is not an issue.\nWith the Lakehouse, agencies can bring together all of their structured and\nunstructured data with a unified set of tooling for data engineering, model building\nand production rollout. With these capabilities, operations teams can quickly\ndetect and act on pending equipment failures before they affect performance.\n\n\nPredictive maintenance is oftentimes associated with the manufacturing sector,\nbut in reality it extends far beyond the factory floor. Consider this for a moment:\nthe U.S. Government operates a fleet of over [640,000 vehicles](https://www.government-fleet.com/301786/federal-vs-state-local-fleets) including public\nbuses, postal delivery trucks, drones, helicopters and jet fighters. Many of these\nvehicles ‚Äî like multimillion-dollar aircraft ‚Äî contain sensors that generate\nmassive amounts of data on the use and conditions of various components. And\nit‚Äôs not just vehicles. Modern public utilities stream data through connected IoT\ndevices. All of this data can be analyzed to identify the root cause of a failure\nand predict future maintenance, helping to avoid costly repairs and critical\nassets from being out of service.\n\n##### Challenges\n\n**Managing IoT data at scale**\nWith billions of sensors generating information, most data systems are unable to\nhandle the sheer volume of data. Before agencies can even start analyzing their\ndata, legacy data warehouse‚Äìbased tools require preprocessing of data, making\nreal-time analysis impossible.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### How to get started\n\n\n**Solution Accelerator: Predictive Maintenance**\nLearn how to ingest real-time IoT data from field devices, perform complex\ntime series processing in Delta Lake and leverage machine learning to build\npredictive maintenance models.\n\n[Part 1: Use case overview](https://databricks.com/blog/2020/08/03/modern-industrial-iot-analytics-on-azure-part-1.html)\n\n[Part 2: Ingest real-time IoT data and perform time series processing](https://databricks.com/blog/2020/08/11/modern-industrial-iot-analytics-on-azure-part-2.html)\n\n[Part 3: Using ML to predict maintenance.](https://databricks.com/blog/2020/08/20/modern-industrial-iot-analytics-on-azure-part-3.html)\n\n\n[Watch the Demo:](https://vimeo.com/580864758/5a5bc42bb9)\n[Predictive Maintenance on Azure Databricks](https://vimeo.com/580864758/5a5bc42bb9)\n\n##### Customer story\n\n**[LEARN MORE](https://www.tallan.com/blog/client-stories/dc-water/)**\n\n**Protecting the Water Supply for 700,000 Residents**\nUtilizing machine learning for predictive analytics to help stop water main\nbreaks before they occur, potentially saving hundreds of thousands of dollars\nin repairs while reducing service interruption.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Reference architecture\n\nWeather Sensor\nReadings\n(semi-structured)\n\nReal-time\nstreaming\n\nWind Turbine\nTelematics\n(semi-structured)\n\nMaintenance Logs\n(unstructured)\n\n\n#### Databricks Lakehouse Platform\n\nBronze Layer Silver Layer Gold Layer\n\n\nAppend Raw\nMerge Data\nData\n\n\nJoin Streams and\nAnalyze Data\n\nEnriched\nReadings\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nBuild Predictive\nMaintenance Model\n\n\nGranular\nReadings\n\n\nAggregated\nHourly\nReadings\n\n\nReal-time Dashboards for Real-Time Dashboards for\nOptimizing Performance Optimizing Performance\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|\n|---|---|---|\n\n\n-----\n\n###### USE CASE:\n## Fraud Detection\n\n\n##### Overview\n\nAccording to [McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Public%20Sector/Our%20Insights/Cracking%20down%20on%20government%20fraud%20with%20data%20analytics/Cracking-down-on-government-fraud-with-data-analytics-vF.pdf) , more than half of the federal government‚Äôs\nmonetary losses to fraud, waste and abuse go undetected and total tens of\nbillions of dollars. Financial fraud comes in many forms, from individuals taking\nadvantage of relief programs to complex networks of criminal organizations\nworking together to falsify medical claims and rebate forms. Investigative teams\nhoping to stay ahead of fraudsters need advanced analytics techniques so they\ncan detect anomalous behavior buried in a sea of data.\n\n##### Challenges\n\n**Lack of machine learning**\nA rules-based approach is not enough. Bad actors are getting more and more\nsophisticated in how they take advantage of government programs, necessitating\nan AI-driven approach.\n\n**Unreliable data**\nGetting high-quality, clean data and maintaining a rich feature store is critical\nfor identifying ever-evolving fraud patterns while maintaining a strict record of\nprevious data points.\n\n\n##### Solution overview\n\nThe Databricks Lakehouse enables teams to develop complex ML models with\nhigh governance standards and bridge the gap between data science and\ntechnology to address the challenge of analyzing large volumes of data at scale\n‚Äî 40 billion financial transactions a year are made in the United States alone.\nAdditionally, Databricks makes it possible to combine modern AI techniques\nwith the legacy rules-based methods that underpin current approaches to fraud\ndetection all within a common and efficient Spark-based orchestration engine.\n\n##### How to get started\n\n[Solution Accelerator: Fraud Detection](https://databricks.com/blog/2021/01/19/combining-rules-based-and-ai-models-to-combat-financial-fraud.html)\n\nDue to an ever-changing landscape, building a financial fraud detection\nframework often goes beyond just creating a highly accurate machine learning\nmodel. Oftentimes it involves a complex-decision science setup that combines\na rules engine with a need for a robust and scalable machine learning platform.\nIn this example, we show how to build a holistic fraud detection solution on\nDatabricks using data from a financial institution.\n\n\n**Analytics at scale**\nTraining complex ML models with hundreds of features on gigabytes of\nstructured, semi-structured and unstructured data can be impossible without a\nhighly scalable and distributed infrastructure.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Customer story\n\n**[WATCH THE VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca1MMNpBSHM)**\n\n**Identifying Financial Fraud at Scale**\nProcesses hundreds of billions of market events\nper day on the Databricks Lakehouse and uses\nthe power of machine learning to identify illicit\nactivity in near real-time.\n\n\n##### Reference architecture\n\n\n-----\n\n###### USE CASE:\n## Money Laundering\n\n##### Overview\n\n\nApproximately [$300 billion](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/2018NMLRA_12-18.pdf) is laundered through the United States each year,\nand with criminal organizations ‚Äî both at home and abroad ‚Äî implementing\nincreasingly sophisticated methods for laundering funds, it‚Äôs getting harder to\nstop. While the federal government continues to apply pressure on the financial\nsector through heightened regulation, more is needed to combat laundering.\nModern AI techniques such as graph analytics and computer vision can be\nused to process different types of structured (e.g., financial transactions) and\nunstructured (e.g., real estate images) data and identify illicit behavior. This\nallows investigative teams to automate labor-intensive activities like confirming\na residential address or reviewing transaction histories, and instead dig into\npriority threats.\n\n##### Challenges\n\n**Complex data science**\nModern anti-money laundering (AML) practices require multiple ML capabilities\nsuch as entity resolution, computer vision and graph analytics on entity\nmetadata, which is typically not supported by any one data platform.\n\n\n**Time-consuming false positives**\nAny reported suspicious activity must be investigated manually to ensure\naccuracy. Many legacy solutions generate a high number of false positives or fail\nto identify unknown patterns, resulting in wasted effort by investigators.\n\n##### Solution overview\n\nAML solutions face the operational burden of processing billions of transactions\na day. The Databricks Lakehouse Platform combines the low storage cost\nbenefits of cloud data lakes with the robust transaction capabilities of data\nwarehouses, making it the ideal foundation for building AML analytics at massive\nscale. At the core of Databricks is Delta Lake, which can store and combine\nboth unstructured and structured data to build entity relationships; moreover,\nDatabricks Delta Engine provides efficient access using the new Photon compute\nto speed up BI queries on tables spanning billions of transactions. On top of\nthese capabilities, ML is a first-class citizen in the Lakehouse, which means\nanalysts and data scientists do not waste time subsampling or moving data to\nshare dashboards and stay one step ahead of bad actors.\n\n\n**Model transparency**\nAlthough AI can be used to address many money laundering use cases, the lack\nof transparency in the development of ML models offers little explainability,\ninhibiting broader adoption.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### How to get started\n\n[Solution Accelerator: Modern](https://databricks.com/blog/2021/07/16/aml-solutions-at-scale-using-databricks-lakehouse-platform.html)\n[Anti-Money Laundering Techniques](https://databricks.com/blog/2021/07/16/aml-solutions-at-scale-using-databricks-lakehouse-platform.html)\n\n\nLakehouse Platform leveraging a series of next-gen machine learning techniques\nincluding NLP, computer vision, entity resolution and graph analytics.

With support for a wide range of data formats and a rich and extensible\nset of data transformation and ML capabilities, Databricks enables agencies to\nbring together all of their data in a central location and move beyond simple\nrules-based methods for entity resolution. Data teams can easily explore\ndifferent machine learning techniques like natural language processing,\nclassification and graph analytics to automate entity matching. And one-click\nprovisioning and deprovisioning of cloud resources makes it easy for teams to\ncost-effectively allocate the necessary compute resources for any size job so\nthey can uncover findings faster.\n\n\nEntity analytics aims to connect disparate data sources to build a full view of\na person or an organization. This has many applications in the public sector,\nsuch as fraud detection, national security and population health. For example,\nMedicare fraud teams need to understand which prescriptions are filled, claims\nfiled and facilities visited across geographies to uncover suspicious behavior.\nBefore teams can even look for suspicious behavior, they must first determine\nwhich records are associated. In the United States, nearly 50,000 people share\nthe name John Smith (and there are thousands of others with similar names).\nImagine trying to identify the right John Smith for this type of analysis. That‚Äôs no\neasy task.\n\n##### Challenges\n\n**Disjointed data**\nManaging complex and brittle ETL pipelines in order to cleanse and join data\nacross siloed systems and data stores.\n\n\n**Compute intensive**\nIdentifying related entities across population-level data sets requires massive\ncompute power that far outstrips legacy on-prem data architectures.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### How to get started\n\n[Virtual Workshop: Entity Analytics](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wGGT9Fn5EZF5Rgrabuttt1xdua5csrBa/view?usp=sharing)\n\nLearn from Databricks experts on how entity analytics is being deployed\nin the public sector and watch a demo that shows how to use ML to link\npayments and treatments across millions of records in a public CMS data set.\n\n[Solution Accelerator:](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a5xdaRSNQjQvgztOZg0tCiCajjVpvVPA/view?usp=sharing)\n[Machine Learning-Based Item Matching](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a5xdaRSNQjQvgztOZg0tCiCajjVpvVPA/view?usp=sharing)\n\nWhile focused on retail, this accelerator has applications for any organization\nworking on entity matching, especially as it relates to items that might be stored\nacross locations.

Built on\nApache Spark, the Lakehouse easily scales for data sets consisting of billions\nof rows of data with distributed processing in the cloud. To expand on the core\ncapabilities of the Lakehouse, Databricks has introduced the Mosaic library,\nan extension to the Apache Spark framework, built for fast and easy processing\nof large geospatial data sets. Popular frameworks such as Apache Sedona or\nGeoMesa can still be used alongside Mosaic, and because Mosaic sits on top of\nLakehouse architecture, it unlocks AI/ML and advanced analytics capabilities\nto support all types of geospatial use cases.\n\n\nEvery day billions of handheld and IoT devices, along with thousands of\nairborne and satellite remote sensing platforms, generate hundreds of exabytes\nof location-aware data. This boom of geospatial big data combined with\nadvancements in machine learning is enabling government agencies to develop\nnew capabilities. The potential use cases for geospatial analytics and AI touch\nevery part of the government, including disaster recovery (e.g., flood/earthquake\nmapping), defense and intel (e.g., detecting threats using drone footage),\ninfrastructure (e.g., public transportation planning), civilian safety (e.g., crime\nprediction), public health (e.g., disease spread tracking), and much more. Every\nagency at the state and federal level needs to consider how they can tap into\ngeospatial data.\n\n##### Challenges\n\n**Massive volumes of geospatial data**\nWith the proliferation of low-cost sensor arrays, GPS technologies and highresolution imaging organizations are collecting tens of TBs of geospatial data\ndaily, outpacing their ability to store and process this data at scale.\n\n\n**Compute-intensive spatial workloads**\nGeospatial data is complex in structure, with various formats not well suited for\nlegacy data warehouses, as well as being compute intensive, with geospatialspecific transformations and queries requiring hours and hours of compute.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### How to get started\n\n[Solution Accelerator:](https://databricks.com/blog/2022/05/02/high-scale-geospatial-processing-with-mosaic.html)\n[Mosaic for Geospatial Analytics](https://databricks.com/blog/2022/05/02/high-scale-geospatial-processing-with-mosaic.html)\n\nBuild a Lakehouse to support all of your geospatial analytics and AI use cases\nwith the Mosaic library.

Operating margins\nand growth are impacted by the rising cost of labor, materials, energy and transportation, all\npeaking at the same time. Disruptive events in the supply chain are increasing in frequency\nand intensity, leading to significant revenue losses and damaged brand reputation.\n\nEffective acquisition and retention of next-generation talent is a considerable issue for\nmanufacturers. There are more jobs in the industry than there are people to do them, further\ncompounding the problem of slower than expected industrial productivity growth over the\nlast 15 years. The industry is also one of the largest consumers of energy, and faces a direct\nchallenge of transforming operations to be more sustainable as governments are prioritizing\nnet-zero policies that require a step change in energy efficiency and transition to low-carbon\nenergy sources.\n\nThe manufacturing industry generates massive amounts of new data every day ‚Äî estimated\nto be two to four times more in size than in industries such as communications, media,\nretail and financial services. This explosion of data has opened the door for the global\nmanufacturing ecosystem to boost productivity, quality, sustainability and growth beyond\nwhat was previously thought possible.\n\nUnfortunately, legacy data warehouse-based architectures weren‚Äôt built for the massive\nvolumes and type of data coming in through today‚Äôs factories, products, processes and\nworkers, let alone to support the advanced AI/ML use cases required to meet the customer\nexpectations of shorter lead times, reliable delivery and smarter products.\n\n\n-----\n\nFor that, companies need to adopt a modern data architecture that provides the speed, scale and\ncollaboration needed by broad teams of data engineers, data scientists, and analysts. Manufacturers need\na comprehensive data platform that can not only handle massive volumes of data, but effectively and\nseamlessly operationalize the value from data, analytics and AI.\n\nThis is achieved by:\n\nRemoving data silos by placing all data, regardless of type or frequency, in a single, open\narchitecture ‚Äî including unstructured data from sensors, telemetry, natural language logs,\nvideos and images ‚Äî helping you to gain end-to-end visibility into your business\n\nEnsuring your data is ‚Äúalways on‚Äù so that the freshest and highest quality data is available for\nall for the full spectrum of enterprise analytics and AI/ML use cases, allowing you to drive ITOT convergence\n\nHaving a comprehensive open architecture so IT and data teams can move with agility\nto bring AI and ML to where it‚Äôs needed, when it‚Äôs needed, including in connectivityconstrained environments\n\nMaintaining fine-grained governance and access control on your data assets, protecting\n\nsensitive intellectual property and customer data\n\nThe Databricks Lakehouse for Manufacturing does just this. It‚Äôs a comprehensive approach that empowers\nteams in the industry to collaborate and innovate around data, analytics and AI. It eliminates the technical\nlimitations of legacy technologies and gives data teams the ability to drive deeper, end-to-end insight\ninto supply chains, automate processes to reduce costs and grow productivity, and achieve sustainable\ntransformation for a more prosperous future. Welcome to the Lakehouse for Manufacturing.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Manufacturing Transformation Trends\n\n\nThe future of manufacturing is smart, sustainable and service oriented. Today‚Äôs\nforward-thinking leaders are preparing the foundation they need to support that\nfuture by leveraging fast and connected data from all corners of the enterprise.\nThere are four key trends driving transformation in manufacturing:\n\n**Boosting industrial productivity through automation**\n\nA spike in labor costs, as well as the cost of energy and materials, puts significant\npressure on operating margins. At the same time, industrial productivity has\nplateaued ‚Äî it is at the same level today as it was in the late 2000s. In the face\nof these macro challenges and economic uncertainty, there has never been a\nmore burning need to reduce costs and improve productivity through greater\nvisibility and automation.\n\nThe industry has made strides in collecting data from machines and performing\npredictive analytics on sensor readings, with 47% of manufacturers citing the\nuse of predictive maintenance to reduce operational costs with considerable\nupside ahead.\n\nHowever, there is an entirely different class of unstructured data in the form of\nimages, videos and LiDAR that is opening the door to game-changing automation\nin quality inspection, flow optimization and production scheduling. Historically,\nthese critical processes have depended on manual and visual inspection of\nproducts and operations, which is resource intensive and less accurate than\nML-driven computer vision techniques. This untapped data and capability\nis allowing manufacturers to deliver higher product quality and deliver on\nproduction demands using fewer resources. Andrew Ng, a machine learning\n\n\npioneer, rightly describes the massive opportunity for these technologies in\nhis quote: ‚ÄúIt is incumbent on every CEO in any manufacturing or industrial\nautomation company to figure out how to make deep learning technology work\nfor your business.‚Äù\n\n**CUSTOMER STORY SPOTLIGHT:**\n##### Corning\n\n#### $2 million in cost avoidance through \n\nmanufacturing upset event reduction\n\n**Driving Better Efficiency in Manufacturing Process With ML**\n\nCorning has been one of the world‚Äôs leading innovators in materials science for\n\nnearly 200 years. Delivering high-quality products is a key objective across the\n\ncompany‚Äôs manufacturing facilities around the world, and it‚Äôs always on a mission\n\nto explore how ML can help deliver on that goal. Databricks has been central\n\nto the company‚Äôs digital transformation, as it provides a simplified and unified\n\nplatform where teams can centralize all data and ML work. Now, they can train\n\nmodels, register them in MLflow, generate all additional artifacts ‚Äî like exported\n\nformats ‚Äî and track them in the same place as the base model.\n\n[LEARN MORE](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/01/05/how-corning-built-end-end-ml-databricks-lakehouse-platform.html)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Gaining end-to-end operations and**\n**supply chain visibility**\n\nModern customer expectations are forcing manufacturers to focus on more\ncustomer-centric KPIs: quality, on-time commitments and speed of delivery.\nThat‚Äôs not to say that asset and labor efficiency are less important ‚Äî however,\nwith customer expectations of shorter lead times and more reliable delivery,\nthe success measures in manufacturing are shifting to a mantra of ‚Äúmeasure\nwhat your customer values.‚Äù\n\nHigh-performing manufacturers that embed this deep into their operational\nplaybook also perform best on productivity and ROIC growth results, as\nevidenced in a recent study by the World Economic Forum and the International\nCentre of Industrial Transformation. The problem? In a post-pandemic world,\noperations and supply chains are persistently constrained, with increasing\ndisruptions, spiraling costs and unpredictable performance. The business\nimpact is considerable ‚Äî studies have shown that a 30-day disruption can\nreduce EBITDA by 5% and impact annual revenue by as much as 20%.\n\nManufacturing companies need to be able to deliver on customer expectations,\ncommitments and service levels, all while lowering costs and increasing\nproductivity. Manufacturers need an enterprise data platform that can provide\nreal-time visibility into order flows, production processes, supplier performance,\ninventory and logistics execution, breaking down departmental silos to maximize\ncustomer responsiveness, improve manufacturing agility and boost performance.\n\n\n**Transforming your business model through**\n**tech-fueled services**\n\nServitization, defined as the process of building revenue streams from services,\nhas been trending for some time. The adaptation of the business model has\nbeen considerably profitable: on average, services account for ~30% of industrial\nmanufacturing companies but contribute 60%+ of profit.\n\nIn aftersale services, a clear customer preference for business outcome-based\nofferings has emerged in almost every corner of the manufacturing industry.\nThe use of data, analytics and AI is foundational to delivering more personalized\ncustomer outcomes, proactive field service delivery and differentiated missioncritical applications to their customers.\n\nWith greater autonomy, connectivity and sensorization, manufacturers operate\nin a paradigm where their products generate more and more data every second,\nopening up numerous new addressable opportunities for value creation. The\nbusiness of manufacturing is no longer linear, and manufacturers will need to\nreimagine their businesses to go beyond merely providing the primary unit of\nproduction ‚Äî the next SKU, machine, vehicle or airplane ‚Äî and leverage this data\nto operate a platform business with higher growth, stickier revenue streams and\ngreater resilience to demand shocks.\n\n\n-----\n\n**CUSTOMER STORY SPOTLIGHT:**\n##### Rolls-Royce\n\n**Aerospace Goes Green With Data and AI**\n\nWhile most people think of luxury cars when they hear ‚ÄúRolls-Royce,‚Äù the\n\nCivil Aerospace branch is its own company, having separated from the car\n\nmanufacturing arm in 1971. The now wildly successful manufacturer of commercial\n\nairplane engines is a leader in its industry for innovation.

This growth in multi-modal data from IoT sensors,\nprocess historians, product telemetry, images, cameras and perception systems\nhas outpaced legacy data warehouse-centric technologies. On-prem and cloud\ndata warehouse tech-based architectures are too complex and too costly for the\nlarge and heterogeneous data sets prevalent in the industry.\n\n**Driving IT-OT convergence**\n\nThe success and pace of data modernization efforts in manufacturing is so often\nmuted by critical data being stuck in multiple closed systems and proprietary\nformats, making it difficult and cost-prohibitive to extract the full potential of IT\nand OT data sets. In addition, data quality issues such as outdated or inaccurate\ndata can often lead to a disjointed and incomplete view of customers, operations\nand assets. For years, companies have lacked a common foundation for complex\nand heterogeneous manufacturing data ‚Äî from IoT-generated data streams to\nfinancial metrics stored in ERP applications ‚Äî and it has impacted their ability to\nprovide the freshest, highest-quality and most complete data for analytics.\n\n\n**Bringing AI/ML to where it‚Äôs needed**\n\nTo realize the promise of AI/ML in manufacturing, machine learning models need\nto be brought as close to the decision as possible, often at the edge in facilities\nand locations with limited or intermittent connectivity to the internet or cloud.\nThis requires deployment flexibility to on-premises or edge devices, with an\nexperience comparable to that in the cloud.\n\n**Inability to innovate at scale**\n\nCDOs want to be able to quickly and efficiently reproduce successes at global\nscale. Technical and business users want to simply and quickly know what data\nsets are available to solve the business issue at hand. Analysts want flexibility to\nuse the tools they are most familiar with in order to stay responsive to business\nneeds. Fragmented approaches to architecture and tooling make scaling\nbusiness impact very difficult, which results in talent churn, slower development\nand duplicative efforts ‚Äî all leading to higher costs.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Databricks Lakehouse for Manufacturing\n\n**Deliver personalized outcomes and frictionless experiences**\n\n**Millions of assets streaming IoT data**\n\n**5%‚Äì10% reduction in unplanned downtime and cost**\n\n**Accurate prices across 1,000s of locations and millions of dealers**\n\n**200%+ increase in offer conversion rates**\n\nWith Databricks Lakehouse for Manufacturing, manufacturers can gain a\nsingle view of their customers that combines data from each stage of the\ncustomer journey.

Today, Overall Equipment\nEffectiveness (OEE) is considered the standard for measuring manufacturing\nequipment productivity. According to Engineering USA, an OEE value of 85% or\nabove is considered world-leading. However, many manufacturers typcially achieve\na range of between 40% and 60%. Reasons for underachievement often include:\n\n**‚Ä¢** Delayed inputs due to manual processes that are prone to human error\n\n**‚Ä¢** Bottlenecks created by data silos, impeding the flow of fresh data to\nstakeholders\n\n**‚Ä¢** A lack of collaboration capabilities, keeping stakeholders from working on the\nsame information at the same time\n\n**Poor OEE value** **can be a result of poor parts quality, slow**\n**production performance and production availability issues.**\n\nDatabricks Lakehouse can help manufacturers maneuver through the\nchallenges of ingesting and converging operational technology (OT) data with\ntraditional data from IT systems to build forecasting solutions.\n\n**C O M M O N U S E C A S E S**\n\nIncrementally ingest and process sensor data from IoT devices\nin a variety of formats\n\nCompute and surface KPIs and metrics to drive valuable insights\n\nOptimize plant operations with data-driven decisions\n\n**Try our** **[Solution Accelerator for OEE and KPI Monitoring](https://www.databricks.com/solutions/accelerators/overall-equipment-effectiveness)** **for**\n**performant and scalable end-to-end monitoring.**\n\n\n-----\n\nMarket dynamics and volatility are requiring manufacturers to bring products to\nmarket more quickly, optimize production processes and build agile supply chains\nat scale at a lower price.

Data science and machine learning (ML) are moving\n even faster. In the short time since we first published this eBook, businesses across industries have rapidly matured their machine learning operations (MLOps) ‚Äî implementing ML applications and moving their first models into production. This has turned ML models into corporate assets that need to be managed across the lifecycle.\n\n That‚Äôs why MLflow, an open-source platform developed by Databricks, has emerged\n as a leader in automating the end-to-end ML lifecycle. With 1.8 million 1 downloads a month ‚Äî and growing support in the developer community ‚Äî this open-source platform is simplifying the complex process of standardizing and productionizing MLOps. This updated eBook explores the advantages of MLflow and introduces you to the newest component: MLflow Model Registry. You‚Äôll also discover how MLflow fits into the Databricks Unified Data Analytics Platform for data engineering, science and analytics.\n\n\n-----\n\n**M A C H I N E L E A R N I N G L I F E C Y C L E**\n\n\nCHAPTER 1: **\u0007** **Machine Learning**\n\n#### Lifecycle Challenges\n\n\nBuilding machine learning models is hard. Putting them into production is harder. Enabling others ‚Äî data\n\nscientists, engineers or even yourself ‚Äî to reproduce your pipeline and results is equally challenging. How\n\nmany times have you or your peers had to discard previous work because it was either not documented\n\nproperly or too difficult to replicate?\n\nGetting models up to speed in the first place is significant enough that it can be easy to overlook long-\n\nterm management. What does this involve in practice? In essence, we have to compare the results of\n\ndifferent versions of ML models along with corresponding artifacts ‚Äî code, dependencies, visualizations,\n\nintermediate data and more ‚Äî to track what‚Äôs running where, and to redeploy and roll back updated models\n\nas needed. Each of these requires its own specific tools, and it‚Äôs these changes that make the ML lifecycle\n\nso challenging compared with traditional software development lifecycle (SDLC) management.\n\nThis represents a serious shift and creates challenges compared with a more traditional software\n\ndevelopment lifecycle for the following reasons:\n\n\nThe diversity and number of ML\n\ntools involved, coupled with a\n\nlack of standardization across\n\nML libraries and frameworks\n\n\nThe continuous nature of ML\n\ndevelopment, accompanied by a\n\nlack of tracking and management\n\ntools for machine learning models\n\nand experiments\n\n\nThe complexity of productionizing\n\nML models due to the lack of\n\nintegration among data pipelines,\n\nML environments and production\n\nservices\n\n\nLet‚Äôs look at each of these areas in turn.\n\n\n-----\n\n**M A C H I N E L E A R N I N G L I F E C Y C L E**\n\n###### The diversity and number of ML tools involved\n\n\nWhile the traditional software development process leads to the\n\nrationalization and governance of tools and platforms used for developing and\n\nmanaging applications, the ML lifecycle relies on data scientists‚Äô ability to use\n\nmultiple tools, whether for preparing data and training models, or deploying\n\nthem for production use. Data scientists will seek the latest algorithms from\n\n\nHowever, due to the variety of available tools and the lack of detailed tracking,\n\nteams often have trouble getting the same code to work again in the same way.\n\nReproducing the ML workflow is a critical challenge, whether a data scientist\n\nneeds to pass training code to an engineer for use in production or go back to\n\npast work to debug a problem.\n\n\nthe most up-to-date ML libraries and frameworks available to compare results\n\nand improve performance.\n\n**PREP DATA** **BUILD MODEL** **DEPLOY MODEL**\n\nAzure ML\n\n\n-----\n\n**M A C H I N E L E A R N I N G L I F E C Y C L E**\n\n###### The continuous nature of ML development\n\nTechnology never stands still. New data, algorithms,\n\nlibraries and frameworks impact model performance\n\ncontinuously and, thus, need to be tested. Therefore,\n\nmachine learning development requires a continuous\n\n\napproach, along with tracking capabilities to\n\ncompare and reproduce results. The performance\n\nof ML models depends not only on the algorithms\n\nused, but also on the quality of the data sets and the\n\nparameter values for the models.\n\n\n**P R E P**\n**D ATA**\n\n**B U I L D**\n**M O D E L**\n\n\nWhether practitioners work alone or on teams, it‚Äôs\n\nstill very difficult to track which parameters, code\n\nand data went into each experiment to produce a\n\nmodel, due to the intricate nature of the ML\n\nlifecycle itself.\n\n**D E P L O Y**\n**M O D E L**\n\n\n-----\n\n**M A C H I N E L E A R N I N G L I F E C Y C L E**\n\n###### The complexity of productionizing ML models\n\n\nIn software development, the architecture is set early on, based on the target\n\napplication. Once the infrastructure and architecture have been chosen, they\n\nwon‚Äôt be updated or changed due to the sheer amount of work involved in\n\nrebuilding applications from scratch. Modern developments, such as the move\n\nto microservices, are making this easier, but for the most part, SDLC focuses on\n\nmaintaining and improving what already exists.\n\n\nOne of today‚Äôs key challenges is to effectively transition models from\n\nexperimentation to staging and production ‚Äî without needing to rewrite the code\n\nfor production use. This is time-consuming and risky as it can introduce new\n\nbugs. There are many solutions available to productionize a model quickly, but\n\npractitioners need the ability to choose and deploy models across any platform,\n\nand scale resources as needed to manage model inference effectively on big data,\n\nin batch or real time.\n\n\nWith machine learning the first goal is to build a model. And keep in mind: a\n\nmodel‚Äôs performance in terms of accuracy and sensitivity is agnostic from the\n\ndeployment mode. However, models can be heavily dependent on latency, and\n\nthe chosen architecture requires significant scalability based on the business\n\napplication. End-to-end ML pipeline designs can be great for batch analytics and\n\nlooking at streaming data, but they can involve different approaches for real-time\n\nscoring when an application is based on a microservice architecture working via\n\nREST APIs, etc.\n\n\n-----\n\n**M A C H I N E L E A R N I N G L I F E C Y C L E**\n\n\nCHAPTER 2: **\u0007** **Applying Good Engineering**\n\n#### Principles to Machine Learning\n\n\nMany data science and machine learning projects fail due to preventable issues that have been resolved\n\nin software engineering for more than a decade. However, those solutions need to be adapted due to key\n\ndifferences between developing code and training ML models.\n\n-  \u0007 **Expertise, code and data** ‚Äî With the addition of data, data science and ML, code not only needs to deal\n\nwith data dependencies but also handle the inherent nondeterministic characteristics of statistical\n\nmodeling. ML models are not guaranteed to behave the same way when trained twice, unlike traditional\n\ncode, which can be easily unit tested.\n\n-  \u0007 **Model artifacts** ‚Äî In addition to application code, ML products and features also depend on models\n\nthat are the result of a training process. Those model artifacts can often be large ‚Äî on the order of\n\ngigabytes ‚Äî and often need to be served differently from code itself.\n\n-  \u0007 **Collaboration** ‚Äî In large organizations, models that are deployed in an application are usually not trained\n\nby the same people responsible for the deployment. Handoffs between experimentation, testing and\n\nproduction deployments are similar but not identical to approval processes in software engineering.\n\n\n-----\n\n**M A C H I N E L E A R N I N G L I F E C Y C L E**\n\n###### The need for standardization\n\nSome of the world‚Äôs largest tech companies have already begun solving these problems internally with\n\ntheir own machine learning platforms and lifecycle management tools. 2 These internal platforms have\n\nbeen extremely successful and are designed to accelerate the ML lifecycle by standardizing the process of\n\ndata preparation, model training, and deployment via APIs built for data scientists. The platforms not only\n\nhelp standardize the ML lifecycle but also play a major role in retaining knowledge and best practices, and\n\nmaximizing data science team productivity and collaboration, thereby leading to greater ROI.\n\nInternally driven strategies still have limitations. First, they are limited to a few algorithms or frameworks.\n\nAdoption of new tools or libraries can lead to significant bottlenecks. Of course, data scientists always\n\nwant to try the latest and the best algorithms, libraries and frameworks ‚Äî the most recent versions of\n\nPyTorch, TensorFlow and so on. Unfortunately, production teams cannot easily incorporate these into\n\nthe custom ML platform without significant rework. The second limitation is that each platform is tied\n\nto a specific company‚Äôs infrastructure. This can limit sharing of efforts among data scientists. As each\n\nframework is so specific, options for deployment can be limited.\n\nThe question then is: Can similar benefits to these systems be provided in an open manner? This evaluation\n\nmust be based on the widest possible mix of tools, languages, libraries and infrastructures. Without this\n\napproach, it will be very difficult for data scientists to evolve their ML models and keep pace with industry\n\ndevelopments. Moreover, by making it available as open source, the wider industry will be able to join in and\n\ncontribute to ML‚Äôs wider adoption. This also makes it easier to move between various tools and libraries\n\nover time.\n\n\n-----\n\n**M A C H I N E L E A R N I N G L I F E C Y C L E**\n\n\nCHAPTER 3: **\u0007** **Introducing MLflow**\n\n**M AT E I Z A H A R I A**\n\nCo-founder and Chief Technologist at Databricks\n\n\nAt Databricks, we believe that there should be a better way to manage the ML lifecycle. So in June 2018,\n\nwe unveiled [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) , an open-source machine learning platform for managing the complete ML lifecycle.\n\n###### ‚ÄúMLflow is designed to be a cross-cloud, modular, API-first framework, to work well with\n all popular ML frameworks and libraries. It is open and extensible by design, and platform\n agnostic for maximum flexibility.‚Äù\n\nWith MLflow, data scientists can now package code as reproducible runs, execute and\n\ncompare hundreds of parallel experiments, and leverage any hardware or software platform\n\nfor training, hyperparameter tuning and more. Also, organizations can deploy and manage\n\nmodels in production on a variety of clouds and serving platforms.\n\n###### ‚Äú With MLflow, data science teams can systematically package and reuse models\n across frameworks, track and share experiments locally or in the cloud, and deploy\n models virtually anywhere,‚Äù says Zaharia. ‚ÄúThe flurry of interest and contributions we‚Äôve\n seen from the data science community validates the need for an open-source framework to\n streamline the machine learning lifecycle.‚Äù\n\n\n-----\n\n**M A C H I N E L E A R N I N G L I F E C Y C L E**\n\n###### Key benefits\n\n**EXPERIMENT TRACKING** As mentioned previously, getting ML models to perform takes significant trial and error, and continuous configuration, building, tuning, testing,\n\netc. Therefore, it is imperative to allow data science teams to track all that goes into a specific run, along with the results. With MLflow, data scientists can quickly record\n\nruns and keep track of model parameters, results, code and data from each experiment, all in one place.\n\n\n-----\n\n**M A C H I N E L E A R N I N G L I F E C Y C L E**\n\n###### Key benefits\n\n\n**FLEXIBLE DEPLOYMENT** There is virtually no limit to what machine learning can\n\ndo for your business. However, there are different ways to architect ML applications\n\nfor production, and various tools can be used for deploying models, which often\n\nlead to code rewrites prior to deploying ML models into production. With MLflow,\n\nyour data scientists can quickly download or deploy any saved models to various\n\nplatforms ‚Äî locally or in the cloud ‚Äî from experimentation to production.\n\n\n**REPRODUCIBLE PROJECTS** The ability to reproduce a project ‚Äî entirely or just\n\nparts of it ‚Äî is key to data science productivity, knowledge sharing and, hence,\n\naccelerating innovation. With MLflow, data scientists can build and package\n\ncomposable projects, capture dependencies and code history for reproducible\n\nresults, and quickly share projects with their peers.\n\n\n-----\n\n**M A C H I N E L E A R N I N G L I F E C Y C L E**\n\n###### Key benefits\n\n**MODEL MANAGEMENT** Use one central place to share ML models, collaborate on moving them from experimentation to online testing and production, integrate with\n\napproval and governance workflows, and monitor ML deployments and their performance. This is powered by the latest MLflow component, MLflow Model Registry.\n\n**M O D E L D E P L O Y M E N T A N D M O N I T O R I N G**\n\n**I N - L I N E C O D E**\n\nÔøΩÔøΩ\n\n**M L L I B R A R I E S**\n\n###### Model Format\n\n**C O N TA I N E R S**\n\n\n**F L AV O R 1**\n\n\n**F L AV O R 2**\n\n**B AT C H A N D S T R E A M S C O R I N G**\n\n\nSimple model flavors\nusable by many tools\n\n\n**C L O U D I N F E R E N C E S E R V I C E S**\n\n\n-----\n\n**M A C H I N E L E A R N I N G L I F E C Y C L E**\n\n###### Use case examples\n\nLet‚Äòs examine three use cases to explore how users can leverage some of the MLflow components.\n\n\n**EXPERIMENT TRACKING** A European energy\n\ncompany is using MLflow to track and update\n\nhundreds of energy-grid models. This company‚Äôs\n\ngoal is to build a time-series model for every major\n\nenergy producer (e.g., power plant) and consumer\n\n(e.g., factory), monitor these models using standard\n\nmetrics, and combine the predictions to drive\n\nbusiness processes, such as pricing. Because a\n\nsingle team is responsible for hundreds of models,\n\npossibly using different ML libraries, it‚Äôs important to\n\nhave a standard development and tracking process.\n\nThe team has standardized on Jupyter notebooks\n\nfor development, MLflow Tracking for metrics, and\n\nDatabricks Jobs for inference.\n\n\n**REPRODUCIBLE PROJECTS** An online marketplace\n\nis using MLflow to package deep learning jobs using\n\nKeras and run them in the cloud. Each data scientist\n\ndevelops models locally on a laptop using a small\n\ndata set, checks them into a Git repository with\n\nan MLproject file, and submits remote runs of the\n\nproject to GPU instances in the cloud for large-scale\n\ntraining or hyperparameter search. Using MLflow\n\nProjects makes it easy to create the same software\n\nenvironment in the cloud and share project code\n\namong data scientists.\n\n\n**MODEL PACKAGING** An e-commerce site‚Äôs data\n\nscience team is using MLflow Model Registry to\n\npackage recommendation models for use by\n\napplication engineers. This presents a technical\n\nchallenge because the recommendation\n\napplication includes both a standard, off-the-shelf\n\nrecommendation model and custom business logic\n\nfor pre- and post-processing. For example, the\n\napplication might include custom code to ensure the\n\nrecommended items are diverse. This business logic\n\nneeds to change in sync with the model, and the data\n\nscience team wants to control both the business logic\n\nand the model, without having to submit a patch to\n\nthe web application each time the logic has to change.\n\nMoreover, the team wants to A/B test distinct models\n\nwith distinct versions of the processing logic. The\n\nsolution was to package both the recommendation\n\nmodel and the custom logic using the python_\n\nfunction flavor in an MLflow Model, which can then\n\nbe deployed and tested as a single unit.\n\n\n-----\n\n**M A C H I N E L E A R N I N G L I F E C Y C L E**\n\n###### Open and extensible by design\n\nSince we [unveiled](https://databricks.com/blog/2018/06/05/introducing-mlflow-an-open-source-machine-learning-platform.html) and open sourced MLflow in June 2018 at the Spark + AI Summit in San Francisco, community engagement and contributions have led to an impressive\n\narray of new features and integrations:\n\n\n**SUPPORT FOR MULTIPLE**\n\n**PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES**\n\nTo give developers a choice, MLflow supports R,\n\nPython, Java and Scala, along with a REST server\n\ninterface that can be used from any language.\n\n\n**INTEGRATION WITH POPULAR ML**\n\n**LIBRARIES AND FRAMEWORKS**\n\nMLflow has built-in integrations with the most popular\n\nmachine learning libraries ‚Äî such as scikit-learn,\n\nTensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, H2O, and Apache Spark‚Ñ¢\n\nMLlib ‚Äî to help teams build, test and deploy machine\n\nlearning applications.\n\n\n**CROSS-CLOUD SUPPORT**\n\nOrganizations can use MLflow to quickly deploy\n\nmachine learning models to multiple cloud services,\n\nincluding Databricks, Azure Machine Learning and\n\nAmazon SageMaker, depending on their needs.\n\nMLflow leverages AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage and\n\nAzure Data Lake Storage, allowing teams to easily\n\ntrack and share artifacts from their code.\n\n\n-----\n\n**M A C H I N E L E A R N I N G L I F E C Y C L E**\n\n###### Rapid community adoption\n\n## 2.5M\n#### monthly downloads\n\n## 200+\n#### code contributors\n\n\n## 100+\n#### contributing organizations\n\n\nOrganizations using and contributing to MLflow\n\nSource: [mlflow.org](https://mlflow.org)\n\n\n-----\n\n**M A C H I N E L E A R N I N G L I F E C Y C L E**\n\n\nCHAPTER 4: **\u0007** **A Closer Look at**\n\n#### MLflow Model Registry\n\n\nMLflow originally introduced the ability to [track metrics, parameters and artifacts](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#) as part of experiments,\n\n[package models and reproducible ML projects](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/projects.html) , and [deploy models to batch or to real-time serving platforms](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html) .\n\nThe latest MLflow component ‚Äî MLflow Model Registry ‚Äî builds on MLflow‚Äôs original capabilities to\n\nprovide organizations with one central place to share ML models, collaborate on moving them from\n\nexperimentation to testing and production, and implement approval and governance workflows.\n\nÔøΩÔøΩ\n\n\n**Model Registry**\n\n\n**D O W N S T R E A M**\n\n\nÔøΩÔøΩ\n\n**Tracking Server**\n\n\nData Scientists\n\n**Staging**\n\n\nData Engineers\n\n**Production** **Archived**\n\n**A U T O M AT E D J O B S**\n\n\n**Parameters**\n\n\n**Metrics** **Artifacts**\n\n\nThe Model Registry gives MLflow users new\n\n\ntools for sharing, reviewing and managing\n\nML models throughout their lifecycle\n\n\n**Metadata** **Models**\n\n**R E S T S E R V I N G**\n\n**R E V I E W E R S + C I / C D T O O L S**\n\nThe MLflow Model Registry complements the MLflow offering and is designed to help organizations\n\nimplement good engineering principles with machine learning initiatives, such as collaboration,\n\ngovernance, reproducibility and knowledge management.

Not only are the responsibilities\n\nalong the machine learning model lifecycle often split across multiple people\n\n(e.g., data scientists train models whereas production engineers deploy them),\n\nbut also at each lifecycle stage, teams can benefit from collaboration and sharing\n\n\n###### Flexible CI/CD pipelines to manage stage transitions\n\nMLflow lets you manage your models‚Äô lifecycles either manually or through\n\nautomated tools. Analogous to the approval process in software engineering,\n\nusers can manually request to move a model to a new lifecycle stage (e.g., from\n\nstaging to production), and review or comment on other users‚Äô transition requests.\n\n\n(e.g., a fraud model built in one part of the organization could be reused in others).\n\nAlternatively, you can use the Model Registry‚Äôs API to plug in continuous integration\n\n\nMLflow facilitates sharing of expertise and knowledge across teams by making ML\n\nmodels more discoverable and providing collaborative features to jointly improve\n\non common ML tasks. Simply register an MLflow model from your experiments to\n\n\nand deployment (CI/CD) tools, such as Jenkins, to automatically test and transition\n\nyour models. Each model also links to the experiment run that built it ‚Äî in MLflow\n\nTracking ‚Äî to let you easily review models.\n\n\nget started.

Legacy on-premises data warehouse architectures\n\nare difficult to scale and make it difficult for data teams to keep up\n\nwith the exponential growth of data. Oftentimes data teams publish\n\nand use a subset of well-defined data for development and testing.\n\nThis slows down both innovation and time to insight.\n\nCloud data warehouses (CDW) were an attempt to tackle the\n\non-premises data warehouse challenges. CDWs removed the\n\nadministrative burden of tasks such as setup, upgrades and\n\nbackups. CDWs also improved scalability and introduced cloud‚Äôs\n\npay-as-you-go model to reduce cost. CDWs leverage a proprietary\n\ndata format to achieve cloud-scale and performance; however, this\n\nalso leads to customers locked into these formats with difficult\n\n\nBut enterprise data teams don‚Äôt need a better data warehouse.\n\nThey need an innovative, simple solution that provides reliable\n\nperformance, elastic scale and allows self-service to unblock\n\nanalytics to access all data at a reasonable cost. The answer is\n\nthe lakehouse.\n\nThe lakehouse pattern represents a paradigm shift from traditional\n\non-premises data warehouse systems that are expensive and\n\ncomplex to manage. It uses an open data management architecture\n\nthat combines the flexibility, cost-efficiency and scale of data\n\nlakes with the data management and ACID semantics of data\n\nwarehouses. A lakehouse pattern enables data transformation,\n\ncleansing and validation to support both business intelligence and\n\nmachine learning (ML) users on all data. Lakehouse is cloud-centric\n\nand unifies a complete up-to-date data set for teams, allowing\n\ncollaboration across an organization.\n\n\npaths to support use cases outside the data warehouse itself\n\n(i.e., machine learning). Customers often find themselves with a\n\nbifurcated architecture, which ultimately leads to a more costly and\n\ncomplex data platform over time.\n\n\n-----\n\n## The Databricks Lakehouse Platform\n\nThe Databricks Lakehouse Platform is **simple** ; it unifies your data, governance, analytics\n\nand AI on one platform. It‚Äôs **open** ‚Äî the open source format Delta Lake unifies your data\n\necosystem with open standards and data formats. Databricks is **multicloud** ‚Äî delivering\n\none **consistent experience across all clouds** so you don‚Äôt need to reinvent the wheel for\n\nevery cloud platform that you‚Äôre using to support your data and AI efforts.\n\nDatabricks SQL stores and processes data using Delta Lake to simplify and enhance\n\ndata warehousing capabilities. Analysts can use their favorite language, SQL, popular\n\ntransformation tools such as dbt, and preferred BI tools like Power BI and Tableau to\n\nanalyze data. The built-in query editor reduces contextual switching and improves\n\nproductivity. Administrators enjoy simplified workload management via serverless\n\ncompute and auto-scaling to meet high-concurrency workload needs. All this at a\n\nfraction of the cost of traditional data warehouses.\n\n\n###### Lakehouse Platform\n\n\nData\nWarehousing\n\n\nData\nEngineering\n\n\nData\nStreaming\n\n\nData SÔøΩienÔøΩÔøΩ\nand ML\n\n\nUnity Catalog\nFine-grained governance for data and AI\n\nDelta Lake\nData relia)ility and .erfor2ance\n\nCloud Data Lake\nAll structured and unstructured data\n\nSimple Open Multicloud\n\n\n-----\n\n## Business Value\n\n#### Single source of truth\n\nDatabricks Delta Lake leverages cloud-based blob storage to provide an infinitely\n\nscalable storage layer where you can store all your data, including raw and historical data,\n\nalongside structured data tables in the data warehouse. The lakehouse pattern avoids\n\ndata silos and shares the same elastic scale and governance across all use cases: BI, data\n\nengineering, streaming and AI/ML. This means that data engineering teams don‚Äôt have to\n\nmove data to a proprietary data warehouse for business analysts or create a separate\n\ndata store to support data science.\n\nInstead, data teams can access the open format Delta tables directly and combine data\n\nsets in the lakehouse, as needed. Data scientists can also work collaboratively on common\n\ndata with access to versioned history to facilitate repeatable experiments. A single source\n\nof truth facilitates moving from descriptive to predictive analytics.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Data team\n\n\nWith central data governance and fine-grained access control\n\ncapabilities to secure the lakehouse, you can enable self-service\n\nSQL analytics for everyone on the Databricks Lakehouse Platform.\n\nThis allows each team to be more agile and innovate faster.\n\n**Data Analysts** ‚Äî Using the Databricks SQL editor\n\nor their tools of choice (DBT, Power BI, Tableau), SQL\n\nanalysts can leverage familiar toolsets.\n\n**Data Engineers** ‚Äî Utilizing Delta Lake as a unified\n\nstorage layer, data engineering teams can eliminate\n\nduplicate data and ETL jobs that move data across\n\nvarious systems. Databricks supports both batch and\n\nstreaming workloads to reduce bottlenecks and serve\n\nthe most up-to-date data to downstream users and\n\napplications.\n\n**Administrators** ‚Äî The pay-as-you-go, decentralized\n\ncompute resource allows each team to run their\n\n\nThe Databricks Lakehouse Platform provides a reliable ETL and data\n\nmanagement framework to simplify ETL pipelines. Data teams can\n\nbuild end-to-end data transformations in a single pipeline instead of\n\nmany small ETL tasks. Databricks supports data quality enforcement\n\nto ensure reliability with auto-scalable infrastructure. Your teams\n\ncan onboard new data sources quickly to power new use cases with\n\nfresh data. This not only allows your team to efficiently and reliably\n\ndeliver high-quality data in a timely manner, it also reduces ETL\n\nworkload cost significantly.\n\n#### Future-proof\n\nUnlike CDWs that lock customers in, Databricks offers an open\n\nplatform with open standards, open protocols and open data\n\nformats. It supports a full range of popular languages (SQL, Python,\n\nR, Scala) and popular BI tools. You can leverage the performant\n\nand low-cost distributed compute layer for data processing ‚Äî or\n\nuse a variety of tools and engines to efficiently access the data via\n\nDatabricks APIs. Databricks also allows data consumption with a rich\n\npartner ecosystem. Teams can handle all existing BI and AI use cases\n\nwith the flexibility to support future use cases as they emerge.\n\n\nworkload in isolated environments without worrying\n\nabout contention. Serverless SQL endpoint frees your\n\nteam from infrastructure management challenges.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Migration to Lakehouse\n\n#### Overview\n\nA lakehouse is the ideal data architecture for data-driven organizations. It combines the\n\nbest qualities of data warehouses and data lakes to provide a single solution for all major\n\ndata workloads and supports use cases from streaming analytics to BI, data science and\n\nAI. The Databricks Lakehouse Platform leverages low-cost, durable cloud storage and\n\nonly consumes (charges for) compute resources when workloads are running. This pay-\n\n\n**C U S T O M E R S T O R Y**\n##### Building the Lakehouse\n at Atlassian\n\n[Watch now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo1U617T-mU)\n\n\nas-you-go model means compute resources are automatically shut down if no processing\n\nis needed. Data teams can use small clusters that can power individual workloads\n\nthey plan to migrate. They can make the choice to leverage serverless SQL endpoints\n\nand completely free data teams from infrastructure capacity planning and cluster\n\nmaintenance. The auto-scaling, elastic nature of Databricks clusters leads to significant\n\nsavings on infrastructure cost and maintenance. Organizations typically achieve 50% TCO\n\nsavings compared to other cloud data warehouses.\n\nData warehouse migration is never an easy task. Databricks aims to mitigate the things\n\nthat can go wrong in these demanding migration projects. The Databricks Lakehouse\n\nPlatform provides many out-of-the-box features to mitigate migration risks.\n\n**C U S T O M E R S T O R Y**\n##### Driving Freight Transportation Into the Future\n\n[Read more](https://databricks.com/customers/jbhunt)\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Migration strategy\n\n\nMigration is a huge effort and very expensive. Yet, almost every\n\nenterprise has to migrate to new platforms every 3‚Äì5 years because\n\nthe old platform cannot support new use cases, catch up with\n\ndata growth or meet scaling needs. To get better ROI on migration,\n\nimplement a migration strategy that can reduce future re-platform\n\nneeds and extend to your future data and AI strategy.\n\nUse the opportunity of a data migration to standardize your data\n\nin open Delta format to allow existing and future tools to access\n\nit directly without moving or converting it. Merge your siloed\n\ndata warehouses into the unified storage layer in the Databricks\n\nLakehouse Platform ‚Äî without worrying about storage capacity.\n\nThe unified storage layer allows your team to deploy a unified data\n\ngovernance on top to secure all data access consistently. Simplify\n\nyour data governance story with Databricks Unity Catalog.\n\n\nMove toward a single, consistent approach to data pipelining\n\nand refinement. Merge batch and streaming into a single end-\n\nto-end pipeline to get fresher data and provide more real-time\n\ndecisions. Take a metadata-driven approach to align the dataflow\n\nwith business processes and have data validation and quality\n\ncheck built-in. Through a series of curation and refinement steps,\n\nthe output results in highly consumable and trusted data for\n\ndownstream use cases.\n\nThe lakehouse architecture makes it possible for the organization\n\nto create ‚Äúdata assets‚Äù by taking a stepwise approach to improving\n\ndata and serving all essential use cases. Encourage your BI/analyst\n\nteam to leverage Databricks serverless endpoints for self-serve\n\nand agility. Each team can evaluate their top priority workloads and\n\nmigrate them in parallel to speed up migration.\n\nTake advantage of Databricks‚Äô rich partner ecosystem. Your favorite\n\npartners are likely already integrated via Partner Connect and\n\ncan be set up with a few clicks. There are also many ISV and SI\n\nconsulting partners who can help your migration journey.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Migration planning\n\nMigrating a data warehouse to the cloud can be time consuming and challenging for your\n\ndata teams. It‚Äôs important to agree on the data architecture, migration strategy and process/\n\nframeworks to be used before undertaking a data migration. Databricks provides Migration\n\nAssessment and Architecture Review sessions to develop a joint migration roadmap. This\n\nprocess is designed to help organizations to successfully migrate to a lakehouse architecture.\n\nBased on information collected and business objectives, the Databricks team will work with\n\ncustomers to propose a target architecture and provide a tailored migration roadmap.\n\nThese assessments help get a full picture of current data systems and the future vision. They\n\nclarify what you are migrating and do proper use case discovery. This includes identifying\n\nworkloads and data source dependency, for example:\n\nSample migration assessment checklist:\n\nIdentify upstream data sources and workload dependencies\n\nIdentify active/inactive data sets and database objects\n\nIdentify downstream application dependencies and data freshness requirements\n\nDefine a cost-tracking mechanism, such as tag rules for chargeback and cost attribution\n\nDefine security requirements and data governance\n\nClarify access management need, document needed permissions per user/group\n\nOutline current tooling (ingestion, ETL and BI) and what‚Äôs needed\n\n\n-----\n\nIt‚Äôs important to identify key stakeholders and keep them engaged during the migration to\n\nmake sure they are aligned with the overall objectives. The workload assessment result will\n\nbe reviewed with key stakeholders. Through the review process, data teams can get a better\n\nunderstanding of which workloads can most benefit from modernization.\n\nDatabricks often works with partners to provide a workload assessment and help customers\n\nunderstand their migration complexity and properly plan a budget. Databricks also partners\n\nwith third-party vendors that provide migration tools to securely automate major migration\n\ntasks. Databricks Partner Connect makes it easy to connect with this ecosystem of tools to\n\nhelp with the migration, including:\n\n\u0007Code conversion tooling that can automatically translate 70%‚Äì95% of the SQL code in\n\nyour current system to Databricks optimized code with Delta and other best practices\n\n\u0007Converters that automate multiple GUI-based ETL/ELT platform conversion to reduce\n\nmigration time and cost\n\n\u0007Data migration tools that can migrate data from on-premises storage to cloud storage\n\n2x‚Äì3x faster than what was previously possible\n\n\n-----\n\n#### We can use Automated conversion for most workload types\n\n###### EDWs\n\n\nOpen Cloud Storage\nADLS, S3, GCP Storage\n\nDatabricks Tables, ÔøΩieÔøΩs\n\nSpark SQL Databricks Notebooks\n\nSpark SQL ÔøΩ little bit oÔøΩ Python or ScalÔøΩ\n\nRuns on Databricks JDBC/ODBC\n\nDatabricks permissions- Table ACLs\n\nCredential Pass-throughs to Files\n\nBig Data ETL tools, Databricks Notebooks\n\nAir5oÔøΩ DAGs, ADF, Databricks Job\nand any other Enterprise Schedulers\n\n\nData Migration\n\nMetastore Migration\n\nSQL Migration\n\nSecurity\n\nETL Tools\n\n\nDB locked ÔøΩormats on Disks\n\nDatabases, Tables, ÔøΩieÔøΩs\n\nAd-hoc SQL ÔøΩueries\n\nT-SQL, PL/SQL, BTEQ\n\nReports ÔøΩrom PB`, Tableau etc^\n\nGRANTs, Roles\n\nExternal tables- File permissions\n\nData Stage, PoÔøΩerCenter, Ab `nitio etc^\n\n\nOrchestration ETL Schedulers\n\n\n-----\n\n#### ELT approach\n\nThe separation of storage and compute makes ELT on lakehouse a better choice than traditional\n\nETL. You can ingest all raw data to Delta Lake, leverage low-cost storage and create a Medallion\n\ndata implementation from raw/Bronze to curated/Gold depending on what‚Äôs needed to support\n\nuse cases. During ingestion, basic data validation can occur, but establishing a Bronze data layer is\n\nthe foundation of a single-pane-of-glass for the business. Teams can leverage compute resources\n\nas needed without a fixed compute infrastructure. Establishing a Silver layer further enriches data\n\nby exploring and applying transformations. ELT allows data teams to break pipelines into smaller\n\n‚Äúmigrations,‚Äù starting with a simple workload, then improving the pipeline design iteratively.\n\n**I M P R O V E D ATA Q U A L I T Y**\n\nData B r o n z e Ta b l e s S i lv e r Ta b l e s G o l d Ta b l e s\n\nStreaming Analytics\n\nCSV TXT JSON\n\n\nD ata ÔøΩa ÔøΩe\n\n\nRaw\nintegration\n\n\nFiltered, Cleaned,\nAugmented\n\n\nBusiness-level\nAggregates\n\n\nReuorting\n\n\n-----\n\nWe highly recommend leveraging [Delta Live Tables (DLT)](https://databricks.com/product/delta-live-tables) , a new cloud-native managed\n\nservice in the Databricks Lakehouse Platform that provides a reliable ETL framework to\n\nmodernize your data pipeline at scale. Instead of migrating multiple ETL tasks one by one in\n\na traditional data warehouse, you can focus on source and expected output, and create your\n\nentire dataflow graph declaratively. Delta Live Tables offers:\n\n\u0007A metadata-driven approach ‚Äî You just specify what data should be in each table or view\n\nrather than the details of how processing should be done\n\n\u0007An end-to-end data pipeline with data quality and freshness checks, end-to-end\n\nmonitoring/visibility, error recovery, and lineage, which reduces the strain on data\n\nengineering teams and improves time-to-value in building data pipelines\n\n\u0007Automatic management of all the dependencies within the pipeline. This ensures all tables\n\nare populated correctly, whether continuously or on a regular schedule. For example,\n\nupdating one table will automatically trigger all downstream table updates to keep data\n\nup-to-date.\n\n\u0007All pipelines are built code-first, which makes editing, debugging and testing of data\n\npipelines simpler and easier. DLT can also automatically recover from common error\n\nconditions, reducing operational overhead.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Agile modernization\n\n\nAgile development allows teams to move quickly knowing migrated\n\npipelines can be revisited at a later cycle and evolving data models\n\nare supported within the architecture. Allowing business impact to\n\ndrive priorities via an agile approach helps mitigate migration risks.\n\nPrioritizing and selecting use cases where modernization brings\n\nbusiness benefits quickly is a good starting point. Focus on the 20%\n\nof workloads that consume 80% of budget. By breaking workflows\n\ndown into components and managing data stories, teams can adjust\n\npriorities over time. Changes can be made in collaboration with the\n\nuser community to fit the business definition of value.\n\nMigrating to a lakehouse architecture leverages separation of storage\n\nand compute to remove resource contention between ETL and BI\n\nworkloads. As a result, the migration process can be more agile,\n\nallowing you to evolve your design iteratively without big-bang effort:\n\n\u0007Reduce time during the initial phase on full capacity plan and\n\n\nAll of this allows you to take a more iterative and business-focused\n\napproach for migration instead of a full planning, execution, test/\n\nvalidation approach. Here are more approaches that help facilitate\n\nthis phased implementation:\n\n\u0007Leverage [Databricks Auto Loader](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/structured-streaming/auto-loader.html) . Auto Loader helps to ingest\n\nnew data into pipelines quicker to get data in near real-time.\n\n\u0007Delta Live Tables (DLT) improves data quality during data\n\ntransformation and automatically scales to address data volume\n\nchange. DLT can also support schema evolution and quarantine\n\nbad data or data that needs to be reprocessed at a later stage.\n\n\u0007Use dedicated clusters to isolate workloads, lower the total cost\n\nof ownership and improve overall performance. By using multiple\n\nclusters, we can shut down resources when not in use and move\n\naway from managing fixed resources in a single large cluster.\n\n\nscoping\n\n\u0007Flexible cloud infrastructure and unlimited, autoscaling storage\n\n\u0007Workload management is much simpler, you can isolate each\n\nworkload with a dedicated compute resource, without worrying\n\nabout managing workload contention\n\n\u0007Auto-scale and tear down the compute resources after the job\n\nis done to achieve cost efficiency\n\n\n-----\n\nLeverage Databricks‚Äô deep bench of expertise to build reusable assets along the migration:\n\n\u0007Create a migration factory for iterative migration process\n\n\u0007Determine and implement a security and governance framework\n\n\u0007Establish a to-be environment and move use cases/workloads in logical units\n\n\u0007Prove business value and scale over time\n\n\u0007Add new functionality continuously so important business requirements are not left on hold during migration\n\nTake this iterative and templated approach.

Leverage the migration\n\nprocess to simplify data warehousing tasks. Regardless of how you\n\ncomplete your migration, you could utilize lakehouse strengths to\n\nimprove architectural patterns:\n\n\u0007Merge your siloed data warehouses on your unified lakehouse\n\nplatform and unify data access and data governance via Unity\n\nCatalog. The lakehouse architecture provides a unified storage\n\nlayer for all your data where there is no physical boundary\n\nbetween data. There is no need to keep data copies for each\n\nsystem using the data set. Clean up and remove jobs that are\n\ncreated to keep data in sync across various data systems.\n\nKeep a single copy of raw data in your lakehouse as a single\n\nsource of truth.\n\n\u0007The Databricks Lakehouse Platform allows you to merge batch\n\nand streaming into a single system to build a simple continuous\n\n\n\u0007Simplify your workload isolation and management by running jobs\n\nin dedicated clusters. Separating storage and compute allows you\n\nto easily isolate each task with isolated compute resources. There\n\nis no need to squeeze them into a single large data appliance\n\nand spend lots of time managing and coordinating resources.\n\nLeverage the elasticity of the Databricks compute layer to\n\nautomatically handle workload concurrency changes at peak time\n\ninstead of paying for over-provisioned resources for most of the\n\ntime. This greatly simplifies the workload management effort the\n\ntraditional data warehouses require.\n\n\u0007Simplify disaster recovery. Storage and compute separation\n\nallows easy disaster recovery. The cloud storage provides very\n\ngood data redundancy and supports automated replication\n\nto another region. Customers can spin up compute resources\n\nquickly in another region and maintain service availability in case\n\nof an outage.\n\n\ndata flow model to process data as it arrives. Process data in\n\nnear real-time and enable data-driven decisions with the most\n\nrecent updates.\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Security and data governance\n\n\nSecurity is paramount in any data-driven organization. Data security\n\nshould enforce the business needs for both internal and external\n\ndata, so the lakehouse should be set up to meet your organization‚Äôs\n\nsecurity requirements. Databricks provides built-in security to\n\nprotect your data during and after migration.\n\n\u0007Encrypt data at rest and in-transit, using a cloud-managed key\n\nor your own\n\n\u0007Set up a custom network policy, use IP range to control access\n\n\u0007Leverage Private Link to limit network traffic to not traverse the\n\npublic internet\n\n\nThe challenge with the traditional data warehouse and data lake\n\narchitecture is that data is stored in multiple stores and your data\n\nteam also needs to manage data access and data governance\n\ntwice. The lakehouse pattern uses unified storage which simplifies\n\ngovernance. The Databricks Lakehouse Platform provides a unified\n\ngovernance layer across all your data teams. Migrating to Databricks\n\nUnity Catalog provides data discovery, data lineage, role-based\n\nsecurity policies, table or row/column-level access control, and\n\ncentral auditing capabilities that make the data platform easy for\n\ndata stewards to confidently manage and secure data access to\n\nmeet compliance and privacy needs, directly on the lakehouse.\n\n\n\u0007Enable SSO, integrate with active directory and other IdPs\n\n\u0007Control data access to database objects using RBAC\n\n\u0007Enable audit logs to monitor user activities\n\n\n-----\n\nA-ÔøΩit Log\n\nAcco-nt Level$\nUser Management\n\nCreÔøΩentials\n\n##### Centralized Governance\n\nACL Store\n\nAccess Control\n\n\nMetastore\n\nLineage Explorer\n\nData Explorer\n\n\n-----\n\n#### Team involvement\n\nPlan to educate and train your team iteratively throughout the\n\nmigration process.

Delta Lake runs on top of existing data lakes and is fully\n\ncompatible with Apache Spark‚Ñ¢ APIs.\n\nAt Databricks, we‚Äôve seen how Delta Lake can bring reliability, performance and\n\nlifecycle management to data lakes. Our customers have found that Delta Lake\n\nsolves for challenges around malformed data ingestion, difficulties deleting data for\n\ncompliance, or issues modifying data for data capture.\n\nWith Delta Lake, you can accelerate the velocity that high-quality data can get into\n\nyour data lake and the rate that teams can leverage that data with a secure and\n\nscalable cloud service.\n\n\n-----\n\n**What Is a Lakehouse?**\n### CHAPTER 01\n\n\n-----\n\n**What Is a**\n**Lakehouse?**\n# 01\n\nOver the past few years at Databricks, we‚Äôve seen a new data management architecture\n\nthat emerged independently across many customers and use cases: the **lakehouse.**\n\nIn this chapter, we‚Äôll describe this new architecture and its advantages over previous\n\napproaches.\n\nData warehouses have a long history of decision support and business intelligence\n\napplications. Since its inception in the late 1980s, data warehouse technology\n\ncontinued to evolve and MPP architectures led to systems that were able to handle\n\nlarger data sizes.\n\nBut while warehouses were great for structured data, a lot of modern enterprises\n\nhave to deal with unstructured data, semi-structured data, and data with high variety,\n\nvelocity and volume. Data warehouses are not suited for many of these use cases, and\n\nthey are certainly not the most cost-efficient.\n\nAs companies began to collect large amounts of data from many different sources,\n\narchitects began envisioning a single system to house data for many different\n\nanalytic products and workloads.\n\nAbout a decade ago, companies began building [data lakes](https://databricks.com/glossary/data-lake) -- repositories for raw data\n\nin a variety of formats. While suitable for storing data, data lakes lack some critical\n\nfeatures: They do not support transactions, they do not enforce data quality, and their\n\nlack of consistency / isolation makes it almost impossible to mix appends and reads,\n\n\n-----\n\n**A lakehouse combines the best elements**\n**of data lakes and data warehouses**\n\nA lakehouse is a new data architecture that combines the best elements of data lakes\n\nand data warehouses.\n\n\nand batch and streaming jobs. For these reasons, many of the promises of data lakes\n\nhave not materialized and, in many cases, lead to a loss of many of the benefits of data\n\nwarehouses.\n\n\nThe need for a flexible, high-performance system hasn‚Äôt abated. Companies\n\n\nrequire systems for diverse data applications including SQL analytics, real-time\n\nmonitoring, data science and machine learning. Most of the recent advances in\n\nAI have been in better models to process unstructured data (text, images, video,\n\naudio), but these are precisely the types of data that a data warehouse is not\n\noptimized for.\n\nA common approach is to use multiple systems ‚Äî a data lake, several data\n\nwarehouses, and other specialized systems such as streaming, time-series, graph\n\nand image databases. Having a multitude of systems introduces complexity and,\n\nmore importantly, introduces delay as data professionals invariably need to move\n\nor copy data between different systems.\n\n\nLakehouses are enabled by a new system design: implementing similar data struc-\n\ntures and data management features to those in a data warehouse, directly on the\n\nkind of low-cost storage used for data lakes. They are what you would get if you had\n\nto redesign data warehouses in the modern world, now that cheap and highly reliable\n\nstorage (in the form of object stores) are available.\n\nA lakehouse has the following key features:\n\n-  **\u0007Transaction support:** In an enterprise lakehouse, many data pipelines will often\n\nbe reading and writing data concurrently. Support for ACID transactions ensures\n\nconsistency as multiple parties concurrently read or write data, typically using\n\nSQL.\n\n\n-----\n\n-  **\u0007Schema enforcement and governance:** The lakehouse should have a way to\n\nsupport schema enforcement and evolution, supporting DW schema paradigms\n\nsuch as star/snowflake-schemas. The system should be able to reason about data\n\nintegrity, and it should have robust governance and auditing mechanisms.\n\n-  **\u0007BI support:** Lakehouses enable using BI tools directly on the source data. This\n\nreduces staleness and improves recency, reduces latency and lowers the cost of\n\nhaving to operationalize two copies of the data in both a data lake and a warehouse.\n\n-  **\u0007Storage is decoupled from compute:** In practice, this means storage and\n\ncompute use separate clusters, thus these systems are able to scale to many more\n\nconcurrent users and larger data sizes. Some modern data warehouses also have\n\nthis property.\n\n-  **\u0007Openness:** The storage formats they use are open and standardized, such as\n\nParquet, and they provide an API so a variety of tools and engines, including\n\nmachine learning and Python/R libraries, can efficiently access the data directly.\n\n-  **\u0007Support for diverse data types ranging from unstructured to structured data:**\n\nThe lakehouse can be used to store, refine, analyze and access data types needed\n\nfor many new data applications, including images, video, audio, semi-structured\n\ndata, and text.\n\n-  **\u0007Support for diverse workloads:** Including data science, machine learning and SQL\n\nanalytics. Multiple tools might be needed to support all these workloads, but they all\n\nrely on the same data repository.\n\n-  **\u0007End-to-end streaming:** Real-time reports are the norm in many enterprises.\n\nSupport for streaming eliminates the need for separate systems dedicated to\n\nserving real-time data applications.\n\nThese are the key attributes of lakehouses. Enterprise-grade systems require additional\n\nfeatures. Tools for security and access control are basic requirements. Data governance\n\ncapabilities including auditing, retention and lineage have become essential particularly\n\nin light of recent privacy regulations. Tools that enable data discovery such as data\n\ncatalogs and data usage metrics are also needed. With a lakehouse, such enterprise\n\nfeatures only need to be implemented, tested and administered for a single system.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Read the research**\n**Delta Lake: High-Performance ACID**\n**Table Storage Over Cloud Object Stores**\n\n**Abstract**\n\nCloud object stores such as Amazon S3 are some of the largest and most\n\ncost-effective storage systems on the planet, making the main attractive\n\ntarget to store large data warehouses and data lakes. Unfortunately, their\n\nimplementation as key-value stores makes it difficult to achieve ACID\n\ntransactions and high performance: Metadata operations, such as listing\n\nobjects, are expensive, and consistency guarantees are limited. In this paper,\n\nwe present Delta Lake, an open source ACID table storage layer over cloud\n\nobject stores initially developed at Databricks. Delta Lake uses a transaction log\n\nthat is compacted into Apache Parquet format to provide ACID properties, time\n\ntravel, and significantly faster metadata operations for large tabular data sets\n\n(e.g., the ability to quickly search billions of table partitions for those relevant\n\nto a query). It also leverages this design to provide high-level features such\n\nas automatic data layout optimization, upserts, caching, and audit logs. Delta\n\nLake tables can be accessed from Apache Spark, Hive, Presto, Redshift, and\n\nother systems. Delta Lake is deployed at thousands of Databricks customers\n\nthat process exabytes of data per day, with the largest instances managing\n\nexabyte-scale data sets and billions of objects.\n\nAuthors: Michael Armbrust, Tathagata Das, Liwen Sun, Burak Yavuz, Shixiong\n\nZhu, Mukul Murthy, Joseph Torres, Herman van H √ñ vell, Adrian Ionescu, Alicja\n\n≈Åuszczak, Micha≈Ç Szafra ÃÅnski, Xiao Li, Takuya Ueshin, Mostafa Mokhtar, Peter\n\nBoncz, Ali Ghodsi, Sameer Paranjpye, Pieter Senster, Reynold Xin, Matei Zaharia\n\nRead the full research paper on the [inner workings of the lakehouse.](https://databricks.com/research/delta-lake-high-performance-acid-table-storage-overcloud-object-stores)\n\n\n-----\n\n**Some early examples**\n\nThe [Databricks Unified Data Platform](https://databricks.com/product/data-lakehouse) has the architectural features of a lakehouse.\n\nMicrosoft‚Äôs Azure Synapse Analytics service, which [integrates with Azure Databricks](https://databricks.com/blog/2019/11/04/new-microsoft-azure-data-warehouse-service-and-azure-databricks-combine-analytics-bi-and-data-science.html) ,\n\nenables a similar lakehouse pattern. Other managed services such as BigQuery and\n\nRedshift Spectrum have some of the lakehouse features listed above, but they are\n\nexamples that focus primarily on BI and other SQL applications.\n\nCompanies that want to build and implement their own systems have access to open\n\nsource file formats (Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg, Apache Hudi) that are suitable for\n\nbuilding a lakehouse.\n\nMerging data lakes and data warehouses into a single system means that data teams\n\ncan move faster as they are able to use data without needing to access multiple systems.\n\nThe level of SQL support and integration with BI tools among these early lakehouses\n\nis generally sufficient for most enterprise data warehouses. Materialized views and\n\n\nA note about technical building blocks. While distributed file systems can be\n\nused for the storage layer, object stores are more commonly used in lakehouses.\n\nObject stores provide low-cost, highly available storage that excels at massively\n\nparallel reads ‚Äî an essential requirement for modern data warehouses.\n\n**From BI to AI**\n\nThe lakehouse is a new data management architecture that radically simplifies\n\nenterprise data infrastructure and accelerates innovation in an age when\n\nmachine learning is poised to disrupt every industry. In the past, most of the\n\ndata that went into a company‚Äôs products or decision-making was structured\n\ndata from operational systems, whereas today, many products incorporate\n\nAI in the form of computer vision and speech models, text mining and others.\n\nWhy use a lakehouse instead of a data lake for AI? A lakehouse gives you data\n\nversioning, governance, security and ACID properties that are needed even for\n\nunstructured data.\n\n\nstored procedures are available, but users may need to employ other mechanisms that\n\n\naren‚Äôt equivalent to those found in traditional data warehouses. The latter is particularly\n\nimportant for ‚Äúlift and shift scenarios,‚Äù which require systems that achieve semantics\n\nthat are almost identical to those of older, commercial data warehouses.\n\nWhat about support for other types of data applications? Users of a lakehouse have\n\naccess to a variety of standard tools ( [Apache Spark](https://databricks.com/glossary/apache-spark-as-a-service) , Python, R, machine learning\n\nlibraries) for non-BI workloads like data science and machine learning. Data\n\nexploration and refinement are standard for many analytic and data science\n\napplications. Delta Lake is designed to let users incrementally improve the quality of\n\n\nCurrent lakehouses reduce cost, but their performance can still lag specialized\n\nsystems (such as data warehouses) that have years of investments and real-\n\nworld deployments behind them. Users may favor certain tools (BI tools, IDEs,\n\nnotebooks) over others so lakehouses will also need to improve their UX and their\n\nconnectors to popular tools so they can appeal to a variety of personas. These\n\nand other issues will be addressed as the technology continues to mature and\n\ndevelop. Over time, lakehouses will close these gaps while retaining the core\n\nproperties of being simpler, more cost-efficient and more capable of serving\n\ndiverse data applications.\n\n\ndata in their lakehouse until it is ready for consumption.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Diving Deep Into the Inner Workings**\n**of the Lakehouse and Delta Lake**\n\n### CHAPTER 02\n\n\n-----\n\n**Diving Deep Into the**\n**Inner Workings of the**\n**Lakehouse and Delta Lake**\n# 02\n\nDatabricks wrote a [blog article](https://databricks.com/blog/2020/01/30/what-is-a-data-lakehouse.html) that outlined how more and more enterprises are\n\nadopting the lakehouse pattern. The blog created a massive amount of interest\n\nfrom technology enthusiasts. While lots of people praised it as the next-generation\n\ndata architecture, some people thought the lakehouse is the same thing as\n\nthe data lake. Recently, several of our engineers and founders wrote a research\n\npaper that describes some of the core technological challenges and solutions that\n\nset the lakehouse architecture apart from the data lake, and it was accepted and\n\npublished at the International Conference on Very Large Databases (VLDB) 2020. You\n\ncan read the paper, ‚Äú [Delta Lake: High-Performance ACID Table Storage Over Cloud](https://databricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/p975-armbrust.pdf)\n\n[Object Stores](https://databricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/p975-armbrust.pdf) ,‚Äù here.\n\nHenry Ford is often credited with having said, ‚ÄúIf I had asked people what they wanted,\n\nthey would have said faster horses.‚Äù The crux of this statement is that people often\n\nenvision a better solution to a problem as an evolution of what they already know\n\nrather than rethinking the approach to the problem altogether. In the world of data\n\nstorage, this pattern has been playing out for years. Vendors continue to try to reinvent\n\nthe old horses of data warehouses and data lakes rather than seek a new solution.\n\n\n-----\n\nMore than a decade ago, the cloud opened a new frontier for data storage. Cloud\n\nobject stores like Amazon S3 have become some of the largest and most cost-\n\neffective storage systems in the world, which makes them an attractive platform to\n\nstore data warehouses and data lakes. However, their nature as key-value stores\n\nmakes it difficult to achieve ACID transactions that many organizations require. Also,\n\nperformance is hampered by expensive metadata operations (e.g., listing objects)\n\nand limited consistency guarantees.\n\nBased on the characteristics of cloud object stores, three approaches have emerged.\n\n**1. Data lakes**\n\nThe first is directories of files (i.e., data lakes) that store the table as a collection\n\nof objects, typically in columnar format such as Apache Parquet. It‚Äôs an attractive\n\napproach because the table is just a group of objects that can be accessed from\n\na wide variety of tools without a lot of additional data stores or systems. However,\n\nboth performance and consistency problems are common. Hidden data corruption\n\nis common due to failed transactions, eventual consistency leads to inconsistent\n\nqueries, latency is high, and basic management capabilities like table versioning and\n\naudit logs are unavailable.\n\n**2. Custom storage engines**\n\nThe second approach is custom storage engines, such as proprietary systems built for\n\nthe cloud like the Snowflake data warehouse. These systems can bypass the consistency\n\nchallenges of data lakes by managing the metadata in a separate, strongly consistent\n\nservice that‚Äôs able to provide a single source of truth. However, all I/O operations need\n\nto connect to this metadata service, which can increase cloud resource costs and\n\nreduce performance and availability. Additionally, it takes a lot of engineering work to\n\nimplement connectors to existing computing engines like Apache Spark, TensorFlow\n\nand PyTorch, which can be challenging for data teams that use a variety of computing\n\nengines on their data. Engineering challenges can be exacerbated by unstructured\n\ndata because these systems are generally optimized for traditional structured\n\n\n-----\n\ndata types. Finally, and most egregiously, the proprietary metadata service locks\n\ncustomers into a specific service provider, leaving customers to contend with\n\nconsistently high prices and expensive, time-consuming migrations if they decide to\n\nadopt a new approach later.\n\n**3. Lakehouse**\n\nWith Delta Lake, an open source ACID table storage layer atop cloud object stores,\n\nwe sought to build a car instead of a faster horse with not just a better data store,\n\nbut a fundamental change in how data is stored and used via the lakehouse. A\n\nlakehouse is a new architecture that combines the best elements of data lakes and\n\ndata warehouses. Lakehouses are enabled by a new system design: implementing\n\nsimilar data structures and data management features to those in a data warehouse,\n\ndirectly on the kind of low-cost storage used for data lakes. They are what you would\n\nget if you had to redesign storage engines in the modern world, now that cheap and\n\nhighly reliable storage (in the form of object stores) are available.\n\nDelta Lake maintains information about which objects are part of a Delta table in an\n\nACID manner, using a write-ahead log, compacted into Parquet, that is also stored in\n\nthe cloud object store. This design allows clients to update multiple objects at once,\n\nreplace a subset of the objects with another, etc., in a serializable manner that still\n\nachieves high parallel read/write performance from the objects. The log also provides\n\nsignificantly faster metadata operations for large tabular data sets. Additionally, Delta\n\nLake offers advanced capabilities like time travel (i.e., the ability to query point-in-time\n\nsnapshots or roll back erroneous updates), automatic data layout optimization, upserts,\n\ncaching, and audit logs. Together, these features improve both the manageability and\n\nperformance of working with data in cloud object stores, ultimately opening the door\n\nto the lakehouse architecture that combines the key features of data warehouses and\n\ndata lakes to create a better, simpler data architecture.\n\n\n-----\n\nToday, Delta Lake is used across thousands of Databricks customers, processing\n\nexabytes of structured and unstructured data each day, as well as many organizations\n\nin the open source community. These use cases span a variety of data sources and\n\napplications. The data types stored include Change Data Capture (CDC) logs from\n\nenterprise OLTP systems, application logs, time-series data, graphs, aggregate\n\ntables for reporting, and image or feature data for machine learning. The applications\n\ninclude SQL workloads (most commonly), business intelligence, streaming, data\n\nscience, machine learning and graph analytics. Overall, Delta Lake has proven itself to\n\nbe a good fit for most data lake applications that would have used structured storage\n\nformats like Parquet or ORC, and many traditional data warehousing workloads.\n\nAcross these use cases, we found that customers often use Delta Lake to significantly\n\nsimplify their data architecture by running more workloads directly against cloud\n\nobject stores, and increasingly, by creating a lakehouse with both data lake and\n\ntransactional features to replace some or all of the functionality provided by message\n\nqueues (e.g., Apache Kafka), data lakes or cloud data warehouses (e.g., Snowflake,\n\nAmazon Redshift).\n\n**[In the research paper,](https://databricks.com/research/delta-lake-high-performance-acid-table-storage-overcloud-object-stores)** **the authors explain:**\n\n-  The characteristics and challenges of object stores\n\n-  The Delta Lake storage format and access protocols\n\n-  The current features, benefits and limitations of Delta Lake\n\n-  Both the core and specialized use cases commonly employed today\n\n-  Performance experiments, including TPC-DS performance\n\nThrough the paper, you‚Äôll gain a better understanding of Delta Lake and how it\n\nenables a wide range of DBMS-like performance and management features for data\n\nheld in low-cost cloud storage. As well as how the Delta Lake storage format and\n\naccess protocols make it simple to operate, highly available, and able to deliver high-\n\nbandwidth access to the object store.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Understanding Delta Engine**\n\n### CHAPTER 03\n\n\n-----\n\n**Understanding**\n**Delta Engine**\n# 03\n\nThe Delta Engine ties together a 100% Apache Spark-compatible vectorized query\n\nengine to take advantage of modern CPU architecture with optimizations to Spark\n\n3.0‚Äôs query optimizer and caching capabilities that were launched as part of Databricks\n\nRuntime 7.0. Together, these features significantly accelerate query performance on\n\ndata lakes, especially those enabled by [Delta Lake](https://databricks.com/product/delta-lake-on-databricks) , to make it easier for customers to\n\nadopt and scale a [lakehouse architecture](https://databricks.com/blog/2020/01/30/what-is-a-data-lakehouse.html) .\n\n**Scaling execution performance**\n\nOne of the big hardware trends over the last several years is that CPU clock speeds\n\nhave plateaued. The reasons are outside the scope of this chapter, but the takeaway\n\nis that we have to find new ways to process data faster beyond raw compute power.\n\nOne of the most impactful methods has been to improve the amount of data that can\n\nbe processed in parallel. However, data processing engines need to be specifically\n\narchitected to take advantage of this parallelism.\n\nIn addition, data teams are being given less and less time to properly model data as\n\nthe pace of business increases. Poorer modeling in the interest of better business\n\nagility drives poorer query performance. Naturally, this is not a desired state, and\n\norganizations want to find ways to maximize both agility and performance.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Announcing Delta Engine for**\n**high-performance query execution**\n\nDelta Engine accelerates the performance of Delta Lake for SQL and DataFrame\n\nworkloads through three components: an improved query optimizer, a caching\n\nlayer that sits between the execution layer and the cloud object storage, and a native\n\nvectorized execution engine that‚Äôs written in C++.\n\nThe improved query optimizer extends the functionality already in Spark 3.0 (cost-based\n\noptimizer, adaptive query execution, and dynamic runtime filters) with more advanced\n\nstatistics to deliver up to 18x increased performance in star schema workloads.\n\nDelta Engine‚Äôs caching layer automatically chooses which input data to cache for the\n\nuser, transcoding it along the way in a more CPU-efficient format to better leverage\n\nthe increased storage speeds of NVMe SSDs. This delivers up to 5x faster scan\n\nperformance for virtually all workloads.\n\nHowever, the biggest innovation in Delta Engine to tackle the challenges facing\n\ndata teams today is the native execution engine, which we call Photon. (We know.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt‚Äôs in an engine within the engine‚Ä¶). This completely rewritten execution engine for\n\nDatabricks has been built to maximize the performance from the new changes in\n\nmodern cloud hardware. It brings performance improvements to all workload types\n\nwhile remaining fully compatible with open Spark APIs.\n\n**Getting started with Delta Engine**\n\nBy linking these three components together, we think it will be easier for customers\n\nto understand how improvements in multiple places within the Databricks code\n\naggregate into significantly faster performance for analytics workloads on data lakes.\n\nWe‚Äôre excited about the value that Delta Engine delivers to our customers. While the\n\ntime and cost savings are already valuable, its role in the lakehouse pattern supports\n\nnew advances in how data teams design their data architectures for increased\n\nunification and simplicity.\n\nFor more information on the Delta Engine, watch this keynote address from\n\n[Spark + AI Summit 2020:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o54YMz8zvCY) [Delta Engine: High-Performance Query Engine for Delta Lake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o54YMz8zvCY) .\n\n\n-----\n\n## What‚Äôs  next?\n\n\nNow that you understand Delta Lake and how its features can improve\n\nperformance, it may be time to take a look at some additional resources.\n\n**Data + AI Summit Europe 2020 >**\n\n-  [Photon Technical Deep Dive: How to Think Vectorized](https://databricks.com/session_eu20/photon-technical-deep-dive-how-to-think-vectorized)\n\n\n**Explore subsequent eBooks in the collection >**\n\n-  The Delta Lake Series ‚Äî Fundamentals and Performance\n\n-  The Delta Lake Series ‚Äî Features\n\n-  The Delta Lake Series ‚Äî Streaming\n\n-  The Delta Lake Series ‚Äî Customer Use Cases\n\n\n\n-  [MLflow, Delta Lake and Lakehouse Use Cases Meetup and AMA](https://databricks.com/session_eu20/mlflow-delta-lake-and-lakehouse-use-cases-meetup)\n\n-  [Common Strategies for Improving Performance on Your Delta Lakehouse](https://databricks.com/session_eu20/common-strategies-for-improving-performance-on-your-delta-lakehouse)\n\n\n\n-  [Achieving Lakehouse Models With Spark 3.0](https://databricks.com/session_eu20/achieving-lakehouse-models-with-spark-3-0)\n\n-  [Radical Speed for Your SQL Queries With Delta Engine](https://databricks.com/session_eu20/radical-speed-for-your-sql-queries-with-delta-engine)\n\n\n**Do a deep dive into Delta Lake >**\n\n-  [Analytics on the Data Lake With Tableau and the Lakehouse Architecture](https://databricks.com/blog/2020/11/11/analytics-on-the-data-lake-with-tableau-and-the-lakehouse-architecture.html)\n\n-  [Visit the site for additional resources](https://databricks.com/product/delta-lake-on-databricks)\n\n\n**Vodcasts and podcasts >**\n\n\n\n-  [Welcome to Lakehouse.

This\nfragmentation makes it difficult to support new use cases for analytics or machine\nlearning, so many IT teams are now centralizing all of their data with a lakehouse\narchitecture built on top of Delta Lake, an open format storage layer.\n\nThe first thing data engineers need to do to support the lakehouse architecture is to\nefficiently move data from various systems into their lakehouse. Ingesting data is a\ncritical first step in the data engineering and management lifecycle.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Life of a Data Engineer\n\nThe primary focus of data engineers is to provide timely and reliable data to downstream\n\ndata teams at an organization. Requests for data can come from a variety of teams, and for\n\n\na variety of data types. For example:\n\n**‚Ä¢** Marketing team requests for Facebook and Google ad data in order to analyze spend and\n\nbetter allocate their budget for ads\n\n**‚Ä¢** Security team looking to get access to a table with low latency security data from Kafka,\n\nin order to run rules to detect intrusions into the network\n\n**‚Ä¢** Sales operations requesting customer data from Salesforce to enrich existing tables\n\n**‚Ä¢** Finance team hoping to find a way to automatically ingest critical data from Google\n\nSheets or transaction data from AWS Kinesis\n\nIn each of these common scenarios, data engineers must create usable and easily\n\nqueryable tables from semi-structured and unstructured data. Beyond writing queries to\n\nretrieve and transform all this data, the data engineering team must also be concerned\n\nwith performance, because running these queries on an ongoing basis can be a big load on\n\nthe system.\n\nData engineers face the challenge of constant requests and ongoing business\n\n\n###### W H AT I S \n D E LTA L A K E ?\n\nBefore thinking about ingestion into Delta Lake, it‚Äôs important to\n\nunderstand why ingesting into Delta Lake is the right solution in\n\nthe first place. [Delta Lake](https://databricks.com/product/delta-lake-on-databricks) is an open format data management\n\nlayer that brings data warehouse capabilities to your open data\n\nlake. Across industries, enterprises have enabled true collaboration\n\namong their data teams with a reliable single source of truth\n\nenabled by Delta Lake. By delivering quality, reliability, security and\n\nperformance on your data lake ‚Äî for both streaming and batch\n\noperations ‚Äî Delta Lake eliminates data silos and makes analytics\n\naccessible across the enterprise. With Delta Lake, customers can\n\nbuild a cost-efficient, highly scalable lakehouse that eliminates\n\ndata silos and provides self-serving analytics to end users.\n\n\nrequirements, as well as an ever-changing ecosystem. As business requirements change,\n\nso do the requirements around schemas, necessitating custom code to handle the\n\nchanges. With all of these challenges, the work of a data engineer is extremely critical, and\n\nincreasingly complex, with many steps involved before getting data to a state where it can\n\nactually be queried by the business stakeholders. So how do data engineers get the data\n\nthat each of these teams need at the frequency, with the freshness, and in the format\n\nrequired?\n\n\n-----\n\n### Ingesting From Cloud Object Stores\n\nThere are a number of common ways in which data engineers ingest data into Delta Lake. First and foremost is ingesting files from\n\ncloud object stores such as Azure Data Lake Storage, AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage. Typically, customers are looking to migrate\n\nexisting tables or perform incremental ingestion into Delta Lake, and to do so, they can leverage tools like [CONVERT TO DELTA](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/spark-sql/language-manual/delta-convert-to-delta.html) ,\n\n[COPY INTO](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/spark-sql/language-manual/delta-copy-into.html) , and [Auto Loader](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/structured-streaming/auto-loader.html) . We will focus on Auto Loader and COPY INTO here.\n\n\n**Auto Loader**\n\nAuto Loader is an optimized data ingestion tool that incrementally and efficiently\n\nprocesses new data files as they arrive in cloud storage with minimal DevOps effort. You\n\njust need to provide a source directory path and start a streaming job. The new structured\n\nstreaming source, called ‚ÄúcloudFiles‚Äù, will automatically set up file notification services that\n\n\n**COPY INTO**\n\nCOPY INTO is a SQL command that allows you to perform batch file ingestion into Delta\n\nLake. COPY INTO is a command that ingests files with exactly-once semantics, best used\n\nwhen the input directory contains thousands of files or fewer, and the user prefers SQL.\n\nCOPY INTO can be used over JDBC to push data into Delta Lake at your convenience.\n\n\nsubscribe file events from the input directory and process new files as they arrive, with the\n\noption of also processing existing files in that directory. Auto Loader has interfaces through\n\nPython and Scala, and can be used with SQL through Delta Live Tables.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### COPY INTO\n\n\nCOPY INTO is a powerful yet simple SQL command that allows you to perform batch file\n\ningestion into Delta Lake and perform many of the use cases outlined in this section. COPY\n\nINTO can be run once, in an ad hoc manner, and can be scheduled through Databricks jobs.\n\n```\nFILEFORMAT = CSV\nFORMAT_OPTIONS (‚Äòheader‚Äô = ‚Äòtrue‚Äô)\n\n```\n\nWhile COPY INTO does not support low latencies, you can trigger a COPY INTO based on\n\n\nevents by using cloud functions such as AWS Lambda or through orchestrators like Apache\n\nAirflow. COPY INTO supports incremental appends and simple transformations.\n\nCOPY INTO is a great command to use when your source directory contains a small number\n\nof files (i.e., thousands of files or less). To ingest a larger number of files, we recommend\n\nAuto Loader, which we will cover later in this eBook.\n\n**Common Use Cases for COPY INTO**\n\n**Ingesting data to a new Delta table**\n\nA common ad hoc ingestion use case using COPY INTO is to ingest data into a new Delta\n\ntable. To copy data into a new Delta table, users can use CREATE TABLE command first,\n\nfollowed by COPY INTO.\n\nStep 1: `CREATE TABLE` `my_table (id` `INT` `, name STRING, age` `INT` `);`\nStep 2 1 : `COPY INTO` `my_table`\n```\n FROM ‚Äòs3://my_bucket/my_path‚Äô WITH (\n  CREDENTIAL (\n   AWS_ACCESS_KEY = ‚Äò*****‚Äô,\n   AWS_SECRET_KEY = ‚Äò*****‚Äô,\n   AWS_SESSION_TOKEN = ‚Äò*****‚Äô\n  )\n  ENCRYPTION (\n   TYPE = ‚ÄòAWS_SSE_C‚Äô,\n   MASTER_KEY = ‚Äò*****‚Äô\n\n```\n\nThe code block above covers the AWS temporary in-line credential format. When you use\n\nin-line credentials in Azure and AWS, the following parameters are required for each type of\n\ncredential and encryption:\n\n\n|Credential Name|Required Parameters|\n|---|---|\n|AWS temporary credentials|AWS_ACCESS_KEY AWS_SECRET_KEY|\n||AWS_SESSION_TOKEN|\n|Azure SAS token|AZURE_SAS_TOKEN|\n\n\n\n\n\n|Encryption Name|Required Parameters|\n|---|---|\n|AWS server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption key|TYPE = ‚ÄòAWS_SSE_C‚Äô MASTER_KEY|\n|Azure client-provided encryption key|ATYPE = ‚ÄòAZURE_CSE‚Äô MASTER_KEY|\n\n\n**Appending data to your Delta table**\n\nTo append data to a Delta table, users can leverage the COPY INTO command. COPY INTO\n\nis a powerful SQL command that is idempotent and incremental. When using COPY INTO,\n\nusers point to a location of files, and once those files are ingested, Delta Lake will keep\n\n1 If you only have temporary access to a cloud object store, you can use temporary in-line credentials to ingest data from\nthe cloud object store. When you are an admin or with ANY FILE access, and the instance profile has been set for the\ncloud object store, you do not need to specify credentials in-line for COPY INTO.\n\n\n-----\n\ntrack of the state of files that have been ingested. Unlike commands like INSERT INTO, users\n\nget idempotency with COPY INTO, which means users are prevented from ingesting the\n\nsame data twice to the same table.\n```\n COPY INTO table_identifier\n FROM [ file_location | ( SELECT expression_list FROM file_location)]\n FILEFORMAT = JSON | CSV | TEXT | PARQUET | AVRO | ORC | BINARYFILE\n [ FILES = [file_name [,...] | PATTERN = ‚Äòregex_pattern‚Äô ]\n [ FORMAT_OPTIONS ( ‚Äòdata_source_reader_option‚Äô = ‚Äòvalue‚Äô [, ...])]\n [ COPY_OPTIONS ( ‚ÄôOPTION‚Äô = ‚ÄòVALUE‚Äô [,...])]\n\n```\nOne of the main benefits of COPY INTO is that users don‚Äôt have to worry about providing a\n\nschema, because the schema is automatically inferred from your data files. Here is a very\n\nsimple example of how you would ingest data from CSV files that have headers, where you\n\nleave the tool to infer the schema and the proper data types. It‚Äôs as simple as that.\n```\n COPY INTO my_delta_table\n FROM ‚Äòs3://my-bucket/path/to/csv_files‚Äô\n FILEFORMAT = CSV\n FORMAT_OPTIONS ( ‚Äòheader‚Äô = ‚Äòtrue‚Äô , ‚ÄòinferSchema‚Äô = ‚Äòtrue‚Äô )\n\n```\n**Using COPY INTO without an existing table** 2\n\n```\n CREATE TABLE my_delta_table (dummy string);\n COPY INTO my_delta_table\n FROM ‚Äòs3://my-bucket/path/to/csv_files‚Äô\n FILEFORMAT = CSV\n FORMAT_OPTIONS (\n  ‚Äòheader‚Äô = ‚Äòtrue‚Äô ,\n  ‚ÄòinferSchema‚Äô = ‚Äòtrue‚Äô ,\n  ‚ÄòmergeSchema‚Äô = ‚Äòtrue‚Äô\n )\n COPY_OPTIONS ( ‚Äòoverwrite‚Äô = ‚Äòtrue‚Äô , ‚ÄòoverwriteSchema‚Äô = ‚Äòtrue‚Äô )\n\n```\n**Ingesting a CSV file without headers**\n\nIf you are looking to ingest a CSV file that doesn‚Äôt have headers, columns will be named as\n\n_c0 or _c1, with the index of the column. You can use the double colon syntax to cast the\n\ndata type that you want and then alias these columns to whatever you want to call them.\n```\n COPY INTO my_delta_table\n FROM ( SELECT\n  _c0::int as key,\n  _c1::double value,\n  _c2::timestamp event_time\n  FROM ‚Äòs3://my-bucket/path/to/csv_files‚Äô )\n FILEFORMAT = CSV\n\n```\n\nIn the most common case, in order to use COPY INTO, a table definition is required.\n\nHowever, if you would like to get started quickly and don‚Äôt have an existing table or require\n\na specific schema, you can create your table with a dummy schema. Then, once you run\n\nCOPY INTO, you can overwrite the table and overwrite the schema. COPY INTO will actually\n\ninfer the data types, and then change your Delta table to have the required schema.\n\n2 This use case will not work in Databricks SQL workspace, as it currently only works on clusters without table ACLs.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Evolving schema over time for CSV files** 3\n\nWhen ingesting CSV files that have a different number of columns than your existing table,\n\nyou can use the option ‚Äú‚ÄòmergeSchema‚Äô = ‚Äòtrue‚Äô‚Äù. This option needs to be provided both\n\nas FORMAT_OPTIONS and COPY_OPTIONS. FORMAT_OPTIONS applies to the source data.\n\nOnce ‚ÄúmergeSchema‚Äù is provided as a format option, Databricks will look at multiple CSV\n\nfiles and infer the schema across those files. COPY_OPTIONS applies to your Delta table\n\nwhen you‚Äôre running the COPY INTO command. When ‚ÄúmergeSchema‚Äù is provided as a\n\ncopy option, you‚Äôre instructing Delta Lake that it is safe to evolve the schema. Schema\n\nevolution only allows the addition of new columns. Data type changes for existing columns\n\nare not supported.\n```\n COPY INTO my_delta_table\n FROM (SELECT\n  _C0::int as key,\n  _C1::double value,\n  _C2::timestamp event_time,\n  ...\n  FROM ‚Äòs3://my-bucket/path/to/csv_files‚Äô )\n FILEFORMAT = CSV\n FORMAT_OPTIONS ( ‚ÄòmergeSchema‚Äô = ‚Äòtrue‚Äô )\n COPY_OPTIONS ( ‚ÄòmergeSchema‚Äô = ‚Äòtrue‚Äô )\n\n```\n\n**Fixing bad data**\n\nIf you find that there is a mistake in the source data file and some of the data you ingested\n\nis bad, you can use RESTORE on your Delta table and set it to the timestamp or version of\n\nthe Delta table that you want to roll back to (e.g., to restore to yesterday‚Äôs data). Then you\n\ncan rerun your COPY INTO command.\n\nAlternatively, if running a RESTORE is not possible, COPY INTO supports reloading files by\n\nthe use of the ‚Äúforce‚Äù copy option. You can manually remove the old data from your Delta\n\nLake table by running a DELETE operation and then using COPY INTO with ‚Äúforce‚Äù = ‚Äútrue‚Äù.\n\nYou can use the PATTERN keyword to provide a file name pattern, or you can specify the file\n\nnames with the FILES keyword to reload a subset of files in conjunction with ‚Äúforce‚Äù.\n```\n RESTORE my_delta_table TO TIMESTAMP AS OF date_sub(current_date(),\n 1);\n COPY INTO my_delta_table\n FROM ‚Äòs3://my-bucket/path/to/csv_files‚Äô\n FILEFORMAT = CSV\n PATTERN = ‚Äò2021-09-08*.csv‚Äô\n FORMAT_OPTIONS ( ‚Äòheader‚Äô = ‚Äòtrue‚Äô , ‚ÄòinferSchema‚Äô = ‚Äòtrue‚Äô )\n COPY_OPTIONS ( ‚Äòforce‚Äô = ‚Äòtrue‚Äô )\n\n```\n3 Limitation: schema evolution with ‚ÄúmergeSchema‚Äù in COPY_OPTIONS does not work in Databricks SQL workspace or\nclusters enabled with table ACLs.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Auto Loader\n\n\nWhile COPY INTO can solve a lot of the key use cases our customers face, due to its\n\nlimitations (scalability), there are many scenarios where we recommend Auto Loader\n\nfor data ingestion. Auto Loader is a data source on Databricks that incrementally and\n\nefficiently processes new data files as they arrive in cloud storage with minimal DevOps\n\neffort. Auto Loader is available in Python and Scala, and also in SQL in [Delta Live Tables](https://databricks.com/product/delta-live-tables) .\n\nAuto Loader is an incremental streaming source that provides exactly-once ingestion\n\nguarantees. It keeps track of which files have been ingested using a durable key-value store.\n\nIt can discover new files very efficiently and is extremely scalable. Auto Loader has been\n\nbattle tested. We have seen customers running Auto Loader on millions of files an hour, and\n\npetabytes of data per day.\n\nTo use Auto Loader, you simply specify ‚ÄòreadStream‚Äô and the format ‚ÄúcloudFiles‚Äù, indicating\n\nthat you will use Auto Loader to load files from the cloud object stores. Next, you specify\n\nthe format of the file ‚Äî for example, JSON ‚Äî as an option to Auto Loader, and you specify\n\nwhere to load it from.\n```\n df = spark.readStream.format( ‚ÄúcloudFiles‚Äù )\n  .option( ‚Äúcloudfiles.format‚Äù , ‚Äújson‚Äù )\n  .load( ‚Äú/path/to/table‚Äù )\n\n```\nUnder the hood, when data lands in your cloud storage, Auto Loader discovers files either\n\nthrough directory listing or file notifications. Given permissions to the underlying storage\n\nbucket or container, Auto Loader can list the directory that you want to load data from\n\nin an efficient and scalable manner and load data immediately. Alternatively, Auto Loader\n\ncan also automatically set up file notifications on your storage account, which allows it\n\n\nfrom queues, deduplicate these notifications using its key-value store and then process\n\nthe underlying files. If there are any failures, Auto Loader will replay what hasn‚Äôt been\n\nprocessed, giving you exactly-once semantics.\n\nDirectory listing mode is very easy to get started with. If your files are uploaded to your\n\ncloud storage system in a lexicographical order, Auto Loader will optimize the discovery of\n\nfiles by starting directory listing from the latest uploaded files, saving you both time and\n\nmoney. If files cannot be uploaded in a lexicographical order and you need Auto Loader\n\nto scale to high volumes, Databricks recommends using the file notification mode. Cloud\n\nservices such as AWS Kinesis Firehose, AWS DMS and Azure Data Factory can be configured\n\nto upload files in a lexical order, typically by providing the upload time of records in the file\n\npath, such as /base/path/yyyy/MM/dd/HH/file.format.\n\n**Common Use Cases for Auto Loader**\n\n**New to Auto Loader**\n\nAs a new user to the Databricks Lakehouse, you‚Äôll want to ingest data from cloud object\n\nstores into Delta Lake as part of your data pipeline for incremental loading. Here is a simple\n\nexample using Python to demonstrate the ease and flexibility of Auto Loader with a few\n\ndefined options. You can run the code in a notebook.\n```\n stream = spark.readStream \\\n  .format( ‚ÄúcloudFiles‚Äù ) \\\n  .option( ‚ÄúcloudFiles.format‚Äù , ‚Äúcsv‚Äù ) \\\n  .option( ‚ÄúcloudFiles.schemaLocation‚Äù , schema_location) \\\n  .load(raw_data_location)\n\n```\n\nto efficiently discover newly arriving files. When a file lands in file notification mode, the\n\ncloud storage system sends a notification to a queuing system. For example, in AWS, S3\n\nwill send a notification to AWS SQS. On Azure, a notification is sent to Azure queue storage.\n\nOn Google, it‚Äôll be sent to Pub/Sub. Auto Loader can then fetch these event notifications\n\n\n-----\n\nIn order to write to a Delta table from the stream, follow the example below:\n```\n stream.writeStream \\\n   .option( ‚ÄúmergeSchema‚Äù , ‚Äútrue‚Äù ) \\\n   .option( ‚ÄúcheckpointLocation‚Äù , checkpoint_location) \\\n   .start(target_delta_table_location)\n\n```\n**Migrating to Auto Loader**\n\nAs a Spark user, you may be using an existing Spark structured streaming to process data.\n\nTo migrate to Auto Loader, all a user needs to do is take existing streaming code and turn\n\ntwo lines of it into ‚ÄòcloudFiles‚Äô, specifying the file format within an option.\n\n\n**Migrating a livestreaming pipeline**\n\nMigrating a livestreaming pipeline can be challenging, but with Auto Loader, as with COPY\n\nINTO, you can specify a timestamp when the source files are updated or created and Auto\n\nLoader will ingest all modified data after that point.\n```\n df = spark.readStream\n  .format( ‚ÄúcloudFiles‚Äù )\n  .option( ‚ÄúcloudFiles.format‚Äù , ‚Äújson‚Äù )\n  .option( ‚ÄúmodifiedAfter‚Äù , ‚Äú2021-09-09 00:00:00‚Äù )\n  .options(format_options)\n  .schema(schema)\n  .load( ‚Äú/path/to/table‚Äù )\n\n```\n**Schema inference and evolution**\n\nAuto Loader provides schema inference and management capabilities. With a schema\n\nlocation specified, Auto Loader can store the changes to the inferred schema over time. For\n\nfile formats like JSON and CSV, where the schemas can get fuzzy, schema inference on Auto\n\nLoader can automatically infer data types or treat everything as a string.\n\nWhen data does not match your schema (e.g., an unknown column or format), Auto Loader\n\nhas a data rescue capability that will ‚Äúrescue‚Äù all data in a separate column, stored as a\n\nJSON string, to investigate later. See [rescued data column](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/structured-streaming/auto-loader-schema.html#rescued-data-column) for more details.\n\nAuto Loader supports three schema evolution modes: add new columns as they are\n\ndiscovered, fail if an unexpected column is seen, or rescue new columns.\n\n```\ndf = spark.readStream\n .format( ‚ÄúcloudFiles‚Äù )\n .option( ‚ÄúcloudFiles.\nformat‚Äù , ‚Äújson‚Äù )\n .options(format_options)\n .schema(schema)\n .load( ‚Äú/path/to/table‚Äù )\n\n```\n```\ndf = spark.readStream\n .format( ‚Äújson‚Äù )\n .options(format_options)\n .schema(schema)\n .load( ‚Äú/path/to/table‚Äù )\n\n```\n\nOnce it‚Äôs converted, users will see instant benefits like scalability and cost reduction. Auto\n\nLoader can scale to trillions of files, unlike the open-source file streaming source. One of\n\nthe ways that Auto Loader does this is with asynchronous backfills. Instead of needing\n\nto discover files first, then plan, Auto Loader discovers and processes files concurrently,\n\nmaking it much more efficient and leading to cost reductions in compute resources.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Fixing a file that was processed with Auto Loader**\n\nTo fix a file that was already processed, Auto Loader supports an option called\n\n‚ÄòallowOverwrites‚Äô. With this option, Auto Loader can re-ingest and reprocess a file with a\n\nnew timestamp. If you want to enable this option in an existing Auto Loader stream, you\n\nneed to stop and restart the Auto Loader stream with the enabled option.\n```\n df = spark.readStream\n  .format( ‚ÄúcloudFiles‚Äù )\n  .option( ‚ÄúcloudFiles.format‚Äù , ‚Äújson‚Äù )\n  .schema(schema)\n  .option( ‚ÄúcloudFiles.allowOverwrites‚Äù , ‚Äútrue‚Äù )\n  .options(format_options)\n  .load( ‚Äú/path/to/table‚Äù )\n\n```\n**Discover missing data**\n\nWhile event notification is a very scalable method to collect all data, it relies on cloud\n\nservices, which are distributed systems and are not always reliable. With Auto Loader, you\n\ncan additionally specify a backfill interval, where Auto Loader will perform asynchronous\n\nbackfills at whatever interval you set up. This can be enabled with a once trigger,\n\n```\n df = spark.readStream\n  .format(‚ÄúcloudFiles‚Äù)\n  .option(‚ÄúcloudFiles.format‚Äù, ‚Äújson‚Äù)\n  .schema(schema)\n  .option( ‚ÄúcloudFiles.backfillInterval‚Äù , ‚Äú1 week‚Äù )\n  .options(format_options)\n  .load(‚Äú/path/to/table‚Äù)\n  .writeStream\n  .trigger(Trigger.AvailableNow())\n  .option(‚ÄúcheckpointLocation‚Äù, checkpointDir)\n  .start()\n\n```\nThe trigger tells Auto Loader how frequently to process incoming data. A processing time\n\ntrigger will have Auto Loader run continuously and schedule micro-batches at the trigger\n\ninterval which you have set. The ‚ÄúOnce‚Äù and ‚ÄúAvailableNow‚Äù triggers instruct Auto Loader to\n\nprocess all new data that has been added until the start of your application. Once the data\n\nis processed, Auto Loader will automatically shut down. Trigger Once will have Auto Loader\n\nprocess all the new data in a single micro-batch, which requires it to first discover all the\n\nnew files. With Trigger AvailableNow, Auto Loader can discover and process files concurrently\n\nand perform rate limiting, which makes it a preferable alternative to Trigger Once.\n\n\nprocessing time trigger and available now trigger. The following example shows how to use\n\nbackfill internal and trigger availableNow together:\n\n\n-----\n\n**Using Auto Loader in SQL with Delta Live Tables**\n\nDelta Live Tables is a cloud-native ETL service on Databricks that provides a reliable\n\nframework to develop, test, monitor, manage and operationalize data pipelines at scale to\n\ndrive insights for data science, machine learning and analytics. Auto Loader is available in\n\nDelta Live Tables.\n\n```\nCREATE INCREMENTAL LIVE TABLE\n  autoloader_test\nAS\nSELECT\n *,\n id + id2 AS new_id\nFROM\n CLOUD_FILES (\n  ‚Äúsome/cloud/path‚Äù , ‚Äì the path to the data\n  ‚Äújson‚Äù ‚Äì the file format\n );\n\n```\n\n**Live Tables understands**\n\n**and coordinates data flow**\n\n**between your queries**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Ingesting Data From External Applications\n\nWhile Auto Loader and COPY INTO are powerful tools, not all data is available as files\n\nin cloud object stores. In order to enable a lakehouse, it is critical to incorporate all of\n\nyour data and break down the silos between sources and downstream teams. To do this,\n\ncustomers need to discover and connect a broad set of data, BI and AI tools, and systems\n\nto the data within their lakehouse.\n\n##### Partner Connect\n\nHistorically, stitching multiple enterprise tools and data sources together has been a burden\n\non the end user, making it very complicated and expensive to execute at any scale. Partner\n\nConnect solves this challenge by making it easy for you to integrate data, analytics and AI\n\ntools directly within their Databricks Lakehouse. It also allows you to discover new, pre-\n\nvalidated solutions from Databricks partners that support your expanding analytics needs.\n\nTo ingest into the lakehouse, select the partner tile in Partner Connect via the left\n\nnavigation bar in Databricks. Partner Connect will automatically configure resources such\n\nas clusters, tokens and connection files for you to connect with your data ingestion tools\n\nof choice. You can finish signing up for a trial account on the partner‚Äôs website or directly\n\nlog in if you already used Partner Connect to create a trial account. Once you log in, you will\n\nsee that Databricks is already configured as a destination in the partner portal and ready\n\nto be used.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Common Use Case for Partner Connect**\n\n**Ingest Salesforce data via Fivetran into Delta Lake**\n\nClicking on the Fivetran tile in Partner Connect starts an automated workflow between\n\nthe two products. Databricks automatically provisions a SQL endpoint and associated\n\ncredentials for Fivetran to interact with, and passes the user‚Äôs identity and the SQL\n\n\nendpoint configuration to Fivetran automatically via a secure API. Within Fivetran, a\n\nDatabricks destination is automatically created. This destination is configured to ingest into\n\nDelta via the SQL endpoint that was auto-configured by Partner Connect.\n\nThe customer now selects their choice of data source in Fivetran from hundreds of pre-\n\nbuilt connectors ‚Äî for example, Salesforce. The user authenticates to the Salesforce\n\nsource, chooses the Salesforce objects they want to ingest into Delta Lake on Databricks\n\n\n-----\n\n(in this case the Account & Contact objects) and starts the initial sync. This automation\n\nhas saved users dozens of manual steps and copying/pasting of configuration if they\n\nmanually set up the connection. It also protects the user from making any unintentional\n\nconfiguration errors and spending time debugging those errors. The Salesforce tables\n\nare now available to query, join and analyze in Databricks SQL.

Recent\nadvancements in large language models (LLMs) are propelling\ncompanies to rethink AI within their own data strategies.\nGiven the rapidly evolving DS/ML landscape, we wanted to\nunderstand several aspects of the market:\n\n-  Which types of DS/ML applications are companies investing\nin?

It includes libraries used\nfor the particular problem-solving use\ncases mentioned. It does not include\nlibraries used in tooling for data\npreparations and modeling.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nNatural language processing dominates\n\nmachine learning use cases\n\n```\n\nOur second most popular DS/ML application is\nsimulations and optimization, which accounts for 30% of\nall use cases. This signals organizations are using data to\nmodel prototypes and solve problems cost-effectively.\n\n\nTo understand how organizations are applying AI and\nML within the Lakehouse, we aggregated the usage\nof specialized Python libraries, which include NLTK,\nTransformers and FuzzyWuzzy, into popular data science\nuse cases. 1 We look at data from these libraries because\nPython is on the cutting edge of new developments in ML,\nadvanced analytics and AI, and has consistently ranked\nas one of the [most popular programming languages](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) in\nrecent years.\n\nOur most popular use case is natural language processing\n(NLP), a rapidly growing field that enables businesses to\ngain value from unstructured textual data. This opens the\ndoor for users to accomplish tasks that were previously\ntoo abstract for code, such as summarizing content or\nextracting sentiment from customer reviews. In our data\nset, 49% of libraries used are associated with NLP. LLMs\nalso fall within this bucket. Given the innovations launched\nin recent months, we expect to see NLP take off even\nmore in coming years as it is applied to use cases like\nchatbots, research assistance, fraud detection, content\ngeneration and more.\n\n```\n   In our data set, 49% of\n specialized Python libraries\n used are associated with NLP\n\n```\nMany of the DS/ML use cases are predominantly\nleveraged by specific industries. While they take up a\nsmaller share of the total, they are mission-critical for\nmany organizations. For example, time series includes\nforecasting, a use case that is especially popular in\nindustries such as Retail and CPG, which rely heavily\non the ability to forecast the need for every item in\nevery store.\n\n\n1.

LLMs have been instrumental in enabling\nmachines to understand, interpret and generate human language\nin a way that was previously impossible, powering everything\nfrom machine translation to content creation to virtual assistants\nand chatbots.\n\nTransformer-related libraries have been growing in popularity\neven before ChatGPT thrust LLMs into the public consciousness.\nWithin the last 6 months, our data shows two accelerating\ntrends: organizations are building their own LLMs, which models\nlike [Dolly](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/04/12/dolly-first-open-commercially-viable-instruction-tuned-llm) show can be quite accessible and inexpensive. And,\nthey are using proprietary models like ChatGPT. Transformerrelated libraries, such as Hugging Face, which are used to train\nLLMs, have the highest adoption within the Lakehouse.\n\nThe second most popular type is SaaS LLMs, which are used\nto access models like OpenAI. This category has grown\nexponentially in parallel with the [launch of ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) : the\nnumber of Lakehouse customers using SaaS LLMs has grown\n\n\nOrganizations can leverage LLMs either by\nusing SaaS LLM APIs to call services like\nChatGPT from OpenAI or by operating their\nown LLMs in-house.\n\nThinking of building your own modern LLM\napplication? This approach could entail\nthe use of specialized transformer-related\nPython libraries to train the model, as well as\nLLM tools like LangChain to develop prompt\ninterfaces or integrations to other systems.\n```\nLLM DEFINITIONS\n\n```\n**‚óä** **Transformer-related libraries:**\nPython libraries used to train LLMs\n(example: Hugging Face)\n\n**‚óä** **SaaS LLM APIs:** Libraries used to access\nLLMs as a service (example: OpenAI)\n\n**‚óä** **LLM tools:** Toolchains for working\nwith and building proprietary LLMs\n(example: LangChain)\n\n\nan impressive 1310% between the end of November 2022 and\nthe beginning of May 2023. (In contrast, transformer-related\nlibraries grew 82% in this same period.)\n\n\n-----\n\n```\n ac e ea g e pe e a o a d p oduc o\ntake off across industries\n\n```\n\nThe increasing demand for ML solutions and the growing\navailability of technologies have led to a significant\nincrease in experimentation and production, two distinct\nparts of the ML model lifecycle. We look at the _logging_ and\n_registering_ of models in MLflow, an open source platform\ndeveloped by Databricks, to understand how ML is\ntrending and being adopted within organizations.\n```\n   LOGGED MODELS AND\n\n   ML EXPERIMENTATION\n\n```\nDuring the experimentation phase of ML, data scientists\ndevelop models designed to solve given tasks. After training\nthe models, they test them to evaluate their accuracy,\nprecision, recall (the percentage of correctly predicted\npositive instances out of all actual positive instances), and\nmore. These metrics are logged (recorded) in order to analyze\nthe various models‚Äô performance and identify which approach\nworks best for the given task.\n\nWe have chosen logged models as a proxy to measure ML\nexperimentation because the MLflow Tracking Server is\n\ndesigned to facilitate experiment tracking and reproducibility.\n\n\nMLflow Model Registry launched in May 2021. Overall, the\nnumber of logged models has grown 54% since February\n2022, while the number of registered models has grown\n411% over the same period. This growth in volume suggests\norganizations are understanding the value of investing in\nand allocating more people power to ML.\n```\nREGISTERED MODELS AND ML PRODUCTION\n\n```\nProduction models have undergone the experimentation\nphase and are then deployed in real-world applications. They\nare typically used to make predictions or decisions based on\nnew data. Registering a model is the process of recording and\nstoring metadata about a trained model in a centralized location\nthat allows users to easily access and reuse existing models.\nRegistering models prior to production enables organizations to\nensure consistency and reliability in model deployment and scale.\n\nWe have chosen registered models to represent ML production\nbecause the MLflow Model Registry is designed to manage\nmodels that have left the experimentation phase through the\n\nrest of their lifecycle.\n\n\n-----\n\ng y yi p\n\nwas registered. Recent advances in ML, such as improved\nopen source libraries like MLflow and Hugging Face, have\n\nradically simplified building and putting models into\nproduction. The result is that 34% of logged models are\nnow candidates for production today, an improvement\nfrom over 20% just a year ago.\n\n\nbefore committing an ML model to production.

Our data set confirms that BI tools\nare more widely adopted across organizations relative to\nmore nascent categories ‚Äî and they continue to grow,\nwith a 66% YoY increase in adoption. This aligns with the\nbroader trend of more organizations performing data\nwarehousing on a Lakehouse, covered in the next section,\nViews from the Lakehouse.\n\n\nWhile BI is often where organizations start their data\njourney, companies are increasingly looking at more\nadvanced data and AI use cases.\n```\nDEMAND FOR DATA INTEGRATION PRODUCTS\n\nIS GROWING FAST\n\n```\nWe see the fastest growth in the data integration market.\nThese tools enable a company to integrate vast amounts\nof upstream and downstream data in one consolidated\nview. Data integration products ensure that all BI and DS/\nML initiatives are built on solid foundation.\n\nWhile it‚Äôs easier for smaller markets to experience\nfaster growth, at 117% YoY increased adoption, the data\nintegration market is growing substantially faster than BI.\nThis trend dovetails with the rapid growth of ML adoption\nwe see across the Lakehouse, covered in the DS/ML\nsection of the report.\n\n```\nData integration is the\nfastest-growing market,\n\n with 117% YoY growth\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nViews from\nthe Lakehouse\nMIGRATION AND DATA\n\nFORMAT TRENDS\n\n```\nData migration is a major undertaking: it can be risky,\nexpensive and delay companies‚Äô timelines. It‚Äôs not a\ntask to jump into lightly. As organizations run into the\nlimitations, scalability challenges and the cost burden\nof legacy data platforms, they are increasingly likely\nto migrate to a new type of architecture.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nMigration trends:\n\nthe best data warehouse\n\nis a Lakehouse\n\n```\nThe Lakehouse Platform is an attractive\nalternative to traditional data warehouses\nbecause it supports advanced use cases and\nDS/ML, allowing organizations to boost their\noverall data strategy. As evidenced by the most\npopular data and AI products, with BI and data\nintegration tools at the top, organizations are\nincreasingly using the data lakehouse for data\nwarehousing. To better understand which legacy\nplatforms organizations are moving away from,\n\nwe look at the migrations of new customers\nto Databricks.\n\nAn interesting takeaway is that roughly half of the\ncompanies moving to the Lakehouse are coming\nfrom data warehouses. This includes the 22%\nthat are moving from cloud data warehouses.\nIt also demonstrates a growing focus on running\ndata warehousing workloads on a Lakehouse\nand unifying data platforms to reduce cost.\n\n```\n SOURCE OF NEW CUSTOMER \u0003\n\n MIGRATIONS TO DATABRICKS\n\n```\n```\n12%\n\n```\n```\n39%\n\n```\n```\n27%\n\n```\n```\n22%\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nRising tides: the volume\n\nof data in Delta Lake\n\nhas grown 304% YoY\n\n```\nAs the [volume of data explodes](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Adanma-Eberendu/publication/309393428_Unstructured_Data_an_overview_of_the_data_of_Big_Data/links/5bc89b5c458515f7d9c65beb/Unstructured-Data-an-overview-of-the-data-of-Big-Data.pdf) , an increasingly\nlarge proportion is in the form of semi-structured\nand unstructured data.

In fact, it is [reported](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20earliest%20examples,Heathrow%20Airport's%20Terminal%201) that the first application was\nover 25 years ago, during the early phases of foundation and cofferdam construction for the\nLondon Heathrow Express facilities, to monitor and predict foundation borehole grouting. In\nthe years since this first application, edge computing, AI, data connectivity, 5G connectivity\nand the improvements of the Internet of Things (IoT) have enabled digital twins to become\ncost-effective and are now an imperative in today‚Äôs data-driven businesses.\n\nToday‚Äôs manufacturing industries are expected to streamline and optimize all the processes in their value\nchain from product development and design, through operations and supply chain optimization to obtaining\nfeedback to reflect and respond to rapidly growing customer demands. The digital twins category is broad\nand is addressing a multitude of challenges within manufacturing, logistics and transportation.\n\n\n[In a case study published](https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Digital-twins-improve-real-life-manufacturing_010522.pdf)\n[in MIT Technology Review,](https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Digital-twins-improve-real-life-manufacturing_010522.pdf)\n[‚Äúprofit margins increased and](https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Digital-twins-improve-real-life-manufacturing_010522.pdf)\n[manufacturing time was reduced](https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Digital-twins-improve-real-life-manufacturing_010522.pdf)\n[when digital-twin technology](https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Digital-twins-improve-real-life-manufacturing_010522.pdf)\n[was implemented.

This figure is up from $3.1 billion in 2020\nat a CAGR of 58%, riding on the wave of Industry 4.0.\n\n\n**But challenges remain**\n\nThe most common challenges faced by the manufacturing industry that digital\ntwins are addressing include:\n\n**‚Ä¢** Product designs are more complex, resulting in higher cost and increasingly\nlonger development times\n\n**‚Ä¢** The supply chain is opaque\n\n**‚Ä¢** Production lines are not optimized ‚Äì performance variations, unknown defects\nand the projection of operating cost is obscure\n\n**‚Ä¢** Poor quality management ‚Äì overreliance on theory, managed by\nindividual departments\n\n**‚Ä¢** Reactive maintenance costs are too high, resulting in excessive downtime or\nprocess disruptions\n\n**‚Ä¢** Incongruous collaborations between departments\n\n**‚Ä¢** Invisibility of customer demand for gathering real-time feedback\n\n\nThe growth rate for digital twins is staggering with common adoption reported\nto be in the 25-40% CAGR growth rate.\n\n\n-----\n\n### Digital Twins Bring Broad Benefits to Manufacturing\n\nIndustry 4.0 and subsequent intelligent supply chain efforts have made significant strides in improving operations and building agile supply chains, efforts that\nwould have come at significant costs without digital twin technology.\n\n**Let‚Äôs look at the benefits that digital twins deliver to the manufacturing sector:**\n\n\n\n**‚Ä¢** Product design and development is performed with\nless cost and is completed in less time as iterative\nsimulations, using multiple constraints, deliver the\nbest or most optimized design. All commercial\naircraft are designed using digital twins.\n\n**‚Ä¢** Digital twins provide the awareness of how long\ninventory will last, when to replenish and how to\nminimize the supply chain disruptions. The oil and gas\nindustry, for example, uses supply chain‚Äìoriented\ndigital twins to reduce supply chain bottlenecks in\nstorage and midstream delivery, schedule tanker\noff-loads and model demand with externalities.\n\n\n\n**‚Ä¢** Continuous quality checks on produced items\nwith ML/AI generated feedback pre-emptively\nassuring improved product quality. Final paint\ninspection in the automotive industry, for example,\nis performed with computer vision built on top of\ndigital twin technology.\n\n**‚Ä¢** Striking the sweet spot between when to replace\na part before the process degrades or breaks\ndown and utilizing the components to their fullest,\ndigital twins provide manufacturers with realtime feedback. Digital twins are the backbone of\nbuilding an asset performance management suite.\n\n\n\n**‚Ä¢** Digital twins create the opportunity to have\nmultiple departments in sync by providing\nnecessary instructions modularly to attain\na required throughput. Digital twins are the\nbackbone of kaizen events that optimize\nmanufacturing process flow.\n\n**‚Ä¢** Customer feedback loops can be modeled through\ninputs, from point of sale customer behavior,\nbuying preferences, or product performance and\nthen integrated into the product development\nprocess, forming a closed loop providing an\nimproved product design.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Digital Twins Bring Broad Benefits to Manufacturing (continued)**\n\nThe top four use cases are heavily focused on operational processes and are typically the first to be deployed\nin manufacturing by a majority of companies. Those that have a lower adoption rate are more complex in\ndeployment, but typically offer higher and longer-lasting value.\n\n**[Digital Twin Use Case Deployment](https://blogs.3ds.com/exalead/2019/07/03/digital-twin-use-cases-in-manufacturing-part-5-12/)**\n\n\nImprove product quality\n\nReduce manufacturing costs\n\nReduce unplanned downtime\n\nIncrease throughput\n\nEnsure safe manufacturing\n\nTest new design ideas\n\nDevelop product enhancements\n\nDigital transformation of enterprise\n\nSpeed new product introduction\n\nReduce planned downtime\n\nMeet new regulatory challenges\n\nTraining for new manufacturing processes\n\nDesign changes to production line\n\nProvide service to end users customers\n\nUpdate products in the field\n\n\n**34%**\n\n\n**30%**\n\n**28%**\n**25%**\n\n**24%**\n\n\n**16%**\n\n**14%**\n\n**13%**\n\n**13%**\n\n**11%**\n**10%**\n\n**8%**\n**8%**\n\n\nCan you imagine the cost to change\nan oil refinery‚Äôs crude distillation\nunit process conditions to improve\nthe output of diesel one week\nand gasoline the next to address\nchanges in demand and ensure\nmaximum economic value?

The classic definition of\ndigital twin is: ‚Äú [A virtual model designed to accurately reflect a physical object](https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-a-digital-twin) .‚Äù\n\n\nFor a discrete or continuous manufacturing process, a digital twin gathers system\nand processes state data with the help of various IoT sensors [operational\ntechnology data (OT)] and enterprise data [informational technology (IT)] to form a\nvirtual model which is then used to run simulations, study performance issues and\ngenerate possible insights.\n\n\n**Types of Digital Twins**\n\n\n-----\n\n### Digital Twin Architectures\n\nClassic digital twins have been physics-based models of specific systems. More recently,\n**data-driven digital twins, which work on the real-time system data, are gaining prominence** .\n\n\nThese twins provide the opportunity to not just monitor and simulate system performance under specific\nconditions, but also provide the platform to further embed AI-based predictive and prescriptive solutions into\nthe industrial environment.\n\nDigital twins undergo a series of changes during their lifecycle to become completely autonomous.\n\n**Data-Driven Operational Digital Twins: Maturity Journey**\n\n**AI**\n\nSimulate & Optimize\n\n\n**[Digital twins have reduced](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/01/05/1042981/digital-twins-improve-real-life-manufacturing/)**\n**[automotive product design](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/01/05/1042981/digital-twins-improve-real-life-manufacturing/)**\n**[lifecycle from](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/01/05/1042981/digital-twins-improve-real-life-manufacturing/)**\n\n# 6-8 18-24\n## years to months\n\n\n**[Digital twins have reduced](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/01/05/1042981/digital-twins-improve-real-life-manufacturing/)**\n**[automotive product design](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/01/05/1042981/digital-twins-improve-real-life-manufacturing/)**\n**[lifecycle from](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/01/05/1042981/digital-twins-improve-real-life-manufacturing/)**\n\n\n**[Digital warehouse design lets](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/improving-warehouse-operations-digitally)**\n**[companies test and learn](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/improving-warehouse-operations-digitally)**\n**[using a digital twin, which can](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/improving-warehouse-operations-digitally)**\n**[improve efficiency by](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/improving-warehouse-operations-digitally)**\n\n# 20% to 25%\n\n\n**[Digital warehouse design lets](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/improving-warehouse-operations-digitally)**\n**[companies test and learn](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/improving-warehouse-operations-digitally)**\n**[using a digital twin, which can](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/improving-warehouse-operations-digitally)**\n**[improve efficiency by](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/improving-warehouse-operations-digitally)**\n\n\nIdentify next best action and\nintegrate with actuation systems\n\n\n**IoT**\n\n**Edge/**\n**Cloud**\n\n\n**Digital Twins**\n\n**ERP**\n\n\nPredict & Diagnose\n\n|Col1|I i|\n|---|---|\n\n\n\nPredictive maintenance, process\nimprovements and Root Causing\n\n\nMonitor & Alert\n\n|Col1|P i|\n|---|---|\n\n\nReal-time operations monitoring\nand alerting\n\n\n-----\n\n### How to Build a Digital Twin\n\n\nA data architecture capability is needed to capture\nand collect the ever-expanding volume and variety\nof data streaming in real time from example\nprotocols, such as ABB Total Flow, Allen Bradley,\nEmerson, Fanuc, GE, Hitachi and Mitsubishi.\n\n\nData collection, data analytics, application\nenablement and data integration orchestrate the\ntime-series data stream and transfer to the cloud.\nAzure IoT Hub is used to securely ingest data from\nedge to cloud.\n\n\nCloud infrastructure and analytics capabilities are\noffered within the flexibility of the cloud.

         "### EBOOK\n\n# A Compact Guide to Large Language Models\n\n\n-----\n\nSECTION 1\n## Introduction\n\n##### Definition of large language models (LLMs)\n\nLarge language models are AI systems that are designed to process and analyze\nvast amounts of natural language data and then use that information to generate\nresponses to user prompts. These systems are trained on massive data sets\nusing advanced machine learning algorithms to learn the patterns and structures\nof human language, and are capable of generating natural language responses to\na wide range of written inputs. Large language models are becoming increasingly\nimportant in a variety of applications such as natural language processing,\nmachine translation, code and text generation, and more.\n\nWhile this guide will focus on language models, it‚Äôs important to understand that\nthey are only one aspect under a larger generative AI umbrella. Other noteworthy\ngenerative AI implementations include projects such as art generation from text,\naudio and video generation, and certainly more to come in the near future.\n\n\n-----\n\n##### Extremely brief historical background and development of LLMs\n\n\n###### 1950s‚Äì1990s\nInitial attempts are made to map hard rules around languages and\nfollow logical steps to accomplish tasks like translating a sentence\nfrom one language to another.\n\nWhile this works sometimes, strictly defined rules only work for\nconcrete, well-defined tasks that the system has knowledge about.\n\n###### 1990s \nLanguage models begin evolving into statistical models and\nlanguage patterns start being analyzed, but larger-scale projects\nare limited by computing power.\n\n###### 2000s \nAdvancements in machine learning increase the complexity of\nlanguage models, and the wide adoption of the internet sees an\n\nenormous increase in available training data.\n\n###### 2012 \nAdvancements in deep learning architectures and larger data sets\nlead to the development of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer).\n\n\n###### 2018\nGoogle introduces BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations\nfrom Transformers), which is a big leap in architecture and paves\nthe way for future large language models.\n\n###### 2020\nOpenAI releases GPT-3, which becomes the largest model at\n175B parameters and sets a new performance benchmark for\nlanguage-related tasks.\n\n###### 2022\nChatGPT is launched, which turns GPT-3 and similar models into\na service that is widely accessible to users through a web interface\nand kicks off a huge increase in public awareness of LLMs and\ngenerative AI.\n\n###### 2023\nOpen source LLMs begin showing increasingly impressive results\nwith releases such as Dolly 2.0, LLaMA, Alpaca and Vicuna.\nGPT-4 is also released, setting a new benchmark for both parameter\nsize and performance.\n\n\n-----\n\nSECTION 2\n## Understanding Large Language Models\n\n\n##### What are language models and how do they work?\n\nLarge language models are advanced artificial intelligence systems that take\nsome input and generate humanlike text as a response. They work by first\nanalyzing vast amounts of data and creating an internal structure that models\nthe natural language data sets that they‚Äôre trained on. Once this internal\nstructure has been developed, the models can then take input in the form of\nnatural language and approximate a good response.\n\n##### If they‚Äôve been around for so many years, why are they just now making headlines?\n\nA few recent advancements have really brought the spotlight to generative AI\nand large language models:\n\n**A D VA N C E M E N T S I N T E C H N I Q U E S**\nOver the past few years, there have been significant advancements in the\ntechniques used to train these models, resulting in big leaps in performance.\nNotably, one of the largest jumps in performance has come from integrating\nhuman feedback directly into the training process.\n\n\n**I N C R E A S E D A C C E S S I B I L I T Y**\nThe release of ChatGPT opened the door for anyone with internet access\nto interact with one of the most advanced LLMs through a simple web\ninterface. This brought the impressive advancements of LLMs into the\nspotlight, since previously these more powerful LLMs were only available\nto researchers with large amounts of resources and those with very deep\ntechnical knowledge.\n\n**G R O W I N G C O M P U TAT I O N A L P O W E R**\nThe availability of more powerful computing resources, such as graphics\nprocessing units (GPUs), and better data processing techniques allowed\nresearchers to train much larger models, improving the performance of\nthese language models.\n\n**I M P R O V E D T R A I N I N G D ATA**\nAs we get better at collecting and analyzing large amounts of data, the\n\nmodel performance has improved dramatically. In fact, Databricks showed\nthat you can get amazing results training a relatively small model with a\nhigh-quality data set with [Dolly 2.0](https://huggingface.co/databricks/dolly-v2-12b) (and we released the data set as well\nwith the databricks-dolly-15k [data set](http://databricks/databricks-dolly-15k) ).\n\n\n-----\n\n##### So what are organizations using large language models for?\n\nHere are just a few examples of common use cases for large language models:\n\n**C H AT B O T S A N D V I R T U A L A S S I S TA N T S**\nOne of the most common implementations, LLMs can be used by\norganizations to provide help with things like customer support,\ntroubleshooting, or even having open-ended conversations with userprovided prompts.\n\n**C O D E G E N E R AT I O N A N D D E B U G G I N G**\nLLMs can be trained on large amounts of code examples and give\nuseful code snippets as a response to a request written in natural language.\nWith the proper techniques, LLMs can also be built in a way to reference\nother relevant data that it may not have been trained with, such as a\ncompany‚Äôs documentation, to help provide more accurate responses.\n\n**S E N T I M E N T A N A LY S I S**\nOften a hard task to quantify, LLMs can help take a piece of text and gauge\nemotion and opinions. This can help organizations gather the data and\n\nfeedback needed to improve customer satisfaction.\n\n\n**L A N G U A G E T R A N S L AT I O N**\nGlobalize all your content without hours of painstaking work by simply\nfeeding your web pages through the proper LLMs and translating them to\ndifferent languages. As more LLMs are trained in other languages, quality\nand availability will continue to improve.\n\n**S U M M A R I Z AT I O N A N D PA R A P H R A S I N G**\nEntire customer calls or meetings could be efficiently summarized so that\nothers can more easily digest the content. LLMs can take large amounts of\ntext and boil it down to just the most important bytes.\n\n**C O N T E N T G E N E R AT I O N**\nStart with a detailed prompt and have an LLM develop an outline for you.\nThen continue on with those prompts and LLMs can generate a good first\ndraft for you to build off. Use them to brainstorm ideas, and ask the LLM\nquestions to help you draw inspiration from.\n\n**_Note:_** Most LLMs are _not_ trained to be fact machines. They know how to use\nlanguage, but they might not know who won the big sporting event last year.\nIt‚Äôs always important to fact check and understand the responses before\n\nusing them as a reference.\n\n\n**T E X T C L A S S I F I C AT I O N A N D C L U S T E R I N G**\nThe ability to categorize and sort large volumes of data enables the\nidentification of common themes and trends, supporting informed\ndecision-making and more targeted strategies.\n\n\n-----\n\nSECTION 3\n## Applying Large Language Models\n\n\nThere are a few paths that one can take when looking to apply large language\nmodels for their given use case. Generally speaking, you can break them down\ninto two categories, but there‚Äôs some crossover between each. We‚Äôll briefly cover\nthe pros and cons of each and what scenarios fit best for each.\n\n##### Proprietary services\n\nAs the first widely available LLM powered service, OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT was the\nexplosive charge that brought LLMs into the mainstream. ChatGPT provides\na nice user interface (or API) where users can feed prompts to one of many\nmodels (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and more) and typically get a fast response. These are\namong the highest-performing models, trained on enormous data sets, and are\ncapable of extremely complex tasks both from a technical standpoint, such as\ncode generation, as well as from a creative perspective like writing poetry in a\nspecific style.\n\nThe downside of these services is the absolutely enormous amount of compute\nrequired not only to train them (OpenAI has said GPT-4 cost them over $100\nmillion to develop) but also to serve the responses. For this reason, these\nextremely large models will likely always be under the control of organizations,\n\n\nand require you to send your data to their servers in order to interact with their\nlanguage models. This raises privacy and security concerns, and also subjects\nusers to ‚Äúblack box‚Äù models, whose training and guardrails they have no control\nover. Also, due to the compute required, these services are not free beyond a\nvery limited use, so cost becomes a factor in applying these at scale.\n\nIn summary: Proprietary services are great to use if you have very complex tasks,\nare okay with sharing your data with a third party, and are prepared to incur\ncosts if operating at any significant scale.\n\n##### Open source models\n\nThe other avenue for language models is to go to the open source community,\nwhere there has been similarly explosive growth over the past few years.\nCommunities like [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) gather hundreds of thousands of models\n\nfrom contributors that can help solve tons of specific use cases such as text\ngeneration, summarization and classification. The open source community has\nbeen quickly catching up to the performance of the proprietary models, but\nultimately still hasn‚Äôt matched the performance of something like GPT-4.\n\n\n-----\n\nIt does currently take a little bit more work to grab an open source model and\nstart using it, but progress is moving very quickly to make them more accessible\nto users. On Databricks, for example, we‚Äôve made [improvements to open source](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/04/18/introducing-mlflow-23-enhanced-native-llm-support-and-new-features.html)\n[frameworks](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/04/18/introducing-mlflow-23-enhanced-native-llm-support-and-new-features.html) like MLflow to make it very easy for someone with a bit of Python\nexperience to pull any Hugging Face transformer model and use it as a Python\nobject. Oftentimes, you can find an open source model that solves your specific\nproblem that is **orders of magnitude** smaller than ChatGPT, allowing you to bring\nthe model into your environment and host it yourself. This means that you can\nkeep the data in your control for privacy and governance concerns as well as\nmanage your costs.\n\n\n##### Conclusion and general guidelines\n\nUltimately, every organization is going to have unique challenges to overcome,\nand there isn‚Äôt a one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to LLMs. As the world\nbecomes more data driven, everything, including LLMs, will be reliant on having\na strong foundation of data. LLMs are incredible tools, but they have to be used\nand implemented on top of this strong data foundation. Databricks brings both\nthat strong data foundation as well as the integrated tools to let you use and\nfine-tune LLMs in your domain.\n\n\nAnother huge upside to using open source models is the ability to fine-tune\nthem to your own data. Since you‚Äôre not dealing with a black box of a proprietary\nservice, there are techniques that let you take open source models and train\nthem to your specific data, greatly improving their performance on your\nspecific domain. We believe the future of language models is going to move\nin this direction, as more and more organizations will want full control and\nunderstanding of their LLMs.\n\n\n-----\n\nSECTION 4\n## So What Do I Do Next If I Want to Start Using LLMs?\n\n\nThat depends where you are on your journey! Fortunately, we have a few paths\nfor you.\n\nIf you want to go a little deeper into LLMs but aren‚Äôt quite ready to do it yourself,\nyou can watch one of Databricks‚Äô most talented developers and speakers go\nover these concepts in more detail during the on-demand talk ‚Äú [How to Build](https://www.databricks.com/resources/webinar/build-your-own-large-language-model-dolly)\n[Your Own Large Language Model Like Dolly.](https://www.databricks.com/resources/webinar/build-your-own-large-language-model-dolly) ‚Äù\n\nIf you‚Äôre ready to dive a little deeper and expand your education and\nunderstanding of LLM foundations, we‚Äôd recommend checking out our\n[course on LLMs](https://www.edx.org/course/large-language-models-application-through-production) .

This is further driving the need\n\nfor strong data engineering practices.\n\n**Regulation** ‚Äî With the growth of data generation and data collection,\n\nthere is increased interest in how the data is protected and managed.\n\nRegulatory regimes such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)\n\nfrom the EU and other jurisdictions mandate very specific ways in which\n\ndata must be managed.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Drivers\n\n**Technology Innovation** ‚Äî The move to cloud-based analytics architectures\n\nthat is now well underway is being propelled further by innovations such as\n\nanalytics-focused chipsets, pipeline automation and the unification of data\n\nand machine learning. All these offer data professionals new approaches for\n\ntheir data initiatives.\n\n**Financial Scrutiny** ‚Äî With a growth in investment, analytics initiatives are\n\nalso subject to increasing scrutiny. There is also a greater understanding of\n\ndata as a valuable asset. Deriving value from data must be done in a manner\n\nthat is financially responsible and actually value adding to the enterprise and\n\nmeeting ROI hurdles.\n\n**Role Evolution** ‚Äî Reflecting the importance of managing the data and\n\nmaximizing value extraction, the Chief Data Officer (CDO) role is becoming\n\nmore prominent and newer roles such as Data Curator are emerging.\n\nThey must balance the needs of governance, security and democratization.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Key Goals\n\n#### Data Pipeline Key Goals\n\nMaking quality data available in a reliable manner is a major determinant of success for data\n\nanalytics initiatives be they regular dashboards or reports, or advanced analytics projects\n\ndrawing on state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Data engineers tasked with this\n\nresponsibility need to take account of a broad set of dependencies and requirements as they\n\ndesign and build their data pipelines.\n\nThree primary goals that data engineers typically seek to address as they work to enable the\n\nanalytics professionals in their organizations are:\n\n**Deliver quality data in less time** ‚Äî When it comes to data, quality and timeliness\n\nare key. Data with gaps or errors (which can arise for many reasons) is\n\n‚Äúunreliable,‚Äù can lead to wrong conclusions, and is of limited value to downstream\n\nusers. Equally well, many applications require up-to-date information (who\n\nwants to use last night‚Äôs closing stock price or weather forecast) and are of\n\nlimited value without it.\n\n**Enable faster queries** ‚Äî Wanting fast responses to queries is natural enough\n\nin today‚Äôs ‚ÄúNew York minute,‚Äù online world. Achieving this is particularly\n\ndemanding when the queries are based on very large data sets.\n\n**Simplify data engineering at scale** ‚Äî It is one thing to have high reliability and\n\nperformance in a limited, development or test environment. What matters\n\nmore is the ability to have robust, production data pipelines at scale without\n\nrequiring high operational overhead.\n\n\n-----\n\n### ‚Ñ¢\n## Apache Spark\n\n#### Apache Spark ‚Ñ¢ : The First Unified Analytics Engine\n\nOriginally developed at UC Berkeley in 2009, Apache Spark can be\n\nconsidered the first unified analytics engine. Uniquely bringing data\n\n\nand AI technologies together, Spark comes packaged with higher-level\n\nlibraries, including support for SQL queries, streaming data, machine\n\nlearning and graph processing. These standard libraries increase\n\ndeveloper productivity and can be seamlessly combined to create\n\n\nCustomer\nData\n\nEmails/\nWeb Pages\n\n\nClick\nStreams\n\nVideo/\nSpeech\n\n...\n\nSensor\nData (IoT)\n\n\ncomplex workflows.\n\n\n#### Big Data Processing\n\n\n#### Machine Learning\n\n\nSince its release, Apache Spark, has seen rapid adoption by\n\nenterprises across a wide range of industries. Internet powerhouses\n\n\nETL + SQL + Streaming MLlib + SparkR\n\n\nsuch as Netflix, Yahoo and eBay have deployed Spark at massive scale,\n\n\ncollectively processing multiple petabytes of data on clusters of over\n\n8,000 nodes making it the de facto choice for new analytics initiatives.\n\nIt has quickly become the largest open source community in big data,\n\nwith over 1000 contributors from 250+ organizations.\n\n\n##### While Spark has had a significant impact in taking data analytics to the next level, practitioners continue to face data reliability and performance challenges with their data lakes.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Data Reliability Challenges With Data Lakes\n\n\n**Failed Writes** ‚Äî If a production job that is writing data experiences failures which\n\nare inevitable in large distributed environments, it can result in data corruption\n\nthrough partial or multiple writes. What is needed is a mechanism that is able to\n\nensure that either a write takes place completely or not at all (and not multiple times,\n\nadding spurious data). Failed jobs can impose a considerable burden to recover\n\nto a clean state.\n\n\n**Schema Mismatch** ‚Äî When ingesting content from multiple sources, typical of\n\nlarge, modern big data environments, it can be difficult to ensure that the same\n\ndata is encoded in the same way i.e., the schema matches. A similar challenge\n\narises when the formats for data elements are changed without informing the\n\ndata engineering team. Both can result in low quality, inconsistent data that\n\nrequires cleaning up to improve its usability. The ability to observe and enforce\n\nschema would serve to mitigate this.\n\n\n**Lack of Consistency** ‚Äî In a complex big data environment, one may be interested\n\nin considering a mix of both batch and streaming data. Trying to read data while\n\nit is being appended to provides a challenge since on the one hand there is a\n\ndesire to keep ingesting new data while on the other hand anyone reading the\n\ndata prefers a consistent view. This is especially an issue when there are multiple\n\nreaders and writers at work. It is undesirable and impractical, of course, to\n\nstop read access while writes complete or stop write access while reads are\n\nin progress.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Delta Lake: A New Storage Layer\n\n[Delta Lake](https://delta.io/) is an open source storage layer that brings reliability to data lakes. Delta Lake provides ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and unifies\n\nstreaming and batch data processing. Delta Lake runs on top of your existing data lake and is fully compatible with Apache Spark APIs. Raw data is ingested\n\nfrom various batch and streaming input sources. Simple, reliable data pipelines help create a curated data lake containing tables of differing degrees of\n\nrefinement based on business needs. The data in these tables is then made available via the standard Spark APIs or special connectors for various use cases\n\nsuch as machine learning, SQL analytics or feeding to a data warehouse.\n\nStreaming\n\n###### Analytics and Machine Learning\n\n\nBatch\n\n\nIngestion Tables Refined Tables\n(Bronze) (Silver)\n\n\nFeature/Agg Data Store\n(Gold)\n\n\n###### Your Existing Data Lake\n\n\n-----\n\n## Delta Lake: Key Features\n\n\n**ACID Transactions ‚Äî** Data lakes typically have multiple data pipelines reading\n\nand writing data concurrently, and data engineers have to go through a tedious\n\nprocess to ensure data integrity, due to the lack of transactions. Delta Lake\n\nbrings ACID transactions to your data lakes. It provides serializability, the\n\n\n**Scalable Metadata Handling ‚Äî** In big data, even the metadata itself can be ‚Äúbig\n\ndata.‚Äù Delta Lake treats metadata just like data, leveraging Spark‚Äôs distributed\n\nprocessing power to handle all its metadata. As a result, Delta Lake can handle\n\npetabyte-scale tables with billions of partitions and files at ease.\n\n\nstrongest level of isolation level.\n\n\n**Time Travel (data versioning) ‚Äî** Delta Lake provides snapshots of data enabling\n\ndevelopers to access and revert to earlier versions of data for audits, rollbacks or\n\nto reproduce experiments. For further details, please see this [documentation](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-batch.html%23-deltatimetravel&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1666305658154469&usg=AOvVaw0Zh1svr9wsqkIDKGQTgtLh) .\n\n\n**Schema Enforcement ‚Äî** Delta Lake provides the ability to specify your schema\n\nand enforce it. This helps ensure that the data types are correct and required\n\ncolumns are present, preventing bad data from causing data corruption.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Delta Lake: Key Features\n\nParquet\n\n\n**Open Format ‚Äî** All data in Delta Lake is stored in Apache Parquet format,\n\nenabling Delta Lake to leverage the efficient compression and encoding schemes\n\nthat are native to Parquet.\n\n**Unified Batch and Streaming Source and Sink** ‚Äî A table in Delta Lake is both a\n\nbatch table, as well as a streaming source and sink. Streaming data ingest, batch\n\nhistoric backfill, and interactive queries all just work out of the box.\n\n\n**Schema Evolution ‚Äî** Big data is continuously changing. Delta Lake\n\nenables you to make changes to a table schema that can be applied\n\nautomatically, without the need for cumbersome DDL.\n\n**100% Compatible With Apache Spark API ‚Äî** Developers can use Delta\n\nLake with their existing data pipelines with minimal change as it is fully\n\ncompatible with Spark, the commonly used big data processing engine.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Getting Started With Delta Lake\n\n**Getting started with Delta Lake is easy. Specifically, to create a Delta table simply specify Delta instead of using Parquet.**\n\n\n#### Instead of parquet ...\n```\ndataframe\n.write\n.format(‚Äú parquet ‚Äù)\n.save(‚Äú/data‚Äù)\n\n```\n\n#### ‚Ä¶ simply say delta\n```\ndataframe\n.write\n.format(‚Äú delta ‚Äù)\n.save(‚Äú/data‚Äù)\n\n```\n\n##### Learn more about Delta Lake :\n\n[Delta Lake Blogs](https://delta.io/blog)\n\nDelta Lake Tutorials\n\n[Delta Lake Integrations](https://delta.io/integrations/)\n\n**For more information, please refer to the** **[documentation](https://docs.delta.io/latest/index.html)** **.**\n\n\n-----",

Through a CDP, data\nfrom every touch point, along with third-party information, is brought together to provide\na unified view of the customer. This enables your marketing team to analyze, identify and\nactivate customers with targeted content.\n\nThe key question for all IT teams at these organizations is whether to build or to buy.\n\nA CDP that sounds like music to the ears of business leaders may be perceived as noise\nby enterprise IT leaders. The business side of the house needs immediate enablement, and\nan out-of-the-box system dedicated to the specialized needs of marketers seems like the\nfastest path to a solution.\n\nBut for IT, the CDP is yet another system, bringing stack baggage and redundancies to\nexisting marketing and analytics systems.. The cost of adding another system to the\nlandscape and the redundancy of sensitive customer data creates a governance challenge\nthat has immediate consequences.\n\n**Critical IT Needs** **Critical Business Needs**\n\n\nKeep control of data access and\ngovernance; ability to architecture a\ncustomer data stack with decisions on\nwhere data is stored and where queries\nare executed\n\n\nGet customer data access via a no-code\ninterface to generate insights; build customer\nexperiences and activate data within\nbusiness applications\n\n\n-----\n\nThe question of whether to build or buy seems to leave legitimate needs and concerns by one\nside or the other unaddressed ‚Äî which is why so many organizations who have built a CDP\nhave expressed dissatisfaction regardless of which side of the fence they came down upon.\n\n**At both ActionIQ and Databricks, we believe the best path forward is to acknowledge**\n**both sides of the debate and provide organizations a third choice of both building and**\n**buying.** The ActionIQ customer data platform built on the Databricks Lakehouse provides\nthe business with no-code and ease of use interface along with the flexibility and centralized\ngovernance IT desires. By shifting the conversation from building or buying to building _and_\nbuying, we‚Äôve opened the door to finding the right balance of approaches for our customer\norganizations, helping organizations find greater success in their personalization journey.\n\n**‚ÄúWe made an attempt to internally build a CDP platform and while we**\n**could do basic SQL,** **[audience segmentation](https://www.actioniq.com/solutions/audience-segmentation/)** **and activation across multiple**\n**channels, by no means were we able to orchestrate an** **[omnichannel journey](https://www.actioniq.com/blog/omnichannel-customer-journey/)**\n**or offer a campaign interface to our product marketers that could empower**\n**them to create and manage those journeys. It was going to take at least two**\n**years for us to build all of that functionality in house.‚Äù**\n\n‚Äì Sravan Gupta, Senior Manager of GTM Systems, Atlassian\n\n\n-----\n\n## Combining the Build and Buy Approaches\n\n\nBringing together the best of build and buy involves the deployment of the CDP alongside or\nwithin the lakehouse platform. There are three approaches to this:\n\n**Bundled** **Composable**\n\n**1. Bundled** **2. Hybrid** **3. Lakehouse-Only**\n\n\nCompute\n\nStorage\n\n\nCompute\n\nStorage\n(Local & Views)\n\n\nQuery\nVirtualization\n\nMetadata\n\n\nData Copy\n\n\nLakehouse\n\nStorage\n\n\nLakehouse\n\n\nLakehouse\n\n\nCompute Compute\n\nStorage Storage\n\n\n-----\n\nDeployment Type\n\n**Bundled**\n\n**Composable ‚Äì**\n**Hybrid**\n\n**Composable ‚Äì**\n**Lakehouse-Only**\n\n\nDescription\n\nThe CDP and the lakehouse are managed as two separate systems. Connectors in either system (as well as\nthird-party tools) allow data to be exchanged, typically as part of an ad hoc or batch process. This approach\nallows the organization to leverage the functionality of both systems but data is duplicated making governance\nan on-going concern.\n\nThe CDP and the lakehouse are managed as two separate systems, but deeper integrations between the two\nallow the organization to decide within which system a specific dataset should reside. Real-time integrations\nbetween the systems allow CDP users to select information assets in the lakehouse and generate queries\nspanning data on either side of the platform divide. This approach minimizes the need for data duplication\nwhich simplifies data governance, even though it must be implemented within two separate systems.\n\nAll CDP information assets reside within the lakehouse. User interfaces built on other technologies, directly\ninteract with the lakehouse for access to data. This approach minimizes redundancy and allows organizations\nto implement a centralized data governance strategy for all consumers of customer-relevant data.\n\n\n-----\n\n## Deployment Architectures \n\n\nThe choice of which of these deployment architectures is best depends on the functional\nrequirements of a specific organization. Each has its benefits, and in the case of parallel\nand federated deployments, organizations can easily transition between deployment\narchitectures over time.

       "\n",
       "This is the number one mistake customers make. Many customers create tiny\n",

       "The key is that you‚Äôre renting the cluster for the length of the workload. So, if\n",

       "workers for the full hour. However, if you spin up a four worker cluster and it takes\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",

       "Parquet or Delta. So joins? Yep! Aggregations? Sure! ETL? Absolutely! That UDF\n",

           "**Challenges with data lakes**\nData lakes are a common element within modern data architectures. They serve as a\ncentral ingestion point for the plethora of data that organizations seek to gather and\nmine. While a good step forward in getting to grips with the range of data, they run\ninto the following common problems:\n\n**1. Reading and writing into data lakes is not reliable.** Data engineers often run into\nthe problem of unsafe writes into data lakes that cause readers to see garbage\ndata during writes. They have to build workarounds to ensure readers always see\nconsistent data during writes.\n\n**2. The data quality in data lakes is low.** Dumping unstructured data into a data\nlake is easy, but this comes at the cost of data quality. Without any mechanisms\nfor validating schema and the data, data lakes suffer from poor data quality. As a\nconsequence, analytics projects that strive to mine this data also fail.\n\n**3. Poor performance with increasing amounts of data.** As the amount of data\nthat gets dumped into a data lake increases, the number of files and directories\nalso increases. Big data jobs and query engines that process the data spend a\nsignificant amount of time handling the metadata operations. This problem is more\npronounced in the case of streaming jobs or handling many concurrent batch jobs.\n\n**4. Modifying, updating or deleting records in data lakes is hard.** Engineers need to\nbuild complicated pipelines to read entire partitions or tables, modify the data and\nwrite them back. Such pipelines are inefficient and hard to maintain.",

However,\naccessing and managing data for these initiatives has become increasingly\ncomplex. Most of the complexity has arisen with the explosion of data volumes\nand data types, with organizations amassing an estimated [80% of data in](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/01/29/the-80-blind-spot-are-you-ignoring-unstructured-organizational-data/?sh=681651dc211c)\n[unstructured and semi-structured format](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/01/29/the-80-blind-spot-are-you-ignoring-unstructured-organizational-data/?sh=681651dc211c) . As the collection of data continues\nto increase, 73% of the data goes unused for analytics or decision-making. In\norder to try and decrease this percentage and make more data usable, data\nengineering teams are responsible for building data pipelines to efficiently and\nreliably deliver data. But the process of building these complex data pipelines\ncomes with a number of difficulties:\n\n**‚Ä¢** In order to get data into a data lake, data engineers are required\nto spend immense time hand-coding repetitive data ingestion tasks\n\n**‚Ä¢** Since data platforms continuously change, data engineers\nspend time building and maintaining, and then rebuilding, complex\nscalable infrastructure\n\n**‚Ä¢** As data pipelines become more complex, data engineers are\nrequired to find reliable tools to orchestrate these pipelines\n\n**‚Ä¢** With the increasing importance of real-time data, low latency data\npipelines are required, which are even more difficult to build and maintain\n\n**‚Ä¢** Finally, with all pipelines written, data engineers need to constantly\nfocus on performance, tuning pipelines and architectures to meet SLAs\n\n\n**How can Databricks help?**\n\nWith the Databricks Lakehouse Platform, data engineers have access to an\nend-to-end data engineering solution for ingesting, transforming, processing,\nscheduling and delivering data.

From data ingestion\nand real-time processing to analytics and machine learning, you‚Äôll learn\nhow to translate raw data into actionable data.\n\nAs you explore the rest of this guide, you can find data sets and code\nsamples in the various **[Databricks Solution Accelerators](https://www.databricks.com/solutions/accelerators)** , so you can\nget your hands dirty as you explore all aspects of the data lifecycle on the\nDatabricks Lakehouse Platform.\n\n**Start experimenting with these**\n**free Databricks** **notebooks** **.**\n\n\n-----\n\n**SECTION**\n\n# 02\n\n\n### Guidance and Best Practices\n\n**2.1** Top 5 Databricks Performance Tips\n\n**2.2** How to Profile PySpark\n\n**2.3** Low-Latency Streaming Data Pipelines With Delta Live Tables and Apache Kafka\n\n**2.4** Streaming in Production: Collected Best Practices\n\n**2.5** Streaming in Production: Collected Best Practices, Part 2\n\n**2.6** Building Geospatial Data Products\n\n**2.7** Data Lineage With Unity Catalog\n\n**2.8** Easy Ingestion to Lakehouse With COPY INTO\n\n**2.9** Simplifying Change Data Capture With Databricks Delta Live Tables\n\n**2.10** Best Practices for Cross-Government Data Sharing\n\n\n-----\n\nSECTION 2.1\n\n**Top 5 Databricks Performance Tips**\n\nby **B R YA N S M I T H** and **R O B S A K E R**\n\nMarch 10, 2022\n\n\nAs solutions architects, we work closely with customers every day to help them\nget the best performance out of their jobs on Databricks ‚Äî and we often end\nup giving the same advice. It‚Äôs not uncommon to have a conversation with a\ncustomer and get double, triple, or even more performance with just a few\ntweaks. So what‚Äôs the secret? How are we doing this? Here are the top 5 things\nwe see that can make a huge impact on the performance customers get\nfrom Databricks.\n\nHere‚Äôs a TLDR:\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Use larger clusters.** It may sound obvious, but this is the number\none problem we see. It‚Äôs actually not any more expensive to use a large\ncluster for a workload than it is to use a smaller one. It‚Äôs just faster.\nIf there‚Äôs anything you should take away from this article, it‚Äôs this.\n\nRead section 1. Really.\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Use** **[Photon](https://databricks.com/blog/2021/06/17/announcing-photon-public-preview-the-next-generation-query-engine-on-the-databricks-lakehouse-platform.html?itm_data=product-cta-announcingPhotonBlog)** , Databricks‚Äô new, super-fast execution engine. Read section 2\nto learn more. You won‚Äôt regret it.\n\n\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Clean out your configurations** . Configurations carried from one\nApache Spark‚Ñ¢ version to the next can cause massive problems. Clean up!\nRead section 3 to learn more.\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Use** **[Delta Caching](https://docs.databricks.com/delta/optimizations/delta-cache.html)** . There‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôre not using caching\ncorrectly, if at all. See Section 4 to learn more.\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Be aware of lazy evaluation** . If this doesn‚Äôt mean anything to you and\nyou‚Äôre writing Spark code, jump to section 5.\n\n**‚Ä¢** **Bonus tip! Table design is super important** . We‚Äôll go into this in a future\nblog, but for now, check out the [guide on Delta Lake best practices](https://docs.databricks.com/delta/best-practices.html) .\n\n**1. Give your clusters horsepower!**\n\nThis is the number one mistake customers make. Many customers create tiny\nclusters of two workers with four cores each, and it takes forever to do anything.\nThe concern is always the same: they don‚Äôt want to spend too much money on\nlarger clusters. Here‚Äôs the thing: **it‚Äôs actually not any more expensive to use a**\n**large cluster for a workload than it is to use a smaller one. It‚Äôs just faster.**\n\n\n-----\n\nThe key is that you‚Äôre renting the cluster for the length of the workload. So, if\nyou spin up that two worker cluster and it takes an hour, you‚Äôre paying for those\nworkers for the full hour. However, if you spin up a four worker cluster and it takes\nonly half an hour, the cost is actually the same! And that trend continues as long\nas there‚Äôs enough work for the cluster to do.\n\nHere‚Äôs a hypothetical scenario illustrating the point:\n\n**Number of Workers** **Cost Per Hour** **Length of Workload (hours)** **Cost of Workload**\n\n1 $1 2 $2\n\n2 $2 1 $2\n\n4 $4 0.5 $2\n\n8 $8 0.25 $2\n\nNotice that the total cost of the workload stays the same while the real-world\ntime it takes for the job to run drops significantly. So, bump up your Databricks\ncluster specs and speed up your workloads without spending any more money. It\n\ncan‚Äôt really get any simpler than that.\n\n**2. Use Photon**\n\nOur colleagues in engineering have rewritten the Spark execution engine in C++\nand dubbed it Photon. The results are impressive!\n\n\nBeyond the obvious improvements due to running the engine in native code,\nthey‚Äôve also made use of CPU-level performance features and better memory\n\nmanagement. On top of this, they‚Äôve rewritten the Parquet writer in C++. So this\nmakes writing to Parquet and Delta (based on Parquet) super fast as well!\n\nBut let‚Äôs also be clear about what Photon is speeding up. It improves\ncomputation speed for any built-in functions or operations, as well as writes to\nParquet or Delta. So joins? Yep! Aggregations? Sure! ETL? Absolutely! That UDF\n(user-defined function) you wrote? Sorry, but it won‚Äôt help there. The job that‚Äôs\nspending most of its time reading from an ancient on-prem database? Won‚Äôt\nhelp there either, unfortunately.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe good news is that it helps where it can. So even if part of your job can‚Äôt be\nsped up, it will speed up the other parts. Also, most jobs are written with the\nnative operations and spend a lot of time writing to Delta, and Photon helps a lot\nthere. So give it a try. You may be amazed by the results!\n\n**3. Clean out old configurations**\n\nYou know those Spark configurations you‚Äôve been carrying along from version to\nversion and no one knows what they do anymore? They may not be harmless.\nWe‚Äôve seen jobs go from running for hours down to minutes simply by cleaning\nout old configurations. There may have been a quirk in a particular version of\nSpark, a performance tweak that has not aged well, or something pulled off\nsome blog somewhere that never really made sense. At the very least, it‚Äôs worth\nrevisiting your Spark configurations if you‚Äôre in this situation. Often the default\nconfigurations are the best, and they‚Äôre only getting better. Your configurations\nmay be holding you back.\n\n**4. The Delta Cache is your friend**\n\nThis may seem obvious, but you‚Äôd be surprised how many people are not using\nthe [Delta Cache](https://docs.databricks.com/delta/optimizations/delta-cache.html) , which loads data off of cloud storage (S3, ADLS) and keeps it on\nthe workers‚Äô SSDs for faster access.\n\n\nIf you‚Äôre using Databricks SQL Endpoints you‚Äôre in luck. Those have caching on\nby default. In fact, we recommend using [CACHE SELECT * FROM table](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/spark-sql/language-manual/delta-cache.html) to preload\nyour ‚Äúhot‚Äù tables when you‚Äôre starting an endpoint. This will ensure blazing fast\nspeeds for any queries on those tables.\n\nIf you‚Äôre using regular clusters, be sure to use the i3 series on Amazon Web\nServices (AWS), L series or E series on Azure Databricks, or n2 in GCP. These will\nall have fast SSDs and caching enabled by default.\n\nOf course, your mileage may vary. If you‚Äôre doing BI, which involves reading the\nsame tables over and over again, caching gives an amazing boost. However, if\nyou‚Äôre simply reading a table once and writing out the results as in some ETL\njobs, you may not get much benefit. You know your jobs better than anyone.\nGo forth and conquer.\n\n\n-----\n\n**5. Be aware of lazy evaluation**\n\n\nHowever, there is a catch here. Every time you try to display or write out\nresults, it runs the execution plan again. Let‚Äôs look at the same block of code\nbut extend it and do a few more operations.\n\n‚Äî-------\n_# Build an execution plan._\n_# This returns in less than a second but does no work_\ndf2 = (df\n.join(...)\n.select(...)\n.filter(...)\n)\n\n_# Now run the execution plan to get results_\ndf2.display()\n\n_# Unfortunately this will run the plan again, including filtering, joining,_\n_etc_\ndf2.display()\n\n_# So will this‚Ä¶_\ndf2.count()\n‚Äî------\n\n\nIf you‚Äôre a data analyst or data scientist only using SQL or doing BI you can skip\nthis section. However, if you‚Äôre in data engineering and writing pipelines or doing\nprocessing using Databricks/Spark, read on.\n\nWhen you‚Äôre writing Spark code like select, groupBy, filter, etc., you‚Äôre really\nbuilding an execution plan. You‚Äôll notice the code returns almost immediately when\nyou run these functions. That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not actually doing any computation. So\neven if you have petabytes of data, it will return in less than a second.\n\nHowever, once you go to write your results out you‚Äôll notice it takes longer. This\nis due to lazy evaluation. It‚Äôs not until you try to display or write results that your\nexecution plan is actually run.\n\n‚Äî-------\n_# Build an execution plan._\n_# This returns in less than a second but does no work_\ndf2 = (df\n.join(...)\n.select(...)\n. filter (...)\n\n\n_# Now run the execution plan to get results_\ndf2.display()\n‚Äî------\n\n\n-----\n\nThe developer of this code may very well be thinking that they‚Äôre just printing\nout results three times, but what they‚Äôre really doing is kicking off the same\nprocessing three times. Oops. That‚Äôs a lot of extra work. This is a very common\nmistake we run into. So why is there lazy evaluation, and what do we do about it?\n\nIn short, processing with lazy evaluation is way faster than without it.\nDatabricks/Spark looks at the full execution plan and finds opportunities\nfor optimization that can reduce processing time by orders of magnitude.\nSo that‚Äôs great, but how do we avoid the extra computation? The answer\nis pretty straightforward: save computed results you will reuse.\n\n\nThis works especially well when [Delta Caching](https://docs.databricks.com/delta/optimizations/delta-cache.html) is turned on. In short, you\nbenefit greatly from lazy evaluation, but it‚Äôs something a lot of customers trip\nover. So be aware of its existence and save results you reuse in order to avoid\nunnecessary computation.\n\n**Start experimenting with these**\n**free Databricks** **notebooks** **.**\n\n\nLet‚Äôs look at the same block of code again, but this time let‚Äôs avoid the\nrecomputation:\n\n_# Build an execution plan._\n_# This returns in less than a second but does no work_\ndf2 = (df\n.join(...)\n.select(...)\n. filter (...)\n)\n\n_# save it_\ndf2.write.save(path)\n\n_# load it back in_\ndf3 = spark.read.load(path)\n\n_# now use it_\ndf3.display()\n\n_# this is not doing any extra computation anymore. No joins, filtering,_\n_etc. It‚Äôs already done and saved._\ndf3.display()\n\n_# nor is this_\ndf3.count()\n\n\n-----\n\nSECTION 2.2 \u0007\n\n**How to Profile PySpark**\n\nby **X I N R O N G M E N G , TA K U YA U E S H I N , H Y U K J I N K W O N** and **A L L A N F O LT I N G**\n\nOctober 6, 2022\n\n\nIn Apache Spark‚Ñ¢, declarative Python APIs are supported for big data workloads.\nThey are powerful enough to handle most common use cases. Furthermore,\nPySpark UDFs offer more flexibility since they enable users to run arbitrary\nPython code on top of the Apache Spark‚Ñ¢ engine. Users only have to state\n‚Äúwhat to do‚Äù; PySpark, as a sandbox, encapsulates ‚Äúhow to do it.‚Äù That makes\nPySpark easier to use, but it can be difficult to identify performance bottlenecks\nand apply custom optimizations.\n\nTo address the difficulty mentioned above, PySpark supports various profiling\ntools, which are all based on [cProfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#module-cProfile) , one of the standard Python [profiler](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html)\n[implementations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html) . PySpark Profilers provide information such as the number\nof function calls, total time spent in the given function, and filename, as well\nas line number to help navigation. That information is essential to exposing\ntight loops in your PySpark programs, and allowing you to make performance\n\nimprovement decisions.\n\n\n**Driver profiling**\n\nPySpark applications run as independent sets of processes on a cluster,\ncoordinated by the SparkContext object in the driver program. On the driver\nside, PySpark is a regular Python process; thus, we can profile it as a normal\nPython program using cProfile as illustrated below:\n\nimport cProfile\n\nwith cProfile.Profile() as pr:\n_# Your code_\n\npr.print_stats()\n\n**Workers profiling**\n\nExecutors are distributed on worker nodes in the cluster, which introduces\ncomplexity because we need to aggregate profiles. Furthermore, a Python worker\nprocess is spawned per executor for PySpark UDF execution, which makes the\nprofiling more intricate.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe UDF profiler, which is introduced in Spark 3.3, overcomes all those obstacles\nand becomes a major tool to profile workers for PySpark applications. We‚Äôll\nillustrate how to use the UDF profiler with a simple Pandas UDF example.\n\nFirstly, a PySpark DataFrame with 8,000 rows is generated, as shown below.\n```\n sdf = spark.range( 0 , 8 * 1000 ).withColumn(\n  'id' , (col( 'id' ) % 8 ). cast ( 'integer' ) # 1000 rows x 8 groups (if group\n by 'id' )\n ).withColumn( 'v' , rand())\n\n```\nLater, we will group by the id column, which results in 8 groups with 1,000 rows\nper group.\n\nThe Pandas UDF plus_one is then created and applied as shown below:\n```\n import pandas as pd\n def plus_one ( pdf: pd.DataFrame ) -> pd.DataFrame:\n   return pdf.apply( lambda x: x + 1 , axis= 1 )\n res = sdf.groupby( \"id\" ).applyInPandas(plus_one, schema=sdf.schema)\n res.collect()\n\n```\n\nExecuting the example above and running sc.show_profiles() prints the\nfollowing profile. The profile below can also be dumped to disk by sc.dump_\nprofiles(path).\n\nThe UDF id in the profile (271, highlighted above) matches that in the Spark plan\nfor res. The Spark plan can be shown by calling res.explain() .\n\n\nNote that plus_one takes a pandas DataFrame and returns another pandas\nDataFrame. For each group, all columns are passed together as a pandas\nDataFrame to the plus_one UDF, and the returned pandas DataFrames are\ncombined into a PySpark DataFrame.\n\n\n-----\n\nThe first line in the profile‚Äôs body indicates the total number of calls that were\nmonitored. The column heading includes\n\n**‚Ä¢** ncalls , for the number of calls.\n\n**‚Ä¢** tottime , for the total time spent in the given function (excluding time\nspent in calls to sub-functions)\n\n**‚Ä¢** percall , the quotient of tottime divided by ncalls\n\n**‚Ä¢** cumtime , the cumulative time spent in this and all subfunctions (from\ninvocation till exit)\n\n**‚Ä¢** percall , the quotient of cumtime divided by primitive calls\n\n**‚Ä¢** filename:lineno(function) , which provides the respective information\nfor each function\n\nDigging into the column details: plus_one is triggered once per group, 8 times\nin total; _arith_method of pandas Series is called once per row, 8,000 times\nin total. pandas.DataFrame.apply applies the function lambda x: x + 1 row by\nrow, thus suffering from high invocation overhead.\n\nWe can reduce such overhead by substituting the pandas.DataFrame.apply\nwith pdf + 1, which is vectorized in pandas. The optimized Pandas UDF looks as\nfollows:\n```\n import pandas as pd\n def plus_one_optimized ( pdf: pd.DataFrame ) -> pd.DataFrame:\n   return pdf + 1\n res = sdf.groupby( \"id\" ).applyInPandas(plus_one_optimized, schema=sdf.\n schema)\n res.collect()\n\n```\n\nThe updated profile is as shown below.\n\nWe can summarize the optimizations as follows:\n\n**‚Ä¢** Arithmetic operation from 8,000 calls to 8 calls\n\n**‚Ä¢** Total function calls from 2,898,160 calls to 2,384 calls\n\n**‚Ä¢** Total execution time from 2.300 seconds to 0.004 seconds\n\nThe short example above demonstrates how the UDF profiler helps us deeply\nunderstand the execution, identify the performance bottleneck and enhance\nthe overall performance of the user-defined function.\n\nThe UDF profiler was implemented based on the executor-side profiler,\nwhich is designed for PySpark RDD API. The executor-side profiler is available\nin all active Databricks Runtime versions.\n\n\n-----\n\nBoth the UDF profiler and the executor-side profiler run on Python workers.\nThey are controlled by the spark.python.profile Spark configuration, which\nis false by default. We can enable that Spark configuration on a Databricks\nRuntime cluster as shown below.\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nPySpark profilers are implemented based on cProfile; thus, the profile reporting\nrelies on the [Stats](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#the-stats-class) class. [Spark Accumulators](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html#accumulators) also play an important role when\ncollecting profile reports from Python workers.\n\nPowerful profilers are provided by PySpark in order to identify hot loops and\nsuggest potential improvements. They are easy to use and critical to enhance\nthe performance of PySpark programs. The UDF profiler, which is available\nstarting from Databricks Runtime 11.0 (Spark 3.3), overcomes all the technical\nchallenges and brings insights to user-defined functions.\n\nIn addition, there is an ongoing effort in the Apache Spark‚Ñ¢ open source\ncommunity to introduce memory profiling on executors; see [SPARK-40281](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-40281) for\nmore information.\n\n**Start experimenting with these**\n**free Databricks** **notebooks** **.**\n\n\n-----\n\nSECTION 2.3 \u0007\n\n**Low-Latency Streaming Data Pipelines With Delta Live Tables**\n**and Apache Kafka**\n\nby **F R A N K M U N Z**\n\nAugust 9, 2022\n\n\n[Delta Live Tables (DLT)](https://databricks.com/product/delta-live-tables) is the first ETL framework that uses a simple declarative\napproach for creating reliable data pipelines and fully manages the underlying\ninfrastructure at scale for batch and [streaming data](https://www.databricks.com/product/data-streaming) . Many use cases require\nactionable insights derived from near real-time data. Delta Live Tables enables\nlow-latency streaming data pipelines to support such use cases with low\nlatencies by directly ingesting data from event buses like [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) , [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/)\n[Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/) , [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud) , [Amazon MSK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtU9pb18g5Q) , or [Azure Event Hubs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/) .\n\nThis article will walk through using DLT with Apache Kafka while providing the\nrequired Python code to ingest streams. The recommended system architecture\nwill be explained, and related DLT settings worth considering will be explored\nalong the way.\n\n**Streaming platforms**\n\nEvent buses or message buses decouple message producers from consumers.\nA popular streaming use case is the collection of click-through data from\nusers navigating a website where every user interaction is stored as an event in\n\n\nApache Kafka. The event stream from Kafka is then used for real-time streaming\ndata analytics. Multiple message consumers can read the same data from Kafka\nand use the data to learn about audience interests, conversion rates, and bounce\nreasons. The real-time, streaming event data from the user interactions often\nalso needs to be correlated with actual purchases stored in a billing database.\n\n**Apache Kafka**\n\n[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is a popular open source event bus. Kafka uses the concept of a\ntopic, an append-only distributed log of events where messages are buffered for\na certain amount of time. Although messages in Kafka are not deleted once they\nare consumed, they are also not stored indefinitely. The message retention for\n\nKafka can be configured per topic and defaults to 7 days. Expired messages will\nbe deleted eventually.\n\nThis article is centered around Apache Kafka; however, the concepts discussed\nalso apply to many other event busses or messaging systems.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Streaming data pipelines**\n\n\nIn a data flow pipeline, Delta Live Tables and their dependencies can be declared\nwith a standard SQL Create Table As Select (CTAS) statement and the DLT\nkeyword ‚Äúlive.‚Äù\n\nWhen developing DLT with Python, the @dlt.table decorator is used to",

Read the entire guide or dive straight into a\nspecific challenge.\n\nWith the advent of cloud infrastructure, a new generation of\nstartups has rapidly built and scaled their businesses. The use of\ncloud infrastructure, once seen as innovative, has now become\ntable stakes. The differentiator for the fastest-moving startups\nand digital natives now comes from the effective use of data\nat scale, primarily analytics and AI. Digital natives ‚Äî defined\nas fast-moving, lean, and technically savvy, born-in-the-cloud\norganizations ‚Äî are beginning to focus on new data-driven use\ncases such as real-time machine learning and personalized\ncustomer experiences.\n\nTo pursue these new data-intensive use cases and initiatives,\norganizations must look beyond the technologies that delivered\nthem to this point in time. Over time, these technologies, such\nas transactional databases, streaming/batch pipelines and firstgeneration analytics engines, have led to brittle\n\nThis guide examines some of the biggest data challenges and\nsolutions for startups and for scaling digital native businesses\nthat have reached the point where an end-to-end modern data\nplatform is a smart investment. Some key considerations include:\nsystems that are not cost-efficient and require time-consuming\nadministration and engineering toil. In addition to growing\nmaintenance needs, data is often stored in disparate locations\nand formats, with little or no governance, making real-time use\ncases, analytics and AI difficult or impossible.\n\n\n**Consolidating on a unified data platform**\nAs mentioned above, siloed data storage and management add administrative and\nfinancial cost. You can benefit significantly when you unify your data in one location\nwith a flexible architecture that scales with your needs and delivers performance\nfor future success. For this, you will want an open platform that supports all your\ndata including batch and streaming workloads, data analytics and machine learning.\nWith data unification, you create a more efficient, integrated approach to ingesting,\ncleaning and organizing your data. You also need automation to make data analysis\neasier for the nontechnical users in the company. But broader data access also\nmeans more focus on security, privacy, compliance and access control, which can\ncreate overhead for a growing.\n\n**Scaling up capacity and increasing performance**\n**and usability of the data solutions**\nData teams at growing digital native organizations find it time intensive and costly to\nhandle the growing volume and velocity of their data being ingested from multiple\nsources, across multiple clouds. You now need a unified and simplified platform that\ncan instantly scale up capacity and deliver more computing power on demand to\nfree up your data teams to produce outputs more quickly. This lowers the total cost\nfor the overall infrastructure by eliminating redundant licensing, infrastructure and\nadministration costs.\n\n**Building effective machine learning operations**\nFor data teams beginning their machine learning journeys, the challenge of training\ndata models can increase in management complexity. Many teams with disparate\ncoding needs for the entire model lifecycle suffer inefficiencies from transferring\ndata and code across many separate services. To build and manage effective\nML operations, consider an end-to-end MLOps environment that brings all data\ntogether in one place and incorporates managed services for experiment tracking,\nmodel training, feature development and feature and model serving.\n\n\n-----\n\n# 01\n```\nCHALLENGE: \u0003\n\n## Create a unified data architecture for data quality, governance and efficiency\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nCHALLENGE 01\n\n### Create a unified data architecture for data quality, governance and efficiency\n\n```\nAs cloud-born companies grow, data volumes rapidly increase, leading to new\nchallenges and use cases. Among the challenges:\n\n\nApplication stacks optimized for transaction\nuse cases aren‚Äôt able to handle the volume,\nvelocity and variety of data that modern data\nteams require. For example, this leads to query\nperformance issues as data volume grows.\n\nData silos develop as each team within an\norganization chooses different ETL/ELT and\nstorage solutions for their needs. As the\norganization grows and changes, these pipelines\nand storage solutions become brittle, hard to\nmaintain and nearly impossible to integrate.\n\n\nThese data silos lead to discoverability,\nintegration and access issues, which prevent\nteams from leveraging the full value of the\norganization‚Äôs available data.\n\nData governance is hard. Disparate ETL/ELT\nand storage solutions lead to governance,\ncompliance, auditability and access control\nchallenges, which expose organizations to\ntremendous risk.\n\n\nThe Databricks Lakehouse Platform provides\na unified set of tools for building, deploying,\nsharing and maintaining data solutions at scale.\nIt integrates with cloud storage and the security\nin your cloud account, manages and deploys\ncloud infrastructure on your behalf. Your data\npractitioners no longer need separate storage\nsystems for their data. And you don‚Äôt have to rely\non your cloud provider for security. The lakehouse\nhas its own robust security built into the platform.\n\n\nFor all the reasons above, the most\nconsistent advice from successful data\npractitioners is to create a ‚Äúsingle source\nof truth‚Äù by unifying all data on a single\nplatform. With the Databricks Lakehouse\nPlatform, you can unify all your data on one\nplatform, reducing data infrastructure costs\nand compute. You don‚Äôt need excess data\ncopies and you can retire expensive\nlegacy infrastructure.\n```\n                            01\n\n```\n\n-----\n\n```\nCUSTOMER STORY: GRAMMARLY\n\n### Helping 30 million people and 50,000 teams communicate more effectively\n\n```\n\nWhile its business is based on analytics, [Grammarly](http://www.grammarly.com)\n\nfor many years relied on a homegrown analytics\n\nplatform to drive its AI writing assistant to\n\nhelp users improve multiple aspects of written\n\ncommunications. As teams developed their own\n\nrequirements, data silos inevitably emerged as\n\ndifferent business areas implemented analytics\n\ntools individually.\n\n‚ÄúEvery team decided to solve their analytics\n\nneeds in the best way they saw fit,‚Äù said Chris\n\nLocklin, Engineering Manager, Data Platforms,\n\nat Grammarly. ‚ÄúThat created challenges in\n\nconsistency and knowing which data set\n\nwas correct.‚Äù\n\nTo better scale and improve data storage and\n\nquery capabilities, Grammarly brought all its\n\nanalytical data into the Databricks Lakehouse\n\nPlatform and created a central hub for all data\n\nproducers and consumers across the company.\n\nGrammarly had several goals with the lakehouse,\n\nincluding better access control, security, ingestion\n\n\nflexibility, reducing costs and fueling collaboration. ‚ÄúAccess control in a\n\ndistributed file system is difficult, and it only gets more complicated as\n\nyou ingest more data sources,‚Äù said Locklin. To manage access control,\n\nenable end-to-end observability and monitor data quality, Grammarly\n\nrelies on the data lineage capabilities within Unity Catalog. ‚ÄúData lineage\n\nallows us to effectively monitor usage of our data and ensure it upholds\n\nthe standards we set as a data platform team,‚Äù said Locklin. ‚ÄúLineage is\n\nthe last crucial piece for access control.‚Äù\n\nData analysts within Grammarly now have a consolidated interface for\n\nanalytics, which leads to a single source of truth and confidence in the\n\naccuracy and availability of all data managed by the data platform team.\n\nHaving a consistent data source across the company also resulted in\n\ngreater speed and efficiency and reduced costs. Data practitioners\n\nexperienced 110% faster querying at 10% of the cost to ingest compared\n\nto a data warehouse. Grammarly can now make its 5 billion daily events\n\navailable for analytics in under 15 minutes rather than 4 hours.

Here are three steps to get started with the\nDatabricks Lakehouse Platform:\n\n**Understand the architecture**\nThe lakehouse provides a unified architecture,\nmeaning that all data is stored in the same\naccessible place. The diagram shows how data\ncomes in from sources like a customer relationship\nmanagement (CRM) system, an enterprise resource\nplanning (ERP) system, websites or unstructured\ncustomer emails.\n\n**Optimize the storage layer**\nAll data is stored in cloud storage while Databricks\nprovides tooling to assist with ingestion, such as\nAuto Loader, and we recommend [open-source](https://delta.io/)\n[Delta Lake](https://docs.databricks.com/delta/index.html) as the storage format of choice.\nDelta optimized storage layer that provides the\nfoundation for storing data and tables in the\nDatabricks Lakehouse Platform. Having all your\ndata in the same optimized, open storage keeps\nall your use cases in the same place, thus enabling\ncollaboration and removing software tool overhead.\n\n\n\n-  the customer-owned infrastructure managed in\ncollaboration by Databricks and the customer.\n\n\nThe lakehouse handles all varieties of data (structured, semi-structured, unstructured),\nas well as all velocities of data (streaming, batch or somewhere in the middle).\n\n[Sign up for a free trial](https://www.databricks.com/try-databricks#account) account with the instructions on the [get started page.](https://docs.databricks.com/getting-started/index.html)\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Databricks Lakehouse organizes data stored with Delta Lake in cloud object\nstorage with familiar concepts like database, tables and views. Delta Lake extends\nParquet data files with a file-based transaction log for [ACID transactions](https://docs.databricks.com/lakehouse/acid.html) and\nscalable metadata handling. Delta Lake is fully compatible with Apache Spark APIs,\nand was developed for tight integration with Structured Streaming, allowing you to\neasily use a single copy of data for both batch and streaming operations to provide\nincremental processing at scale.This model combines many of the benefits of a data\nwarehouse with the scalability and flexibility of a data lake.\n\nTo learn more about the optimized storage layer that provides the foundation for\nstoring data and tables in the Databricks Lakehouse Platform, see [Getting started](https://docs.databricks.com/getting-started/delta.html)\n[with Delta Lake](https://docs.databricks.com/getting-started/delta.html) [.](https://docs.databricks.com/getting-started/delta.html)\n\nThe first step in unifying your data architecture is setting up how data is to be\naccessed and used across the organization. We‚Äôll discuss this as a series of steps:\n\n**1** Set up governance with Unity Catalog\n\n**2** Grant secure access to the data\n\n\n###### ‚ÄúDelta Lake provides us with a single source of truth for all of our data,‚Äù said Stone. ‚ÄúNow our data engineers are able to build reliable data pipelines that thread the needle on key topics, such as inventory management, allowing us to identify in near real-time what our trends are so we can figure out how to effectively move inventory.‚Äù\n ‚Äì Jake Stone, Senior Manager,  Business Analytics at ButcherBox \n\n[Learn more](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/02/07/how-butcherbox-uses-data-insights-to-provide-quality-food-tailored-to-each-customers-unique-taste.html)\n\n\n**3** Capture audit logs\n\n**4** View data lineage\n\n**5** Set up data sharing\n\n\n-----\n\n**Configure unified governance**\nDatabricks recommends using catalogs to provide an easily searchable inventory of data, notebooks, dashboards and models. Often this\nmeans that catalogs can correspond to software development environment scope, team or business unit. [Unity Catalog](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/get-started.html) manages how data\nis secured, accessed and shared. Unity Catalog offers a single place to administer data access policies that apply across all workspace and\npersonas and automatically captures user-level audit logs that record access to your data.\n\nData stewards can securely grant access to a broad set of users to discover and analyze data at scale. These users can use a variety of\nlanguages and tools, including SQL and Python, to create derivative data sets, models and dashboards that can be shared across teams.\n\nTo set up Unity Catalog for your organization,\nyou do the following:\n\n\n**1** Configure an S3 bucket and IAM role that\nUnity Catalog can use to store and access\ndata in your AWS account.\n\n**2** Create a metastore for each region in\n\nwhich your organization operates, and\nattach workspaces to the metastore. Each\nworkspace will have the same view of the\ndata you manage in Unity Catalog.\n\n\n**3** If you have a new account, add users,\ngroups and service principals to your\nDatabricks account.\n\n**4** Next, create and grant access to\n\ncatalogs, schemas and tables.\n\n\nFor complete setup instructions, see [Get started using Unity Catalog.](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/get-started.html#:~:text=To%20enable%20your%20Databricks%20account%20to%20use%20Unity,Transfer%20your%20metastore%20admin%20role%20to%20a%20group.)\n\n\n-----\n\n###### How Unity  Catalog works\n\n\nYou will notice that the hierarchy of primary data\nobjects in Unity Catalog flows from metastore to table:\n\n**Metastore** is the top-level container for metadata.\nEach metastore exposes a three-level namespace\n(catalog.schema.table) that organizes your data.\n\n\n**Metastore** **Catalog** **Schemas**\n\n\n**Views**\n\n**Managed**\n**Tables**\n\n\n**Catalog** is the first layer of the object hierarchy, used\nto organize your data assets.\n\n\n**Schemas** , also known as databases, are the second\nlayer of the object hierarchy and contain tables and\nviews.\n\n**Table** is the lowest level in the object hierarchy, and\ntables can be external (stored in external locations in\nyour cloud storage of choice) or managed (stored in a\nstorage container in your cloud storage that you create\n\nexpressly for Databricks). You can also create readonly **Views** from tables.\n\n\n**External**\n**tables**\n\nThe diagram below represents the file system\nhierarchy of a single storage bucket:\n\n\n-----\n\nUnity Catalog uses the identities in the Databricks\naccount to resolve users, service principals, and groups\nand to enforce permissions. To configure identities in\nthe account, follow the instructions in [Manage users,](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/users-groups/index.html)\n[service principals, and groups](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/users-groups/index.html) . Refer to those users,\nservice principals, and groups when you create\n[access-control policies](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/manage-privileges/index.html) in Unity Catalog.\n\nUnity Catalog users, service principals, and groups\nmust also be added to workspaces to access Unity\nCatalog data in a notebook, a Databricks SQL query,\nData Explorer or a REST API command. The assignment\nof users, service principals, and groups to workspaces\nis called identity federation. All workspaces attached\nto a Unity Catalog metastore are enabled for identity\nfederation.\n\nSecurable objects in Unity Catalog are hierarchical,\nmeaning that granting a privilege on a catalog or schema\nautomatically grants the privilege to all current and\nfuture objects within the catalog or schema. For more\non granting privileges, see the [Inheritance model](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/manage-privileges/privileges.html#inheritance) .\nA common scenario is to set up a schema per team\nwhere only that team has USE SCHEMA and CREATE on\nthe schema. This means that any tables produced by\nteam members can only be shared within the team.\nData Explorer uses the privileges configured by Unity\nCatalog administrators to ensure that users are only\nable to see catalogs, databases, tables and views that\nthey have permission to query.\n\n\n[Databricks Data Explorer](https://docs.databricks.com/data/index.html) is the main user interface for\nmany Unity Catalog features. Use Data Explorer to view\nschema details, preview sample data, and see table\ndetails and properties. Administrators can view and\nchange owners. Admins and data object owners can grant\nand revoke permissions through this interface.\n\n**Set up secure access**\nIn Unity Catalog, data is secure by default. Initially, users\nhave no access to data in a metastore. Access can\nbe granted by either a metastore admin, the owner of\nan object, or the owner of the catalog or schema that\ncontains the object. Securable objects in Unity Catalog\nare hierarchical and privileges are inherited downward.\n\nUnity Catalog‚Äôs security model is based on standard ANSI\nSQL and allows administrators to grant permissions in\ntheir existing data lake using familiar syntax, at the level of\ncatalogs, databases (schema), tables and views. Privileges\nand metastores are shared across workspaces, allowing\nadministrators to set secure permissions once against\n\ngroups synced from identity providers and know that\nend users only have access to the proper data in any\nDatabricks workspace they enter.\n\n\n-----\n\n```\nCUSTOMER STORY: BUTCHERBOX\n\n### How Butcherbox Uses Data Insights to Provide Quality Food Tailored to Each Customer‚Äôs Unique Taste\n\n```\n\nAs a young e-commerce company,\n\n[ButcherBox](https://www.butcherbox.com/) has to be nimble as its\n\ncustomers‚Äô needs change, which means it is\n\nconstantly considering behavioral patterns,\n\ndistribution center efficiency, a growing list of\n\nmarketing and communication channels, and\n\norder processing systems.\n\nThe meat and seafood subscription company\n\ncollects data on hundreds of thousands\n\nof subscribers. It deployed the Databricks\n\nLakehouse Platform to gain visibility across\n\nits diverse range of data systems and enable\n\nits analytics team to securely view and\n\nexport data in the formats needed.\n\nWith so much data feeding in from different\n\nsources ‚Äî from email systems to its website\n\n‚Äî the data team at ButcherBox quickly\n\ndiscovered that data silos were a significant\n\n\n‚ÄúWe knew we needed to migrate from our legacy data warehouse\n\nenvironment to a data analytics platform that would unify our\n\ndata and make it easily accessible for quick analysis to improve\n\nsupply chain operations, forecast demand and, most importantly,\n\nkeep up with our growing customer base,‚Äù explained Jake Stone,\n\nSenior Manager, Business Analytics, at ButcherBox.\n\nThe platform allows analysts to share builds and iterate on a\n\nproject without getting into the code. Querying a table of 18\n\nbillion rows would have been problematic with a traditional\n\nplatform. With Databricks, ButcherBox can do it in three minutes.\n\n‚ÄúDelta Lake provides us with a single source of truth for all of\n\nour data,‚Äù said Stone. ‚ÄúNow our data engineers are able to build\n\nreliable data pipelines that thread the needle on key topics such\n\nas inventory management, allowing us to identify in near real-\n\ntime what our trends are so we can figure out how to effectively\n\nmove inventory.‚Äù\n\n[Read the full story here.](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/02/07/how-butcherbox-uses-data-insights-to-provide-quality-food-tailored-to-each-customers-unique-taste.html)\n\n\nproblem because they blocked complete\n\nvisibility into critical insights needed to make\n\nstrategic and marketing decisions.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Set up secure data sharing**\nDatabricks uses an open protocol called [Delta Sharing](https://docs.databricks.com/data-sharing/index.html)\nto share data with other entities regardless of their\ncomputing platforms. Delta Sharing is integrated with\nUnity Catalog. Your data must be registered with Unity\nCatalog to manage, govern, audit and track usage of the\nshared data on the Lakehouse Platform. The primary\nconcepts of Delta Sharing are shares (read-only\ncollections of tables and table partitions to be shared)\nand recipients (objects that associate an organization\nwith a credential or secure sharing identifier).\n\nAs a data provider, you generate a token and share\nit securely with the recipient. They use the token to\nauthenticate and get read access to the tables you‚Äôve\nincluded in the shares you‚Äôve given them access\nto. Recipients access the shared data in read-only\nformat. Whenever the data provider updates data\ntables in their own Databricks account, the updates\nappear in near real-time in the recipient‚Äôs system.\n\n\n**Capture audit logs**\nUnity Catalog captures an audit log of actions\nperformed against the metastore. To access audit\nlogs for Unity Catalog events, you must enable and\nconfigure audit logs for your account. Audit logs for\neach workspace and account-level activities are\ndelivered to your account. See how to [configure audit](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/audit.html)\n[logs](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/audit.html) and create a dashboard to analyze audit log data.\n\n**View data lineage**\nYou can use Unity Catalog to capture runtime data\nlineage across queries in any language executed on\na Databricks cluster or SQL warehouse. Lineage can\nbe visualized in Data Explorer in near real-time and\nretrieved with the Databricks REST API. Lineage is\naggregated across all workspaces attached to Unity\nCatalog and captured down to the column level, and\nincludes notebooks, workflows and dashboards related\nto the query. To understand the requirements and how\nto capture lineage data, see [Capture and view data](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/data-lineage.html)\n[lineage with Unity Catalog](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/data-lineage.html) .\n\n\nUnity Catalog Metastore\n\n\nCatalog\n\n\nData providers can use Databricks audit logging to\nmonitor the creation and modification of shares,\nand recipients can monitor recipient activity on\nshares. Data recipients who use shared data in a\nDatabricks account can use Databricks audit logging\nto understand who is accessing which data.\n\n\n-----\n\n###### Resources:\n\n-  [Databricks documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/?_ga=2.8076210.1659353804.1668454132-1193545868.1666711643)\n\n-  [Getting Started With Delta Lake](https://docs.databricks.com/delta/index.html)\n\n-  [Webinar: Deep Dive Into Lakehouse With Delta Lake](https://www.databricks.com/p/webinar/deep-dive-into-lakehouse-with-delta-lake-complimentary-training)\n\n-  [Big Book of Data Engineering Use Cases](https://www.databricks.com/explore/de-data-warehousing/big-book-of-data-engineering#page=1)\n\n-  [10 Powerful Features to Simplify Semi-structured](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2021/11/11/10-powerful-features-to-simplify-semi-structured-data-management-in-the-databricks-lakehouse.html)\n[Data Management in the Databricks Lakehouse](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2021/11/11/10-powerful-features-to-simplify-semi-structured-data-management-in-the-databricks-lakehouse.html)\n\n\n###### Key Takeaways\n\n-  With the Databricks Lakehouse Platform, you can\nunify and simplify all your data on one platform\nto better scale and improve data storage and\nquery capabilities\n\n-  The lakehouse helps reduce data infrastructure\nand compute costs.

This inevitably leads to\nthe increasing complexity of data architecture as new storage and access patterns emerge. Data growth can come\nsuddenly and unexpectedly, when it does, the existing architecture needs to sustain performance, all the while being\ncost-effective.

           "‚ÄúData warehouses were designed to provide a central data repository with analytic compute capabilities to help business leaders get analytical insights, support decision-making and business intelligence (BI). Legacy on-premises data warehouse architectures are difficult to scale and make it difficult for data teams to keep up with the exponential growth of data. Oftentimes data teams publish and use a subset of well-defined data for development and testing. This slows down both innovation and time to insight. Cloud data warehouses (CDW) were an attempt to tackle the on-premises data warehouse challenges. CDWs removed the administrative burden of tasks such as setup, upgrades and backups. CDWs also improved scalability and introduced cloud‚Äôs pay-as-you-go model to reduce cost. CDWs leverage a proprietary data format to achieve cloud-scale and performance; however, this also leads to customers locked into these formats with difficult But enterprise data teams don‚Äôt need a better data warehouse. They need an innovative, simple solution that provides reliable performance, elastic scale and allows self-service to unblock analytics to access all data at a reasonable cost. The answer is the lakehouse. The lakehouse pattern represents a paradigm shift from traditional on-premises data warehouse systems that are expensive and complex to manage. It uses an open data management architecture that combines the flexibility, cost-efficiency and scale of data lakes with the data management and ACID semantics of data warehouses.‚Äù",
