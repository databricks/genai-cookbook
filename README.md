# Retrieval Augmented Generation

Please visit http://ai-cookbook.io for the accompanying documentation for this repo.

This repo provides [learning materials](https://ai-cookbook.io/) and [production-ready code](https://github.com/databricks/genai-cookbook/tree/main/agent_app_sample_code) to build a **high-quality RAG application** using Databricks. The [Mosaic Generative AI Cookbook](https://ai-cookbook.io/) provides:
  - A conceptual overview and deep dive into various Generative AI design patterns, such as Prompt Engineering, Agents, RAG, and Fine Tuning
  - An overview of Evaluation-Driven development
  - The theory of every parameter/knob that impacts quality
  - How to root cause quality issues and detemermine which knobs are relevant to experiment with for your use case
  - Best practices for how to experiment with each knob

The [provided code](https://github.com/databricks/genai-cookbook/tree/main/agent_app_sample_code) is intended for use with the Databricks platform.  Specifically:
- [Mosaic AI Agent Framework](https://docs.databricks.com/en/generative-ai/retrieval-augmented-generation.html) which provides a fast developer workflow with enterprise-ready LLMops & governance
- [Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation](https://docs.databricks.com/en/generative-ai/agent-evaluation/index.html) which provides reliable, quality measurement using proprietary AI-assisted LLM judges to measure quality metrics that are powered by human feedback collected through an intuitive web-based chat UI
