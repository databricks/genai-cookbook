### Instruction:
What is the relationship between interest rates and the economy?

### Response:
","Central banks typically adjust interest rates as a way to influence inflation and economic growth. When a country is experiencing high rates of inflation, its central bank will typically increase the interest rate which will increase the cost of credit and therefore reduce economic demand and consumption. Reduced demand will lead to reduced prices and less inflation. When a country is experiencing deflation, the central bank will typically decrease interest rates to reduce cost of credit and increase consumption. Central banks must be careful with interest rates. High interest rates for a sustained period of time can lead to a recession. Whereas, low interest rates for a sustained period of time can lead to hyperinflation and an overheated economy."

When was the first Fallout game released?
Fallout is a series of post-apocalyptic role-playing video games—and later action role-playing games—created by Interplay Entertainment. The series is set during the 21st, 22nd and 23rd centuries, and its atompunk retrofuturistic setting and art work are influenced by the post-war culture of 1950s United States, with its combination of hope for the promises of technology and the lurking fear of nuclear annihilation. A forerunner of Fallout is Wasteland, a 1988 game developed by Interplay Productions to which the series is regarded as a spiritual successor.

The series' first title, Fallout, was developed by Black Isle Studios and released in 1997, and its sequel, Fallout 2, the following year. With the tactical role-playing game Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel, development was handed to Micro Forté and 14 Degrees East. In 2004, Interplay closed Black Isle Studios,[2] and continued to produce Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel, an action game with role-playing elements for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, without Black Isle Studios. Fallout 3, the third entry in the main series, was released in 2008 by Bethesda Softworks, and was followed by Fallout: New Vegas, developed by Obsidian Entertainment. Fallout 4 was released in 2015, and Fallout 76 released on November 14, 2018.

Bethesda Softworks owns the rights to the Fallout intellectual property.[3] After acquiring it, Bethesda licensed the rights to make a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) version of Fallout to Interplay. The MMORPG got as far as beta stage under Interplay,[4] but a lengthy legal dispute between Bethesda Softworks and Interplay halted the development of the game and led to its eventual cancellation, as Bethesda claimed in court that Interplay had not met the terms and conditions of the licensing contract. The case was settled in early 2012.[5]

Origins
The ideas of the Fallout series began with Interplay Productions' Wasteland, released in 1988. At that time, Interplay was not a publisher and used Electronic Arts for distribution of the game. According to Interplay's founder, Brian Fargo, they wanted to explore a post-apocalyptic setting and created Wasteland for that. Sometime after release, Interplay decided to shift focus and become a publisher while still developing games. Fargo wanted to continue to use the Wasteland intellectual property but could not negotiate the rights back from Electronic Arts. Still wanting to do something in a post-apocalyptic setting, Fargo and his team decided to make a new setting and game. They determined what aspects of Wasteland were positives and wrote and developed a new game around them. The result was the first Fallout games, which released nearly ten years after Wasteland.[6]

### Response:
","Fallout (1997)
Released in October 1997, Fallout takes place in a post-apocalyptic Southern California, beginning in the year 2161. The protagonist, referred to as the Vault Dweller, is tasked with recovering a water chip in the Wasteland to replace the broken one in their underground shelter home, Vault 13. Afterwards, the Vault Dweller must thwart the plans of a group of mutants, led by a grotesque entity named the Master. Fallout was originally intended to run under the GURPS role-playing game system. However, a disagreement with the creator of GURPS, Steve Jackson, over the game's violent content required Black Isle Studios to develop the new SPECIAL system.[7] Fallout's atmosphere and artwork are reminiscent of post-World War II United States during the Cold War era and the fear that the country was headed for nuclear war in the real world.[8]"

What is the best way to get more protein in my diet?

### Response:
","Ensure that at least 50% of each meal is consisted of protein. Animal products like chicken and beef are the easiest ways of consuming whole protein. Animal byproducts like cheese, eggs, cottage cheese, and greek yogurt are a great way to supplement protein intake, as long as you are keeping an eye out for fat, cholesterol and sugar, which can sometimes come in large amounts in those products. Topping your meals with high-protein nuts like almonds or pistachios is a clever and sneaky way of getting some extra protein in your food. If you still aren't getting enough protein in your diet, you can supplement with a protein shake. This is a great option for people that don't consume animal products, as many protein powders are plant-based. Other plant-based proteins sources are tofu, legumes, quinoa and edamame."

What is contrafact?
Parker's style of composition involved interpolation of original melodies over existing jazz forms and standards, a practice known as contrafact and still common in jazz today. Examples include ""Ornithology"" (which borrows the chord progression of jazz standard ""How High the Moon"" and is said to be co-written with trumpet player Little Benny Harris), and ""Moose The Mooche"" (one of many Parker compositions based on the chord progression of ""I Got Rhythm""). The practice was not uncommon prior to bebop, but it became a signature of the movement as artists began to move away from arranging popular standards and toward composing their own material. Perhaps Parker's most well-known contrafact is ""Koko,"" which is based on the chord changes of the popular bebop tune ""Cherokee,"" written by Ray Noble.[45]

### Response:
","Contrafact is a type of jazz composition where the composer takes the basic structure of a popular song, rearranges it and provides a new melody to the song. Charlie Parker was a jazz musician and composer who used this style of composition extensively. Some of the best known examples of Parker's use of contrafact are:
""Ornithology""- Based on the popular song ""How High the Moon""
""Moose the Moose""- Based on the standard ""I've Got Rhythm""
""Koko""-Based on the swing standard ""Cherokee"""

What is the Turkish drink that tastes similar to
Ouzo is a clear liquid. However, when water or ice is added, ouzo turns a milky-white colour. This is because anethole, the essential oil of anise, is completely soluble in alcohol at approximately 38% ABV and above, but not in water. Diluting the spirit causes it to separate, creating an emulsion whose fine droplets scatter the light. This process is called louching and is also seen while preparing absinthe.

The drinks with a similar flavour of Ouzu include sambuca from (Italy), pastis from (France), oghi (from Armenia), rakı from Turkey, and arak (from the Levant). Its aniseed flavour is also similar to the anise-flavoured liqueur of anís (Spain) and the stronger spirits of absinthe (France and Switzerland). Aguardiente (Latin America), made from sugar cane, is also similar. The Italian drink Pallini Mistra, named after the Greek city of Mystras in the Peloponnese is a version of ouzo made in Rome that closely resembles Greek and Cypriot ouzo.

Based on the given text, what is the population growth rate of Afghanistan since 1979?
The population of Afghanistan was estimated at 32.9 million as of 2019 by the Afghanistan Statistics and Information Authority, whereas the UN estimates over 38.0 million. In 1979 the total population was reported to be about 15.5 million. About 23.9% of them are urbanite, 71.4% live in rural areas, and the remaining 4.7% are nomadic. An additional 3 million or so Afghans are temporarily housed in neighboring Pakistan and Iran, most of whom were born and raised in those two countries.

### Response:
","There are varying accounts of the population of Afghanistan. The Afghanistan Statistics and Information Authority estimated the population at 32.9 million in 2019 whereas the UN estimates it at 38.90 million. In 1979 the total population was reported to be about 15.5 million. Using the following formula:

Percentage Increase = ((Final Value - Starting Value)/(Starting Value)) * 100

Using the Afghan Statistics and Information Authority Estimate:

Percentage Increase = ((32.9 - 15.5)/(15.5)) * 100 = 112.25%

Using the UN Estimate:

Percentage Increase = ((38.90 - 15.5)/(15.5)) * 100 = 150.96%

Therefore, the percentage growth rate of the population of Afghanistan is either 112.25% (Afghan Statistics and Information Authority) or 150.96% (UN) based on the two estimates provided."

What are some areas that firefighters can safely stay in while fighting a wildfire?
Outcomes from Project Vesta have been integrated into firefighter training in Australia and are beginning to appear in the United States.

Firefighters try to stay out of the dead man zone at all times, working from safe points such as burnt ground or a large area of non-burnable ground, such as a cricket or Australian rules football oval, or a large car park. This is achieved by attacking the fire from the flanks, or the rear, so that burnt ground is always nearby, and the fire is always in front of the firefighters. This avoids two disadvantages of attacking fires at the head of the fire where spot fires may start behind them or changes in wind behavior might accelerate the spread of the fire.

The result of several inquiries into firefighter death in Australian bushfires found that firefighters should stay out of the dead man zone and that they should always keep 250 liters of water in their truck for personal safety. This is now a standard operating procedure in the NSW Rural Fire Service, Country Fire Service and Country Fire Authority in Australia.

Humans (Homo sapiens) are the most common and widespread species of primate in the great ape family Hominidae, and also the most common species of primate overall. Humans are broadly characterized by their bipedalism and high intelligence. Humans' large brain and resulting cognitive skills have allowed them to thrive in a variety of environments and develop complex societies and civilizations. Humans are highly social and tend to live in complex social structures composed of many cooperating and competing groups, from families and kinship networks to political states. As such, social interactions between humans have established a wide variety of values, social norms, languages, and rituals, each of which bolsters human society. The desire to understand and influence phenomena has motivated humanity's development of science, technology, philosophy, mythology, religion, and other conceptual frameworks.

Although some scientists equate the term ""humans"" with all members of the genus Homo, in common usage it generally refers to Homo sapiens, the only extant member. Anatomically modern humans emerged around 300,000 years ago in Africa, evolving from Homo heidelbergensis or a similar species and migrating out of Africa, gradually replacing or interbreeding with local populations of archaic humans. For most of history, humans were nomadic hunter-gatherers. Humans began exhibiting behavioral modernity about 160,000–60,000 years ago. The Neolithic Revolution, which began in Southwest Asia around 13,000 years ago (and separately in a few other places), saw the emergence of agriculture and permanent human settlement. As populations became larger and denser, forms of governance developed within and between communities, and a number of civilizations have risen and fallen. Humans have continued to expand, with a global population of over 8 billion as of 2022.

Genes and the environment influence human biological variation in visible characteristics, physiology, disease susceptibility, mental abilities, body size, and life span. Though humans vary in many traits (such as genetic predispositions and physical features), any two humans are at least 99% genetically similar. Humans are sexually dimorphic: generally, males have greater body strength and females have a higher body fat percentage. At puberty, humans develop secondary sexual characteristics. Females are capable of pregnancy, usually between puberty, at around 12 years old, and menopause, around the age of 50.

Humans are omnivorous, capable of consuming a wide variety of plant and animal material, and have used fire and other forms of heat to prepare and cook food since the time of Homo erectus. Humans can survive for up to eight weeks without food and three or four days without water. Humans are generally diurnal, sleeping on average seven to nine hours per day. Childbirth is dangerous, with a high risk of complications and death. Often, both the mother and the father provide care for their children, who are helpless at birth.

Humans have a large, highly developed, and complex prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain associated with higher cognition. Humans are highly intelligent, capable of episodic memory, have flexible facial expressions, self-awareness, and a theory of mind. The human mind is capable of introspection, private thought, imagination, volition, and forming views on existence. This has allowed great technological advancements and complex tool development to be possible through complex reasoning and the transmission of knowledge to subsequent generations. Language, art, and trade are defining characteristics of humans. Long-distance trade routes might have led to cultural explosions and resource distribution that gave humans an advantage over other similar species.

Given this paragraph about ferrets, do they spend the majority of the time sleeping in a 24 hour day?
Ferrets spend 14–18 hours a day asleep and are most active around the hours of dawn and dusk, meaning they are crepuscular. If they are caged, they should be taken out daily to exercise and satisfy their curiosity; they need at least an hour and a place to play. Unlike their polecat ancestors, which are solitary animals, most ferrets will live happily in social groups. They are territorial, like to burrow, and prefer to sleep in an enclosed area.

Who is Mariano Sánchez?
Mariano Sánchez Martínez (born 28 January 1978) is a Spanish former professional footballer who played as a defensive midfielder.

He appeared in 108 Segunda División games over three seasons, scoring two goals for Cartagena.

Club career
Born in San Pedro del Pinatar, Region of Murcia, Sánchez did not reach the Segunda División B until he was 26, in 2004, arriving at CD Alcoyano from amateurs AD Mar Menor-San Javier. In the following year he moved to another club at that level, FC Cartagena, helping it promote to Segunda División in his fourth season.

Sánchez made his debut in the competition on 29 August 2009 at the age of 31 years and seven months, playing the full 90 minutes in a 1–0 away win against Girona FC.[1] He scored his first league goal on 22 May 2010 in the 3–5 home loss to Levante UD,[2] and never appeared in less than 34 league matches during his three seasons in that tier, suffering relegation in his last and renewing his contract for a further two years in June 2012.[3]

On 14 May 2014, the 36-year-old Sánchez announced he would retire at the end of the campaign while hoping to help his team promote, which eventually did not befell.[4]

Personal life
Sánchez rejected an offer to play youth football for Real Murcia when he was 18, after deciding to move to Madrid to study architecture. Not being able to enter Real Madrid's youth system, he chose to retire from football.[5]

After his playing days, Sánchez continued to work as an architect. Still as an active player, he was the figurehead behind the creation of the sports complex Pinatar Arena, in his hometown.[6][4]

","Mariano Sánchez Martínez, also known as Mariano Sánchez is a Spanish former professional footballer who played as a defensive midfielder."

Given this text about speakers of varieties of Louisiana French, has the number of French speakers in Texas increased or decreased since the middle of the twentieth century?
Reliable counts of speakers of Louisiana French are difficult to obtain as distinct from other varieties of French. However, the vast majority of native residents of Louisiana and east and southeast Texas who speak French are likely speakers of Louisiana French.

In Louisiana, as of 2010, the population of French speakers was approximately 115,183.[36] These populations were concentrated most heavily in the southern, coastal parishes.

In Texas, as of 2010, the French-speaking population was 55,773, though many of these were likely immigrants from France and other locations, living in the urban areas.[36] Nevertheless, in the rural eastern/southeastern Texas counties of Orange, Jefferson, Chambers, Newton, Jasper, Tyler, Liberty, and Hardin alone—areas where it can be reasonably presumed that almost all French speakers are Louisiana French speakers—the total French-speaking population was composed of 3,400 individuals. It is likely a substantial portion of the 14,493 speakers in Houston's Harris county are also Louisiana French speakers. With this in mind, a marked decline in the number of French speakers in Texas has been noticed in the last half of the twentieth century. For example, at one point[when?] the French-speaking population of Jefferson County was 24,049 as compared to the mere 1,922 today. Likewise, in Harris County the French-speaking population has shifted from 26,796 to 14,493 individuals.[37]

Louisiana French-speaking populations can also be found in southern Mississippi and Alabama, as well as pockets in other parts of the United States.

### Response:
","It has generally decreased.  For example, in the second half of the twentieth century, the French-speaking population of Jefferson County was 24,049 as compared to 1,922 today. Similarly, in Harris County the French-speaking population has shifted from 26,796 to 14,493."

What is the experience of Microsoft Office users moving to Google Docs?

### Response:
","Microsoft Office has been an enterprise software of choice for over 2 decades.  Long term users have seen Office evolve from its early days when it was installed on Windows machines to the relatively new Office 365 that is deployed online.  The key products in the Microsoft Office suite used by enterprises have been Word, Excel and Powerpoint. Google Docs is also an enterprise offering that consists of Docs, Sheets and Slides - these map to the corresponding Microsoft Office suite products listed.  Users who have been on Microsoft Office for many years find the move to Google Docs difficult.  This is because the commands across Google Docs are quite different to Office and one needs to spend time searching for MS office equivalent commands.  For example, the keyboard shortcut command to insert a freeze pane in windows excel is not the same in Google Sheets.  Formulae in cells and data analysis in Sheets is also different in sheets when compared to Excel. While it takes some time to unlearn commands and learn new ones as one moves from Microsoft Office to Google Docs, once one has spent some time working with Google Docs it starts to get easier.  And features such as ease of collaboration, never losing any content ever again, being able to work on the go from anywhere become the norm.  In summary, a user who has worked on Office for many years may find it difficult in the beginning but users who start with Google Docs will be comfortable from the beginning."

### Instruction:
Should the US government pay reparations?

### Response:
","Due to potential issues regarding responsibility, distribution, and cost, the U.S. Government should not award monetary reparations to the descendants of slaves. Wether or not the current government is ultimately responsible for the treatment of slaves, providing reparations, or monetary repayment for the government’s transgressions towards slaves, for the descendants of slaves may not be the most practical of beneficial solution. Instead, the government should focus on funding schooling, medicare, and communities of disadvantaged people of color.
A major flaw in the distribution of monetary reparations is determining which individuals or communities are descendants of slaves. Because slavery ended over 150 years ago, “most institutions don’t have good enough records to trace the actual descendants of slaves” (Jones). The potential inaccuracy in identifying descendants could lead to overspending on reparations, potential accusations of fraud, and countless other complaints.
	Responsibility also plays a large role in determining if or how to distribute monetary reparations. While plantation owners are notoriously considered slave owners, “the Catholic Church was among the largest institutional slaveholders in the Americas” (Jones). Other large corporations which took advantage of the American slave system include both insurance and railroad companies: “Insurance companies sold policies on the lives of enslaved people (for their owners’ profit, of course) or underwrote slaving voyages. Railroads used slave labor and profited from transporting cotton or rice produced by enslaved plantation workers” (Jones). Given that both religious and industrial groups also had a rather large influence on the American slave system, the responsibility of the government to repay the descendants of slaves seems unreasonable. 
To be able to pay the descendants of slaves, the government would also have to spend an excessive amount of money. Payment for slave labor requires adding up 24 hours, 365 days, for 246 years, plus inflation, the overall amount estimated to be upwards of $10 trillion. Even in smaller amounts “seeding each account with $25,000 would cost the government $100 billion a year, equal to ‘about 2% of federal expenditures now’” (Huddleston). Is that amount worth it? During his testimony, Beckett argued that money reparations are meaningless. Throwing money at a problem won’t solve it: it won’t end racism and it will cause the economy to plummet deeper in debt, creating more issues than it solves (Beckett). Not only would these reparations be a waste of taxpayer money, but it is understood that “the majority of Americans were not slave owners and even in the South, only one in five owned slaves,” more convincingly, “many Americans today have no connection to slavery at all since they immigrated here after 1865” (Source G). 
Arguments could be made for the imbalance of reparations, as minorities such as Native American tribes have been given land and monetary reparations by the U.S. government. While these minorities have received reparations, these reparations directly to the victims. A table of previous reparations payments made to minorities/racially targeted groups that span from 1952-1990. The most recent and largest payment was in 1990, from the US government to Japanese American citizens, of $1.2 billion (about $20,000 each) in response to the Japanese encampments during World War II (Source D). While these payments were made to these minority groups, all these reparations were ordered while the original victims of the injustices were still alive, not over 150 years after the fact.
The complete dismissal of reparations, however, should not be administered. Focusing our attention on better ways to repay the descendants of slaves would be generally beneficial to the country, as Nathalie argued that descendants have no wealth. Given that a major source of wealth is inheritance, the lack of black property ownership means a less distinctive inheritance among black families for future generations (Nathalie). While reparations can be spent in the communities of descendants and underfunded black families, this affects people who may not be descendants, not specific to victims: “Recipients of reparations should be ‘the direct victims of the injustice or their immediate families’” (Source G). Despite this, former President Barack Obama stated that “the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed,” and that those reparations could potentially “take the form of government programs to help struggling people of all races” (Source E). During her testimony, Michelle agreed, claiming that using reparations as a way of creating better schools and jobs for people who are struggling is a more beneficial way to use these monetary reparations (Michelle). Overall, the U.S. government, rather than distributing payments to individuals or communities, should focus on funding underprivileged or discriminated communities of traditionally black descendants, as this approach would create more opportunities and equality for discriminated black communities."

In historical linguistics, transphonologization (also known as rephonologization or cheshirization, see below) is a type of sound change whereby a phonemic contrast that used to involve a certain feature X evolves in such a way that the contrast is preserved, yet becomes associated with a different feature Y.

### Response:
","In historical linguistics, transphonologization (also known as rephonologization or cheshirization, see below) is a type of sound change whereby a phonemic contrast that used to involve a certain feature X evolves in such a way that the contrast is preserved, yet becomes associated with a different feature Y.

For example, a language contrasting two words */sat/ vs. */san/ may evolve historically so that final consonants are dropped, yet the modern language preserves the contrast through the nature of the vowel, as in a pair /sa/ vs. /sã/. Such a situation would be described by saying that a former contrast between oral and nasal consonants has been transphonologized into a contrast between oral and nasal vowels.

The term transphonologization was coined by André-Georges Haudricourt. The concept was defined and amply illustrated by Hagège & Haudricourt; it has been mentioned by several followers of panchronic phonology, and beyond."

Madonna Louise Ciccone (born August 16, 1958) is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. Dubbed the ""Queen of Pop"", Madonna has been widely recognized for her continual reinvention and versatility in music production, songwriting, and visual presentation. She has pushed the boundaries of artistic expression in mainstream music while continuing to maintain control over every aspect of her career. Her works, which incorporate social, political, sexual, and religious themes, have generated both controversy and critical acclaim. A prominent cultural figure of the 20th and 21st centuries, Madonna remains one of the most ""well-documented figures of the modern age"", with a broad amount of scholarly reviews and literature works on her, as well as an academic mini subdiscipline devoted to her named Madonna studies.

With sales of over 300 million records worldwide, Madonna is the best-selling female recording artist of all time. She is the most successful solo artist in the history of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and has achieved the most number-one singles by a woman in Australia, Canada, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. With a revenue of over U.S. $1.5 billion from her concert tickets, she remains the highest-grossing female touring artist worldwide. Forbes has named Madonna the annual top-earning female musician a record 11 times across four decades (1980s–2010s). She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008, her first year of eligibility. Madonna was ranked as the greatest woman in music by VH1, and as the greatest music video artist ever by MTV and Billboard. Rolling Stone also listed her among its greatest artists and greatest songwriters of all time.

### Response:
","Madonna is known worldwide as the top-selling female pop artist of all time. She has enjoyed global acclaim -- and criticism -- for her sometimes provocative work spanning over four decades. Her work includes recorded music, live performance, and several film credits."

### Instruction:
Given a reference text about the adverse affects of Foley catheters, please list the main risks.
Catheterized bladders become colonized by microorganisms very quickly, with a daily incidence of 3-10%; after four days, between 10-30% of patients develop bacteriuria.[11] Whilst the presence of a catheter does increase the incidence of bloodstream infections secondary to a urinary origin, there is a huge amount of unnecessary, and likely harmful, antimicrobial prescribing on the basis of detection of asymptomatic bacteriuria. The industry is moving to silver-coated catheters in an attempt to reduce the incidence of urinary tract infections, although there is limited evidence of efficacy. An additional problem is that Foley catheters tend to become coated over time with a biofilm that can obstruct the drainage. This increases the amount of stagnant urine left in the bladder, which further contributes to urinary tract infections. When a Foley catheter becomes clogged, it must be flushed or replaced. There is currently not enough adequate evidence to conclude whether washouts are beneficial or harmful.[12]

### Response:
","The risks of a Foley catheter include urinary tract and bloodstream infections. In addition, overprescribing of medications to treat infections leads to what is likely additional risk."

Where was Samuel Loew born?
Samuel ben Nathan Ha-Levi Loew (Kelin or Kolin) (also ""Lōw"" or ""Löw"", Hebrew: שמואל בן נתן נטע הלוי קעלין; c. 1720–1806) was a Talmudist and Halakhist, best known for his work Machatzit HaShekel (Ashkenazi pronunciation, Machatzis HaShekel).

The son of Nathan Naṭe ha-Levi, he was born at Kolín, Bohemia. For nearly 60 years he headed over a yeshiva at Boskovice (Boskowitz), Moravia, where he died on May 20, 1806. He had the title Av Beis Din of Boskowitz.[1]

If McDonald’s were to go out of business and disappear, would the world be a better or worse place?

### Response:
","McDonald’s has more than 36 thousand locations in 190 countries, and people still cannot believe that McDonald's would soon put a period to the honorable accomplishment they did in the last several years making 4.73 billion dollars in a year as a whole. I do believe McDonald’s disappearance would have some difference in some communities in the short term since there are 210,000 people working at McDonald’s. And also, it can have environmental, and medical benefits that can make the world a better place.
    The world is hugely affected by McDonald’s action, which makes the disappearance of McDonald’s could make the world a better place although it could have some negative influence on equality and education. Although McDonald's helps organizations that help people who lack education, suffer in poverty, or fight against discrimination, the positive impact of McDonald’s departure makes the world a better place. For example, since McDonald’s cut down the forest to build a cow farm, it can cause deforestation that is threatening the ecosystem and animal habitats. In addition, McDonald’s produces 2 million tons of packaging each year. This means that the retirement of McDonald’s could prevent habitat loss, deforestation, and even waste problems and have a huge, positive impact on the environment.
    However, the change in McDonald's retirement causes would vary between different stakeholders, but overall, it would only have a mild, or little difference between people’s lives. Although McDonald’s disappearance might shock many people, after a short term, the other fast-food restaurants would replace McDonald’s, so fast-food lovers could adapt to the new environment. Furthermore, although 210,000 people could lose their job, it is still possible for them to change to another job, or have an opportunity to change into another job that they have an interest in. Therefore, McDonald’s disappearance could have little or no difference at all to some people, and withdraw from all the honorable accomplishments.
    In conclusion, I think that the disappearance of McDonald’s can make the world a better place for environmental, and medical reasons although it could have negative effects in some communities, and that McDonald’s would not be forgotten by the joy and honorable achievements that they have achieved in the last few years."

Jill, a 60-year-old personal training client, wants to improve her hip flexibility. Jill is concerned about her balance and the risk of falling. Recommend two exercises she can do to improve balance.

### Response:
","She can perform weight shifts, which is an easy exercise for someone of her age to perform to improve their balance. She should begin with feet hip-width apart, and then shift her weight to her right side, lifting her left foot off the floor. She can maintain this position for 30 seconds, return to the starting position, and repeat for her other side. Besides weight shifts, she can focus on exercises that target auxiliary muscles in her lower back and core, which help with balance. For example, she can consider doing partial sit-ups, which strengthen abdominal muscles, or if she finds that too difficult, she can perform cat and camel, which is where she arches her back, and then lets it slowly sag toward the floor while in modified pushup position (knees on the ground)."

Can you give me a short summary of Mindfulness and how to practice it?

### Response:
","Mindfulness is a technique that can be used to bring your mind and focus into the present moment, and calm your nervous system.

The most common way to begin to practice mindfulness is to narrow and focus your attention on your breath. Some techniques prefer breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth, although this is not required. One way to narrow your attention is to closely observe the sensation of cool air as it passes over the tip of your nose, and the sensation of your chest falling as you exhale. Allow any rising thoughts to pass through your mind without paying attention to them, or engaging with them.

Other techniques involve focusing your attention to sensations in your body like hot and cold, or pain. You can also bring your focus to feelings like fear, anxiety, or love - focus your attention on where exactly in the body you feel those feelings. You can also move your attention to external stimulus like sounds, and your visual field.

Mindfulness is an extremely powerful technique that anyone can do from anywhere. Good luck practicing!"

What sacrifices did Ons's parents make to help her tennis career?
Ons Jabeur was born to Samira and Ridha Jabeur in Ksar Hellal, a small town in Tunisia.[4] She grew up in the larger nearby coastal town of Sousse.[5] Jabeur has two older brothers, Hatem and Marwen, and an older sister, Yasmine.[4][6] Her mother played tennis recreationally and introduced her to the sport at the age of three.[7] Jabeur trained under coach Nabil Mlika for ten years from ages four to thirteen, originally starting to work with him at a tennis promotion centre at her school. When she was ten years old, her club did not have their own tennis courts and she could only train on courts at nearby hotels.[8] At twelve years old, Jabeur moved to the capital city of Tunis to train at the Lycée Sportif El Menzah, a national sport high school for the country's up-and-coming athletes, where she stayed for several years.[5]

She also later trained in Belgium and France starting at the age of 16.[5][8] Jabeur credits her parents for the sacrifices they made when she was growing up, saying, ""My parents sacrificed a lot of things – my mom used to drive me everywhere around Tunisia to go play the tournaments, and she encouraged me to go to a special school to study. That was a big sacrifice to see her little girl going for a dream that, honestly, wasn't 100% guaranteed. She believed in me and gave me the confidence to be there.""[7]

Why does it help to focus on the breath when practicing mindfulness?

### Response:
","The art of meditation, which is another name for the practice of mindfulness, is all about being in the present.  In other words, cultivating an awareness of what is happening in the present moment.  This is done by quietening the mind of all the random thoughts that are being continuously generated, and having the senses alerted to the signals that are being passed in the moment.  The signals are the sensations or emotions or sounds that one is feeling and hearing in the present moment.  To accomplish this, the breath serves as an anchor to the present moment.  Being aware of one's breath keeps us in the present moment.  When the mind eventually wanders, the breath is a signal to tune back into the present moment.  The breath is always with us and can be found in an instant."

How do you jump start a car?

### Response:
","1. Make sure both batteries have the same voltage (they probably do unless one car is old). Don’t jump start a frozen battery (it may explode), or a battery with cracks in the casing
Keep metal objects away from the battery. If they cause a spark it could be dangerous.

2. Park the two cars facing each other, close but with enough space to walk in between.

3. Remove the keys from the ignitions, turn off lights/blinkers.

4. Disconnect all accessories (voltage spikes can damage them).

5. Clamp one of the red (positive) clamp to the positive terminal of the dead battery. If there is corrosion on the terminal, clean off or scrape the residue, and/or twist the jaws of the clamp until it cuts through the corrosion and into the metal. Make sure the black clamp of the same end isn’t touching any metal.

6. Connect the other red clamp to the positive terminal of the good battery.

7. Connect the black (negative) clamp to the negative terminal of the good battery.

8. Attach the other black clamp to an unpainted metal surface (e.g. bolt, bracket) on the engine of the car with the dead battery, at least a few inches away from the battery. If a labeled remote negative terminal is available, use it.

9. Confirm that the jumper cables are not near any moving engine parts.

10. Start the booster car, and let it idle for 5 minutes to build up a charge in the dead battery. This will take longer if the dead battery is really empty.

11. Start the car with the dead battery and let the two vehicles idle for a few minutes. If the car doesn’t start, wait a few more minutes and try again. In some instances, slightly revving the engine of the running car while charging the dead battery may help. If it still doesn’t start, it probably won’t.

12. Disconnect the jumper cables reversing the connection order, making sure no disconnected clamps touch any metal or each other

13. Drive the jump-started car for at least 20-30 minutes so it can recharge the battery
Try to keep the jumper cables with you; you may need to jump again the next time you start the car."

You have been placed in the position of supporting the 2010 Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission.  Please develop your position into a one-page position paper (12-point font, single spaced).

### Response:
","The Citizens United case is ultimately one pertaining to freedom of speech—while undeniable to US citizens, the protection of free speech was previously denied to unions and corporations. Now, they can express support or criticism of political candidates. This should be good news for both dominant political parties, as liberals tending to support unions and conservatives tending to laud free enterprise both have great voice in the election process. Concern, however, has been raised that companies now have too loud a voice.
But, who makes up companies? Individual humans, who are free to join and leave those companies at will. Why would a group of humans be devoid of any rights to which the individuals of the group are entitled? The constitutional right to free speech, it follows, applies to groups of individuals – which companies are – and those groups should be able to leverage their earned dollars to further promote their own well-being. And the ruling has legal precedent: dating back to 1868, US corporations have enjoyed equal protection under the 14th amendment and protection against search and seizure without warrant (Totenberg, N.)
But the decision cannot be analyzed solely through legal theory. What have the actual impacts been since the ruling? Rather than observing unlimited spending from corporations as feared, the last ten years have reemphasized the importance of low-level donors; instead of focusing power on just one party or candidate that certain corporations back, political parties have taken turns assuming power; corporate donations remain under 10% of total political spending at the federal level. Furthermore, it seems that wealthy individuals, rather than any specific union or corporation, have been making oversized donations that dominant the budgets of super-PACs. It follows that any concerns around voices dominating the political conversation are indeed individuals, not unions or corporations as fear.
Citizens United allows companies to further act in their best interests and raise issues pertaining to the business. US citizens can and should be trusted to consume rhetoric intellectually, instead of shielded from the arguments companies are making."

What is the difference between tennis shoes and sandals?

### Response:
","Tennis shoes are a form of footware that fully covers and supports your feet. These shoes are designed to endure a lot of wear and tear, as they are often used for physical activity and general daily use. Tennis shoes typically have full heal support that limits the movement of your foot within the shoe as you wear them. Tennis shoes also have laces, which help the wearer to tighten the shoe fabric around your foot, providing further support. Sandals are a type of footware that does not fully cover or support your foot. Sandals typically have some sort of wrap or toe fixture that helps to keep the shoe on the wearer as they walk. This type of shoe is mostly used for short-term wear, at the beach, or at the pool, as they are extremely convenient to put on and take off."

","Rowing is the sport of racing boats using oars. It differs from paddling sports in that rowing oars are attached to the boat using oarlocks, while paddles are not connected to the boat. Rowing is divided into two disciplines: sculling and sweep rowing. In sculling, each rower holds two oars—one in each hand, while in sweep rowing each rower holds one oar with both hands. There are several boat classes in which athletes may compete, ranging from single sculls, occupied by one person, to shells with eight rowers and a coxswain, called eights. There are a wide variety of course types and formats of racing, but most elite and championship level racing is conducted on calm water courses 2 kilometres long with several lanes marked using buoys."

How to get an efficient cardio workout and improve your speed, and gain other health benefits?

### Response:
","In this day and age when many are busy with work, family, electronic gadgets, social media it becomes increasingly challenging to find the time to exercise.  Staying healthy will allow you to enjoy those distractions longer, but jokes aside it will make you feel energized, motivated and bring out the best in you.  When new discoveries in scenic areas are correctly applied, you don’t need to spend multiple hours at the gym, you don’t have to starve to achieve your goals, this concept was very enticing to me when I first learnt about the Sprint 8 program at my local gym.  I decided to give this a try!

Sprint 8 - Its a 20 minute routine, where you spend the first 30 seconds working out at the highest level of intensity (go all out) followed by 90 seconds of active recovery, repeat this 8 times..  You can use a bike, treadmill, elliptical whichever suits your style.  In all my life of being fairly active, Sprint 8 has the toughest workout, but over a year I could see significant results.  I was able to run faster, lower blood pressure, reduce fat percentage, and improve muscle mass.  The key differentiator about this program is that it engages all the three muscle fiber types and releases exercise induced growth hormones to help your body become stronger, leaner and healthier.

Another advantage is that this program really reduces any change of injury that one may face by running, heavy weight lifting etc therefore allowing you to sustain the exercise program for years to come.  

Give this a try and gain the benefits of efficient exercising."

Should heritage trees in Palo Alto be protected once they become a danger to people and homes?

### Response:
","Strong winds driven, likely driven by climate change,  are posing new challenges to tree protection ordinances in northern California cities like Palo Alto, California. Climate change has caused stronger winds to occur in SF Bay Area. These strong gusts, some of which can be over 60 mph, are causing large, historic trees to fall onto houses threatening costly real estate as well as peoples lives. In the city of Palo Alto, California Oaks and Redwoods are classified as heritage trees. These majestic trees grow throughout the city and for many years have been vigilantly protected.  These trees are considered part of the city's unique character and history, therefore a part of its heritage.  Heritage trees cannot be cut down without the permission of a special city governance body and getting this okay to do so is very hard if not impossible to do.  The trees are beautiful and protecting them is noble, but  in the new era of unprecedented high winds some residents are asking if  their protection should be reconsidered given the risk they present to people and their homes during a storm. 

While storms are dramatic and do cause damage, they also occur infrequently and are a natural part of life.  Heritage oak and redwood trees which take hundreds of years to grow do pose some risks to homes and people should they fall, but overall they pose an insignificant risk to humans and buildings and need to continue to be protected in order to continue to provide their many benefits to humans."

Describe a trip through the United States for a 14 day vacation in a rental car

### Response:
","The about 14 days trip through the United States starts at Las Vegas. You can easily get a direct flight from Europe to Las Vegas in the States. That makes an easy start for your trip. As you start in Las Vegas take some time to adjust and adapt to the scenery. There are a lot of things to do and see in Las Vegas itself. For example, take a walk along the strip to see all the hotels and casinos, even get inside of one - the Caesars Palace or the Venetian are very interesting. Also there are a lot of show offerings such as Cirque du Soleil or parties in the evening, if you want to have good seats it's best to book your tickets in advance before you start your trip. As you strolled through the city of Las Vegas for two days, on the third day it's time to pick up your rental car. With your rental car begins your road trip through the wide streets of the United states. The first goal for your trip will be Zion Nationalpark in Utah, about a 3 hours drive from Las Vegas. In this national park you have the chance to hike and wander around beautiful nature. One of the most impressive hikes is called Angels Landing. At the highest point of this hike you have a beautiful overview of the whole national park. But be aware that it is necessary to book your ticket for this trail way in advance or if you want to do it on short notice you have to have luck in the lottery. Otherwise you are not allowed to hike this trail. That restriction is necessary because too many people hiked the trail and it became dangerous, so numbers of hikers had to be limited a day. If you spend two day exploring the landscape of Zion Nationalpark it's time to move on to the next location, which is Bryce Canyon National Park also in Utah. It takes around two to 3 hours to drive there from Zion. The area right before the Nationalpark is small with some restaurants, hotels, motels or campgrounds. The Canyon itself is huge and will give you a lot of opportunity to explore. In the wintertime it can be very cold and snowy, therefore bring warm clothes. In the two days you spend there you can visit beautiful overviews on the edge of the canyon and also hike down and explore the deeper canyon. One of the highlights is the amphitheater or Thors' hammer. It is also recommended to watch the sun rise over Bryce Canyon because it's more spectacular from the colors than the sunset in the evening. From Bryce Canyon Nationalpark the road trip continues to the city of Page in Arizona from where you can visit the Antelope Canyon. Take at least one full day there to discover either the upper or the lower Antelope Canyon. But be aware, you have to book tickets in advance! If you don't get a ticket for them there is also Antelope Canyon X, which is a real alternative to visit and maybe even less crowded then the other ones. From this point of the tour you then drive to Grand Canyon National Park, which will take about 3 hours at least. This is probably the highlight of the National Parks in this area of the United States. Recommended is to stay at least for two days, even better if you have more time. You should take one trail down the canyon if you are in the physical state to do this. One most common way down is the south Kalib trail which has a beautiful viewpoint called Ooh Aah Point. If you want to watch the sunset in the evening the desert view watchpoint is a great way to do so. Also take some time to stroll around at Grand Canyon Village, there are some nice souvenir shops and more. From Grand Canyon National Park the road trip then moves on to the last target location, which is Los Angeles in California. It's a longer drive there and takes around 8 hours to drive there. But once you arrive there you will have some nice, relaxing days before your flight back home to Frankfurt. You can spend one day visiting Santa Monica, the beach and the Pier there. It's nice to rent a bicycle out there and ride along the beach side through Venice Beach up to Hermosa beach or even further if you like. Another activity could be to visit Dolby Theatre and the Walk of Fame in Hollywood, there are a lot of shops out there or you can just stroll along. But one thing to be aware of when visiting Los Angeles with a car is that there is always traffic and you can be stuck in traffic many times. As Los Angeles is the last stop on the proposed US-trip on your last day it is time to bring back your rental car right before you fly back, just bring it to the rental car stores at the LAX airport. From this airport you will board your flight back to Europe or somewhere else."

According to the text below, what is a block?
Block (data storage)

In computing (specifically data transmission and data storage), a block,[1] sometimes called a physical record, is a sequence of bytes or bits, usually containing some whole number of records, having a maximum length; a block size.[2] Data thus structured are said to be blocked. The process of putting data into blocks is called blocking, while deblocking is the process of extracting data from blocks. Blocked data is normally stored in a data buffer, and read or written a whole block at a time. Blocking reduces the overhead and speeds up the handling of the data stream.[3] For some devices, such as magnetic tape and CKD disk devices, blocking reduces the amount of external storage required for the data. Blocking is almost universally employed when storing data to 9-track magnetic tape, NAND flash memory, and rotating media such as floppy disks, hard disks, and optical discs.

Most file systems are based on a block device, which is a level of abstraction for the hardware responsible for storing and retrieving specified blocks of data, though the block size in file systems may be a multiple of the physical block size. This leads to space inefficiency due to internal fragmentation, since file lengths are often not integer multiples of block size, and thus the last block of a file may remain partially empty. This will create slack space. Some newer file systems, such as Btrfs and FreeBSD UFS2, attempt to solve this through techniques called block suballocation and tail merging. Other file systems such as ZFS support variable block sizes.[4][5]

Block storage is normally abstracted by a file system or database management system (DBMS) for use by applications and end users. The physical or logical volumes accessed via block I/O may be devices internal to a server, directly attached via SCSI or Fibre Channel, or distant devices accessed via a storage area network (SAN) using a protocol such as iSCSI, or AoE. DBMSes often use their own block I/O for improved performance and recoverability as compared to layering the DBMS on top of a file system.

What is transistor technology?
Long before any knowledge of electricity existed, people were aware of shocks from electric fish. Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the ""Thunderer of the Nile"", and described them as the ""protectors"" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.
Ancient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing.
Thales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.
Electricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New Latin word electricus (""of amber"" or ""like amber"",, elektron, the Greek word for ""amber"") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words ""electric"" and ""electricity"", which made their first appearance in print in Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646.
Further work was conducted in the 17th and early 18th centuries by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. Later in the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges
In 1775, Hugh Williamson reported a series of experiments to the Royal Society on the shocks delivered by the electric eel; that same year the surgeon and anatomist John Hunter described the structure of the fish's electric organs. In 1791, Luigi Galvani published his discovery of bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles. Alessandro Volta's battery, or voltaic pile, of 1800, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to Hans Christian Ørsted and André-Marie Ampère in 1819–1820. Michael Faraday invented the electric motor in 1821, and Georg Ohm mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in 1827. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by James Clerk Maxwell, in particular in his ""On Physical Lines of Force"" in 1861 and 1862. 
While the early 19th century had seen rapid progress in electrical science, the late 19th century would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as Alexander Graham Bell, Ottó Bláthy, Thomas Edison, Galileo Ferraris, Oliver Heaviside, Ányos Jedlik, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Charles Algernon Parsons, Werner von Siemens, Joseph Swan, Reginald Fessenden, Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.
In 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for ""his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect"". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels.
The first solid-state device was the ""cat's-whisker detector"" first used in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.
Solid-state electronics came into its own with the emergence of transistor technology. The first working transistor, a germanium-based point-contact transistor, was invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain at Bell Labs in 1947, followed by the bipolar junction transistor in 1948.

Write a diary entry about a mother discovering the greatness she sees growing in her middle-school aged daughter.  Contrast the kindness of the daughter against the difficulties the mother is experiencing at work that day.  Infuse the story with love and admiration.

### Response:
","So today I went to Maddie’s class to be the lunch monitor.  She’s in 9th grade, but attends a pretty small school, so everyone was milling about in a small area…playing cards or MahJong, eating baked goods they got from a sale down the hall, and generally, being teenagers. 
I don’t frequent her school often, but Mads seemed pretty happy, and in her element.  It was lovely to witness.
I, on the other hand, was having a Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day at work, and when I arrived, I was checking my phone for updates and trying to fight a battle for my new team that I was told was Very Much Not Worth Fighting.  Of course, this was unheeded advice, as—if there’s a hill that’s worth dying on—I will go prostrate myself upon the top of it as effectively as possible. 
And so I was fighting an Unwinnable War, and my daughter was overseeing a team of boys scarfing down brownies and picking at their healthy lunches and laughing whilst stacking their Chinese tiles…and I was so crestfallen about the outcome of my silent, onscreen, remote work battle that I didn’t even notice the tears welling up in my eyes, or the fact that I was sitting in the middle of a room filled with teenagers. 
I suppose the only good thing about crying in a room full of teenagers at lunch is that you’re very rarely the ONLY one crying…so there’s that.
So there I sat, in fine company, shoulders mildly hunched and trying my damnedest not to wipe my now-soggy nose on my sleeve.  And of course maintaining a smile any time Maddie looked over at me, because Lord knows I was there only to make sure no one flipped over a table (but honestly, not there for much else, as these kids were self-sufficient and rather shockingly well-behaved from what I remembered from 9th grade) and the last thing I wanted was to embarrass my daughter at her school lunch hour.
But Maddie was standing there next to the little sofa chair I was on, and she said, “Mom, scoot over.” 
And I scooted.
And she sat. 
She didn’t ask me what was wrong; she already had heard my rumblings before she left for school this morning about the particular work woe I was dealing with today.  Rather, she leaned over and gave me a big hug, right there in front of anyone paying attention—which seemed to be everyone—and assuaged me with soothing “it will all be fine”s and “didn’t I expect these kind of things from my work by now anyway?”s. 
And then she got up and went back to her perch at the game table, as nonchalantly as if she had just gotten a drink at the water fountain, and I was left thinking that my teenage daughter had just hugged me in public, in the high school lunch room, in front of two dozen other teenagers I had never met, and she didn’t even flinch. 
Three hours later, the issue at work actually ended up coming up roses;  turns out that dying on that Hill was able to save the initiative after all.   I was really, really happy about that.
But the best part of the day was the undeniable recognition that Maddie is Fearless, and Kind, and Confident, and willing to step across lines and do the hard things. She is going to be a Force of Nature. 
Indeed, she already is."

If your child has been told that he or she has lice, what should you do?

### Response:
","The first thing is to buy a shampoo that is made to kill the lice.  Lice only live on human scalps, and they lay tiny white eggs called nits.  Once lice and/or nits are visually identified, immediately use the lice shampoo to thoroughly wash and clean the hair and scalp of your child.  After the cleaning, carefully comb out the hair with a special nit comb, which has metal teeth very close together to most effectively get rid of the lice and the eggs.  After shampooing and combing out, make sure to wash all bedding and any other furniture or rugs where there may have been head-to-fabric contact.  Pillows and bedding must also be washed; if washing is not possible, then put the objects or fabrics in a plastic bag and store in a closet or garage for two weeks.  

Check for any itching after cleaning and combing out the hair, and re-apply the shampoo if either lice or eggs are detected again."

Why is the sky blue?

### Response:
","All the light in our daytime sky comes from the sun, and our sun produces light in many different colors. To understand this, just think of a prism.  White light enters, and a rainbow of colors exits. Our sun is like that. Its light may seem uniform but it is actually emitting many different colors.

Our sky though is not a mix of blue and red and green because the earth's atmosphere is sandwiched between the sun and us, getting in the way. Atmospheric gases and particles scatter the incoming colors, bouncing them in all different directions.  The amount of scattering increases as the wavelength of light decreases.  Red light which has a long wavelength is scattered much less than blue light which has a short wavelength. As blue is scattered more, it fills our daytime sky.

As the sun traverses the sky and moves low on the horizon, the light that reaches our eyes must actually travel further through the atmosphere.  This has the effect of completely bouncing away all the blue light.  We are left with the reds and yellows and oranges in wonderful mixture, making sunrises and sunsets so beautiful."

Suggest an allocation to implement a three portfolio strategy as described in the text below
A three-fund portfolio is based on the fundamental asset classes, stocks and bonds. It is assumed that cash is not counted within the investment portfolio, so it is not included. On the other hand, it is assumed that every investor should hold both domestic and international stocks. The task, then, is to take these three basic non-cash assets — domestic stocks, international stocks, and bonds — decide how much of each to hold (your asset allocation); choose where to hold each of these asset classes, and finally choose a mutual fund to use for each asset class.

### Response:
","From Vanguard's list of ""core funds,"" the funds that are best for a three-fund portfolio are:

Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX)
Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund (VTIAX)
Vanguard Total Bond Market Fund (VBTLX)
So, a ""three-fund portfolio"" might consist of 42% Total Stock Market Index, 18% Total International Stock Index, and 40% Total Bond Market fund."

How can I become a better runner?

### Response:
","There are a few things you can do to become a better runner:

1. Train consistently - Endurance running creates physiological adaptations which take a long time for you to notice. Try to run at least 3 or 4 times a week for at least 30 minutes to begin building those adaptations. 
2. Get enough sleep - studies show that muscles recover better if you get at least 8 hours of sleep each night.
3. Fuel your body - you can't gain muscle if you don't provide your body with enough calories to keep yourself fueled. Ensure that you are eating a good mix of protein, carbohydrates, and vegetables to set yourself up for success.
4. Don't overtrain - One common mistake new runners make is to run more than they are trained to manage and end up injuring yourself. You can't build fitness if you are off of training due to injury!"

Please provide a brief history of coffee
The history of coffee dates back to centuries of old oral tradition in modern day Ethiopia. However, neither where coffee was first cultivated nor direct evidence of its consumption prior to the 15th century have been found. Sufi monasteries in Yemen employed coffee as an aid to concentration during prayers. Coffee later spread to the Levant and Persia in the early 16th century; it caused some controversy on whether it was halal in Ottoman and Mamluk society. Coffee arrived in Italy the second half of the 16th century through commercial Mediterranean trade routes, while Central and Eastern Europeans learnt of coffee from the Ottomans. By the mid 17th century, it had reached India and the East Indies. Coffee houses would establish themselves in Western Europe by the late 17th century, especially in England and Germany. One of the earliest cultivations of coffee in the New World was when Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings to Martinique in 1720. These beans later sprouted 18,680 coffee trees which enabled its spread to other Caribbean islands like Saint-Domingue and also to Mexico. By 1788, Saint-Domingue supplied half the world's coffee. By 1852, globally, Brazil became the largest producer of coffee and has held that status ever since. The period since 1950 saw the widening of the playing field due to the emergence of several other major producers, notably Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and Vietnam; the latter overtook Colombia and became the second-largest producer in 1999. Modern production techniques along with the mass productization of coffee has made it a household item today.

What are the examples of  quantum tunneling processes?
Apart from fission induced by a neutron, harnessed and exploited by humans, a natural form of spontaneous radioactive decay (not requiring a neutron) is also referred to as fission, and occurs especially in very high-mass-number isotopes. Spontaneous fission was discovered in 1940 by Flyorov, Petrzhak, and Kurchatov[5] in Moscow, in an experiment intended to confirm that, without bombardment by neutrons, the fission rate of uranium was negligible, as predicted by Niels Bohr; it was not negligible.[5]

The unpredictable composition of the products (which vary in a broad probabilistic and somewhat chaotic manner) distinguishes fission from purely quantum tunneling processes such as proton emission, alpha decay, and cluster decay, which give the same products each time. Nuclear fission produces energy for nuclear power and drives the explosion of nuclear weapons. Both uses are possible because certain substances called nuclear fuels undergo fission when struck by fission neutrons, and in turn emit neutrons when they break apart. This makes a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction possible, releasing energy at a controlled rate in a nuclear reactor or at a very rapid, uncontrolled rate in a nuclear weapon.

The amount of free energy contained in nuclear fuel is millions of times the amount of free energy contained in a similar mass of chemical fuel such as gasoline, making nuclear fission a very dense source of energy. The products of nuclear fission, however, are on average far more radioactive than the heavy elements which are normally fissioned as fuel, and remain so for significant amounts of time, giving rise to a nuclear waste problem. However, the seven long-lived fission products make up only a small fraction of fission products. Neutron absorption which does not lead to fission produces Plutonium (from 238
U) and minor actinides (from both 235
U and 238
U) whose radiotoxicity is far higher than that of the long lived fission products. Concerns over nuclear waste accumulation and the destructive potential of nuclear weapons are a counterbalance to the peaceful desire to use fission as an energy source. The thorium fuel cycle produces virtually no plutonium and much less minor actinides, but 232
U - or rather its decay products - are a major gamma ray emitter. All actinides are fertile or fissile and fast breeder reactors can fission them all albeit only in certain configurations. Nuclear reprocessing aims to recover usable material from spent nuclear fuel to both enable uranium (and thorium) supplies to last longer and to reduce the amount of ""waste"". The industry term for a process that fissions all or nearly all actinides is a ""closed fuel cycle"".

Why do Jewish holidays begin at sunset the night before?

### Response:
","In many modern cultures and calendars, days begin in the morning and end at night.  But what if the opposite were true?   In the opening lines of the Creation story in the book of Genesis, the foundational story for all Abrahamic cultures, we learn that all the world was darkness and void.  (Darkness came first.) And then God said ""Let there be light.""  (Light came second.)  ""And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day."" 

This last sentence is critical. The first day consists of evening followed by morning. The Jewish calendar abides by this tradition.  Its days are not morning to morning. Its days are night to night (as marked by sundown).  

As an example, the Jewish sabbath (Shabbat) is on the 7th day of the week. Shabbat = Shevat in Hebrew, which literally translates to the number seven.  The seventh day of the  week is is Saturday. However, Shabbat doesn't span Saturday morning to Sunday morning. It spans Friday night to Saturday night.  Many observant Jews will welcome the Shabbat with a family meal, candles, and prayer on Friday nights."

What are the two World Championships in one season of Formula One?
Formula One (more commonly known as Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class of international racing for open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The FIA Formula One World Championship has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950. The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules to which all participants' cars must conform.[1] A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix. Grands Prix take place in multiple countries and continents around the world on either purpose-built circuits or closed public roads. A points system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World Championships: one for the drivers, and one for the constructors (the teams). Each driver must hold a valid Super Licence, the highest class of racing licence issued by the FIA,[2] and the races must be held on tracks graded ""1"", the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA for tracks.

From the passage provided, extract the two forms of energy transfer and list them in bullets.
The First Law of thermodynamics is a formulation of the law of conservation of energy, adapted for thermodynamic processes. A simple formulation is: ""The total energy in a system remains constant, although it may be converted from one form to another."" Another common phrasing is that ""energy can neither be created nor destroyed"" (in a ""closed system""). While there are many subtleties and implications that may be more precisely captured in more complex formulations, this is the essential principle of the First Law.

It distinguishes in principle two forms of energy transfer: heat, and thermodynamic work, for a system of a constant amount of matter. The law also defines the internal energy of a system, an extensive property for taking account of the balance of energies in the system.

### Response:
","The two forms of energy transfer are:
- Heat
- Thermodynamic work"

Who was the most prolific religious leader ever?

### Response:
","Some know him as Zoroaster and others as Zarathustra. He lived between the 18th and 16th century BCE. The reputed founder of Zoroastrianism, he started the major religion of the Persian Empire. This empire flourished from 550 BCE to 330 BCE.

Nobody knows his birthplace. But many Arabic sources claim he got born in modern Azerbaijan. To this day, so many countries have tried to lay claim to his birthplace, that we might think he was not a single person.

Followers worshiped Ahura Mazda, the Supreme Being or God of Zoroastrianism. While the religion has gone extinct, we have to note it influenced so many ancient civilizations. Zoroastrianism influenced Classic Greek philosophy, Roman teachings, and many more.

There are still some people practicing Zoroastrianism, namely in India."

In a concise bulleted list, tell me what audiologists do when they are seeing a patient
Audiology (from Latin audīre, ""to hear""; and from Greek -λογία, -logia) is a branch of science that studies hearing, balance, and related disorders.[1] Audiologists treat those with hearing loss and proactively prevent related damage. By employing various testing strategies (e.g. behavioral hearing tests, otoacoustic emission measurements, and electrophysiologic tests), audiologists aim to determine whether someone has normal sensitivity to sounds. If hearing loss is identified, audiologists determine which portions of hearing (high, middle, or low frequencies) are affected, to what degree (severity of loss), and where the lesion causing the hearing loss is found (outer ear, middle ear, inner ear, auditory nerve and/or central nervous system). If an audiologist determines that a hearing loss or vestibular abnormality is present, they will provide recommendations for interventions or rehabilitation (e.g. hearing aids, cochlear implants, appropriate medical referrals).

### Response:
","* Audiologists aim to determine whether someone has normal sensitivity to sounds.

","Margaret Thatcher was the first woman to be elected prime minister of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, serving in this role from her first election victory in 1979 until she was forced out of office by members of her own party in 1990. During this time she transformed the economic situation in the United Kingdom by introducing economic policies intended to reverse high inflation and weak growth. By constraining the power of trades unions and overseeing extensive deregulation and privatisation, Thatcher helped to create a period of extended growth and economic success. Together with Ronald Reagan, she was also instrumental in recognising and supporting the opportunity to end communist rule in the Soviet Union, where she was dubbed the 'Iron Lady', through her friendship with the Russian leader, Mikhail Gorbachev. Her legacy was to end the so-called 'post-war consensus' in the UK (characterised by high taxes, regulation and nationalisation) and to replace it with policies that encouraged free-enterprise and personal responsibility while acknowledging the importance of the welfare state, provided it was administered responsibly. Although disliked by many on the left for the way that she challenged excessive union power, she is generally acknowledged as the most important British politician of the late twentieth century."

Which drum kit should I buy?

### Response:
","To decide which drum kit to buy, ultimately you should consider where you are in your drumming journey, and where you see yourself going in the coming years. If you're just starting out then there are some excellent starter choices from most of the major brands. For example, Tama and Pearl.
If you're an intermediate drummer who is starting to play gigs and record, then buying a mid-range kit with solid hardware and a variety colour options & finishes could be a good match for you. 
If you're a professional drummer who is playing many gigs, doing recording sessions etc then a reliable high end kit with a lot of range and tuning options will be a must have. Here you will consider options such as the DW Collectors series, the Tama Starclassic and Star series, Yamaha Recording Customs, Pearl Masters, Sonos SQ2's and Gretsch USA Customs."

How many inhabitants of Lone Pine survived as a result of the earthquake? Tell me how you came to that conclusion.
The earthquake occurred on a Tuesday morning and leveled almost all the buildings in Lone Pine and nearby settlements.[4] Of the estimated 250–300 inhabitants of Lone Pine, 27 are known to have perished and 52 of the 59 houses were destroyed. One report states that the main buildings were thrown down in almost every town in Inyo County. About 130 kilometers (81 mi) south of Lone Pine, at Indian Wells, adobe houses sustained cracks. Property loss has been estimated at $250,000 (equivalent to $5,654,861 in 2021). As in many earthquakes, adobe, stone and masonry structures fared worse than wooden ones which prompted the closing of nearby Camp Independence which was an adobe structure destroyed in the quake.

### Response:
","It is estimated that between 223 and 273 inhabitants of Lone Pine survived the earthquake.

The passage shows that there was ""an estimated 250–300 inhabitants of Lone Pine"" and that ""27 are known to have perished"". If we subtract 27 from 250, you get 223, and if we subtract 27 from 300, we get 273. Therefore, it can be estimated that the number of inhabitants that survived the earthquake is between 223 and 273."

Onigiri (お握り or 御握り), also known as omusubi (お結び), nigirimeshi (握り飯), or rice ball, is a Japanese food made from white rice formed into triangular or cylindrical shapes and often wrapped in nori.[a] Traditionally, an onigiri is filled with pickled ume (umeboshi), salted salmon, katsuobushi, kombu, tarako, mentaiko, takanazuke (pickled takana, Japanese giant red mustard greens) or any other salty or sour ingredient as a natural preservative. Most Japanese convenience stores stock their onigiri with various fillings and flavors. There are even specialized shops which only sell onigiri to take out. Due to the popularity of this trend in Japan, onigiri has become a popular staple in Japanese restaurants worldwide.

Write a review of Carlos Ruiz Zafon's book The Shadow of the Wind

### Response:
","What a beautiful book; it reminds me of Murakami - magical yet still very grounded. The Shadow of the Wind has everything going for it: mystical Barcelona, heartwarming characters, poetic language, intriguing plot.

The language and setting of the book was amazing. Zafon is extremely talented, his words are elegant and poetic, and he paints Barcelona in a myriad of different ways: dark and gothic at night, or blissfully cheerful, or dreary gloom, all depending on the characters.

I loved the cast of Shadow of the Wind. Each character was well developed and given an appropriate backstory. They bumped into each other in mysterious turns, and their interactions, like Daniel and Clara, or Daniel and Nuria, were heart wrenching.

But most of all, Zafon tells a wonderful story. I loved the parallels between Julian Carax and Daniel, and how Daniel's life becomes entangled with Julian's. It makes it feel much more like magical realism, and makes for an entertaining read."

What type of cheeses can you use to make a grilled cheese sandwich.
A grilled cheese sandwich is made by placing a cheese filling, often cheddar or American cheese, between two slices of bread, which is then heated until the bread browns and the cheese melts. A layer of butter or mayonnaise may be added to the outside of the bread for additional flavor and texture. Alternatives may include additional ingredients, such as meat, peppers, tomatoes, or onions.[3] Methods for heating the sandwich include cooking on a griddle, fried in a pan, or using a panini grill or sandwich toaster, the latter method more common in the United Kingdom, where the sandwiches are normally called ""toasted sandwiches"" or ""toasties"", in Australia, where they are called ""jaffles"" or ""toasted sandwiches"", and South Africa, where they are called “snackwiches”. Other methods include baking in an oven or toaster oven — or in a toasting bag in an electric toaster.

","Common cheeses to make a grilled cheese are cheddar or American cheese, although you are not limited to those cheeses.  Depending on a persons preferences there are a large variety of cheeses that are well suited for a grilled cheese sandwich.

Where can I go to request an absentee ballot for an upcoming election in Wisconsin, or to track the status of my ballot request?

### Response:
","The MyVote.wi.gov site has several resources to help Wisconsin voters.  One resource allows you to enter in your name and birth date and request an absentee ballot.  You should plan to do this well in advance of the election.  Once you have submitted your request, you can track whether the ballot has been sent or received through the website.  Not only do you have to complete the ballot correctly in advance, but you must also have it properly witnessed, and you witness must correctly complete their section of the ballot.  Additionally, your ballot must be received by election day.  Ballots received after the election date will not be counted--regardless of whether the delay was the responsibility of the postal service.   If you are concerned that there is not enough time for the postal service to return the ballot on time, you can drop off your absentee ballot in person at your polling site on the day of the election, or you can simply vote in person at the polling site.  Your ballot cannot be turned in by another person to the polling site.  This website is provided by the Wisconsin Elections Commission, which is a bipartisan commission charged with implementing Wisconsin's election statutes."

Write a short story about a botanist who discovers a part of a forest where plants are communicating with each other.

### Response:
","Anya was a college student studying botany, and was tasked with identifying a broad range of fungi in a local forest. Since she also enjoyed camping, she decided to go deep into the forest during a long weekend to complete her assignment. 

As she got deeper into the forest, away from civilization, the tree cover became thicker, and therefore the floor of the forest became darker. ""Perfect for fungi growth!"" she thought. She started seeing more and more fungi, some on the trees, some on rotting logs, and some on the forest floor. Peculiarly, most of the fungi she began to see as she got deeper in the forest were green, which was quite unusual.

She catalogued all the fungi she saw for the next several days. On her way out, she took the same path she came in on, but noticed that the fungi along her path had changed to possess typical colors of fungi, not the green she had seen when she came in. She explored perpendicular to her path, and found a slowly changing range of colors, until she saw the same green she had seen when she came in.

She needed to return to school, but decided to come back the next weekend.

When she arrived back into the fungi's domain, she saw something breathtaking as she explored. Everywhere she had gone, a ripple of colors seemed to have formed. The fungi had reacted to her presence, and sent signals to the other fungi in the area, where the signal had been propagated. Some of the fungi on her original path had even returned to the original green color she had observed upon entering the forest. She also noticed the local fauna completely avoided the areas where the fungi had changed from its original green color. It seemed as though the fungi had developed a warning system for the forest to detect humans!"

Dionysus (Διόνυσος, Diónusos)/Bacchus (Βάκχος, Bákkhos)

God of wine, fruitfulness, parties, festivals, madness, chaos, drunkenness, vegetation, ecstasy, and the theater. He is the twice-born son of Zeus and Semele, in that Zeus snatched him from his mother's womb and stitched Dionysus into his own thigh and carried him until he was ready to be born. In art he is depicted as either an older bearded god (particularly before 430 BC) or an effeminate, long-haired youth (particularly after 430 BC). His attributes include the thyrsus, a drinking cup, the grape vine, and a crown of ivy. He is often in the company of his thiasos, a group of attendants including satyrs, maenads, and his old tutor Silenus. The consort of Dionysus was Ariadne. It was once held that Dionysius was a later addition to the Greek pantheon, but the discovery of Linear B tablets confirm his status as a deity from an early period. Bacchus was another name for him in Greek, and came into common usage among the Romans.[7] His sacred animals include dolphins, serpents, tigers, and donkeys.

The New Deal included new constraints and safeguards on the banking industry and efforts to re-inflate the economy after prices had fallen sharply. New Deal programs included both laws passed by Congress as well as presidential executive orders during the first term of the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt.

The programs focused on what historians refer to as the ""3 R's"": relief for the unemployed and for the poor, recovery of the economy back to normal levels, and reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression.[1] The New Deal produced a political realignment, making the Democratic Party the majority (as well as the party that held the White House for seven out of the nine presidential terms from 1933 to 1969) with its base in progressive ideas, the South, big city machines and the newly empowered labor unions, and various ethnic groups. The Republicans were split, with progressive Republicans in support but conservatives opposing the entire New Deal as hostile to business and economic growth. The realignment crystallized into the New Deal coalition that dominated presidential elections into the 1960s while the opposing conservative coalition largely controlled Congress in domestic affairs from 1937 to 1964.

### Response:
","The ""3 R's"" historians refer to are the following:
- Relief for the unemployed and for the poor

Given this reference text, tell me what the foundational BJJ concept was
Brazilian jiu-jitsu was initially developed in 1925 by Brazilian brothers Carlos, Oswaldo, Gastão Jr., George, and Hélio Gracie, after Carlos was taught jiu-jitsu by a travelling Japanese judoka, Mitsuyo Maeda, who himself mastered his ground fighting while interacting with Taro Miyake (Tanabe student), Sadakazu Uyenishi (Handa, Tanabe) and Yukio Tani (Tenjin Shinyo-ryu) and catch wrestlers in Europe. Later on, the Gracie family developed their own self-defense system, and published Gracie Jiu-Jitsu.

BJJ eventually came to be its own defined combat sport through the innovations, practices, and adaptation of Gracie jiu-jitsu and Judo, and became an essential martial art for modern MMA. Governing bodies such as the IBJJF work worldwide, and set the rules and standards to be held in sport BJJ competitions.

BJJ revolves around the concept, taken from traditional Japanese jūjutsu, that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend themselves against a bigger, stronger, heavier opponent by using leverage and weight distribution, taking the fight to the ground and using a number of holds and submissions to defeat them. BJJ training can be used for sport grappling and self-defense situations.[3] Sparring, commonly referred to as ""rolling"" within the BJJ community, and live drilling plays a major role in training and the practitioner's development. BJJ can also be used as a method of promoting physical fitness, building character, and as a way of life.[4][5]

### Response:
","BJJ focuses on the concept that smaller and weaker practitioners can defend against larger and bigger opponents by taking the fight to the ground. Once on the ground, a BJJ practitioner can use leverage and weight distribution to defeat their opponent."

What are some sound personal financial practices to employ in the modern economy?

### Response:
","Although this is a vast topic there are some widely accepted best practices guidance for personal financial practices in the modern economy.  Generally speaking, individuals should first keep track of what income and expenses they have.  This often requires noting down monthly income and expenses in a spreadsheet.  Once we have an understanding of our monthly income and expenses we can then create a budget.  A budget is a financial plan meant to help us understand how much we can spend between paychecks and how much we can save.  If we have any high interest debt or any debt, the loan or bill with the highest accruing interest, that becomes the first priority for us to spend our budget on after we account for our expenses.  These are some sound personal financial practices to employ and we should try to keep our expenses and debt as low as we can while maximizing our income and savings as a general practice."

Do I need diverter to charge my car using excess generated power from solar panels?

### Response:
","The need for a separate Solar PV diverter depends mostly on your EVSE (car charger). Some chargers already come with the capability to intelligently divert any extra power from your solar panels by monitoring your grid connection or a combination of solar panel output and your house consumption. Smart EVSE still requires the installation by a licensed electrician, but the overall system is much simpler than the alternatives.

Car chargers, which do not support monitoring your electrical grid, may still allow controlling the charging by an external system, but complicates the overall setup and requires multiple modules to work together to achieve the goal.

Car chargers, which neither can monitor the grid and doesn't support external control of the charging current, may not work well even with a Solar PV diverter depending on the mode of operation of the Solar PV diverter and the design of the car charger."

The Seattle area is the cloudiest region of the United States, due in part to frequent storms and lows moving in from the adjacent Pacific Ocean. With many more ""rain days"" than other major American cities, Seattle has a well-earned reputation for frequent rain. In an average year, at least 0.01 inches (0.25 mm) of precipitation falls on 150 days, more than nearly all U.S. cities east of the Rocky Mountains. However, because it often has merely a light drizzle falling from the sky for many days, Seattle actually receives significantly less rainfall (or other precipitation) overall than many other U.S. cities like New York City, Miami, or Houston. Seattle is cloudy 201 days out of the year and partly cloudy 93 days.

Who is Frank Lloyd Wright, and why is he famous?
Frank Lloyd Wright (June 8, 1867 – April 9, 1959) was an American architect, designer, writer, and educator.

He designed more than 1,000 structures over a creative period of 70 years. Wright played a key role in the architectural movements of the twentieth century, influencing architects worldwide through his works and hundreds of apprentices in his Taliesin Fellowship.[1][2] Wright believed in designing in harmony with humanity and the environment, a philosophy he called organic architecture. This philosophy was exemplified in Fallingwater (1935), which has been called ""the best all-time work of American architecture"".[3]

Wright was the pioneer of what came to be called the Prairie School movement of architecture and also developed the concept of the Usonian home in Broadacre City, his vision for urban planning in the United States. He also designed original and innovative offices, churches, schools, skyscrapers, hotels, museums, and other commercial projects. Wright-designed interior elements (including leaded glass windows, floors, furniture and even tableware) were integrated into these structures. He wrote several books and numerous articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and in Europe. Wright was recognized in 1991 by the American Institute of Architects as ""the greatest American architect of all time"".[3] In 2019, a selection of his work became a listed World Heritage Site as The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright.

Raised in rural Wisconsin, Wright studied civil engineering at the University of Wisconsin and then apprenticed in Chicago, briefly with Joseph Lyman Silsbee, and then with Louis Sullivan at Adler & Sullivan. Wright opened his own successful Chicago practice in 1893 and established a studio in his Oak Park, Illinois home in 1898. His fame increased and his personal life sometimes made headlines: leaving his first wife Catherine Tobin for Mamah Cheney in 1909; the murder of Mamah and her children and others at his Taliesin estate by a staff member in 1914; his tempestuous marriage with second wife Miriam Noel (m. 1923–1927); and his courtship and marriage with Olgivanna Lazović (m. 1928–1959).

### Response:
",Frank Lloyd Wright continues to be an inspiration in architecture around the United States and many of his originally designed buildings and structures stand today.

Given a reference text about magnetism, tell me the definition of magnetism and how magnetic materials are classified.
Magnetism is the class of physical attributes that are mediated by a magnetic field, which refers to the capacity to induce attractive and repulsive phenomena in other entities. Electric currents and the magnetic moments of elementary particles giving rise to a magnetic field, which acts on other currents and magnetic moments. Magnetism is one aspect of the combined phenomena of electromagnetism. The most familiar effects occur in ferromagnetic materials, which are strongly attracted by magnetic fields and can be magnetized to become permanent magnets, producing magnetic fields themselves. Demagnetizing a magnet is also possible. Only a few substances are ferromagnetic; the most common ones are iron, cobalt, and nickel and their alloys. The rare-earth metals neodymium and samarium are less common examples. The prefix ferro- refers to iron because permanent magnetism was first observed in lodestone, a form of natural iron ore called magnetite, Fe3O4.

All substances exhibit some type of magnetism. Magnetic materials are classified according to their bulk susceptibility.[1] Ferromagnetism is responsible for most of the effects of magnetism encountered in everyday life, but there are actually several types of magnetism. Paramagnetic substances, such as aluminium and oxygen, are weakly attracted to an applied magnetic field; diamagnetic substances, such as copper and carbon, are weakly repelled; while antiferromagnetic materials, such as chromium and spin glasses, have a more complex relationship with a magnetic field. The force of a magnet on paramagnetic, diamagnetic, and antiferromagnetic materials is usually too weak to be felt and can be detected only by laboratory instruments, so in everyday life, these substances are often described as non-magnetic.

### Response:
","Magnetism is defined as the physical attributes that are mediated by a magnetic field, which is the capacity to induce attractive and repulsive forces. Magnetic materials are classified by their bulk susceptibility."

Sam takes the team to celebrate at his yet-to-open Nigerian restaurant, Ola's. Ted is disturbed to learn that his ex-wife Michelle is dating their former couple's therapist, Dr. Jacob; both Sharon and Sassy validate his concern that it is an ethical violation. Jamie feels overshadowed by Zava's stardom; Roy offers to train him. Rebecca visits her mother's psychic Tish, who tells her she will one day be a mother; Rebecca angrily rebuffs Tish as a fraud, but is later stunned when Sam hands her one of the green matchbooks he is giving out to the team, in line with one of Tish's premonitions. Colin introduces his boyfriend Michael to the team as just a friend, but Trent spots them kissing in private while leaving the restaurant.

What does moha mean
Moha (Chinese: 膜蛤; pinyin: Mó Há, pronounced [muǒ.xǎ]), literally ""admiring toad"" or ""toad worship"",[1] is an internet meme spoofing Jiang Zemin, former General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and paramount leader. It originated among the netizens in mainland China and has become a subculture on the Chinese internet. According to another explanation, it comes from China's social media Baidu Tieba. In the culture, Jiang is nicknamed há, or ""toad"", because of his supposed resemblance to a toad.[2] Netizens who móhá (worship the toad) call themselves ""toad fans"", ""toad lovers"" or ""toad worshippers"" (simplified Chinese: 蛤丝; traditional Chinese: 蛤絲), or ""mogicians"" (膜法师; 膜法師) which is a wordplay on mófǎshī (魔法师; 魔法師, magician) in Mandarin.[note 1]

Another nickname for Jiang is ""elder"" or ""senior"" (长者; 長者; Zhǎngzhě), because he once called himself an ""elder"" or ""senior"" when he was berating Hong Kong journalist Sharon Cheung who questioned him.[3][4][5] A video clip recording this event spread on the internet and led to the rise of the culture, which later greatly rose in popularity around 2014, when Hong Kong was experiencing a period of political instability. Initially, netizens extracted Jiang's quotes from the video and imitated his wording and tone, for parody and insult. However, as the culture developed, some imitations have taken to carrying affection toward him. The quotes for imitation have also evolved to include what he said during his leadership, and in his personal life.

Name some famous paintings by Van Gogh.
The time in Arles became one of Van Gogh's more prolific periods: he completed 200 paintings and more than 100 drawings and watercolours.[124] He was enchanted by the local countryside and light; his works from this period are rich in yellow, ultramarine and mauve. They include harvests, wheat fields and general rural landmarks from the area, including The Old Mill (1888), one of seven canvases sent to Pont-Aven on 4 October 1888 in an exchange of works with Paul Gauguin, Émile Bernard, Charles Laval and others.[125] The portrayals of Arles are informed by his Dutch upbringing; the patchworks of fields and avenues are flat and lacking perspective, but excel in their use of colour.[126]
In March 1888 he painted landscapes using a gridded ""perspective frame""; three of the works were shown at the annual exhibition of the Société des Artistes Indépendants. In April, he was visited by the American artist Dodge MacKnight, who was living nearby at Fontvieille.[127][128] On 1 May 1888, for 15 francs per month, he signed a lease for the eastern wing of the Yellow House at 2 place Lamartine. The rooms were unfurnished and had been uninhabited for months.[129]
On 7 May, Van Gogh moved from the Hôtel Carrel to the Café de la Gare,[130] having befriended the proprietors, Joseph and Marie Ginoux. The Yellow House had to be furnished before he could fully move in, but he was able to use it as a studio.[131] He wanted a gallery to display his work and started a series of paintings that eventually included Van Gogh's Chair (1888), Bedroom in Arles (1888), The Night Café (1888), Café Terrace at Night (September 1888), Starry Night Over the Rhone (1888), and Still Life: Vase with Twelve Sunflowers (1888), all intended for the decoration for the Yellow House.[132]
Van Gogh wrote that with The Night Café he tried ""to express the idea that the café is a place where one can ruin oneself, go mad, or commit a crime"".[133] When he visited Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer in June, he gave lessons to a Zouave second lieutenant – Paul-Eugène Milliet[134] – and painted boats on the sea and the village.[135] MacKnight introduced Van Gogh to Eugène Boch, a Belgian painter who sometimes stayed in Fontvieille, and the two exchanged visits in July.[134]

What is Chardonnay?
Chardonnay (UK: /ˈʃɑːrdəneɪ/, US: /ˌʃɑːrdənˈeɪ/,[1][2] French: [ʃaʁdɔnɛ] (listen)) is a green-skinned grape variety used in the production of white wine. The variety originated in the Burgundy wine region of eastern France, but is now grown wherever wine is produced, from England to New Zealand. For new and developing wine regions, growing Chardonnay is seen as a 'rite of passage' and an easy entry into the international wine market.

The Chardonnay grape itself is neutral, with many of the flavors commonly associated with the wine being derived from such influences as terroir and oak. It is vinified in many different styles, from the lean, crisply mineral wines of Chablis, France, to New World wines with oak and tropical fruit flavors. In cool climates (such as Chablis and the Carneros AVA of California), Chardonnay wine tends to be medium to light body with noticeable acidity and flavors of green plum, apple, and pear. In warmer locations (such as the Adelaide Hills and Mornington Peninsula in Australia and Gisborne and Marlborough region of New Zealand), the flavors become more citrus, peach, and melon, while in very warm locations (such as the Central Coast AVA of California), more fig and tropical fruit notes such as banana and mango come out. Wines that have gone through malolactic fermentation tend to have softer acidity and fruit flavors with buttery mouthfeel and hazelnut notes.

### Response:
","I had the most intriguing dream last night. I always remember my dreams starting in the middle of the story. It feels very natural and there is logical prelude to the event I am going through, but I don’t remember per say. In this dream I was taking part in my final university exams. This is a recurring dream I have. I was right before the beginning of the exam and could not remember any of my classes of the year. On the way to the exam room I was asking all my friends to share their knowledge with me to catch up. I was  trying to locate my class book in my backpack in an attempt to read through it one last time as the class doors were getting closer and closer. My anxiety was raising. When the doors opened, instead of entering a classroom. , I stepped onto a meadow on a sunny afternoon. Very naturally my exam became a scavenger hunt to find pages of my book hidden in trees or floating on the lake. I was not surprised and quickly went about looking for a boat to retrieve the pages floating on the lake.  As I was on the boat I discovered I could float and even fly, which made it much easier to go after all the pages. Dreams are always interesting to remember. They often revolve around common topics or events, like taking exams or flying and any many other events. I have read that dreams have meaning, I will need to research the meaning of this sequence of events."

What is a mortgage?

### Response:
","A mortgage loan or simply mortgage, in civil law jurisdicions known also as a hypothec loan, is a loan used either by purchasers of real property to raise funds to buy real estate, or by existing property owners to raise funds for any purpose while putting a lien on the property being mortgaged. The loan is ""secured"" on the borrower's property through a process known as mortgage origination. This means that a legal mechanism is put into place which allows the lender to take possession and sell the secured property (""foreclosure"" or ""repossession"") to pay off the loan in the event the borrower defaults on the loan or otherwise fails to abide by its terms. The word mortgage is derived from a Law French term used in Britain in the Middle Ages meaning ""death pledge"" and refers to the pledge ending (dying) when either the obligation is fulfilled or the property is taken through foreclosure. A mortgage can also be described as ""a borrower giving consideration in the form of a collateral for a benefit (loan)""."

What was the SS Robert Coryndon?
SS Robert Coryndon was a British twin-screw passenger and cargo ferry on Lake Albert in central Africa.

She was built in England in 1929 and reassembled in kit form at Lake Albert in 1930. She ran aground in 1962 and lay derelict until she was broken up for scrap between 2009 and 2012.

John I. Thornycroft & Company at Woolston, Hampshire built the ship for Kenya and Uganda Railways and Harbours in 1929–30. She was named after the South African Sir Robert Coryndon, who was Governor of Uganda 1918–22.

She was a ""knock-down"" ship. She was assembled in 1929 at Woolston. All her parts were marked with numbers, she was disassembled into many hundreds of parts, and transported in kit form to Africa, where she was reassembled on the shore of Lake Albert in 1930. Part of the overland journey to Lake Albert was by lorry, which severely limited the maximum size and weight of her parts.

Robert Coryndon was part of a plan for a network of railway, river steamer and lake steamer services linking British interests in Egypt, East Africa and southern Africa.[3] Sir Winston Churchill described her as ""the best library afloat"".

Fate
Robert Coryndon sank in 1962, around the time of Ugandan independence from Britain. She was not refloated.

In 1967 the East African Railways and Harbours Corporation (EAR&H) offered her wreck for sale, but she remained largely intact in 2009.

By the beginning of 2012 her wreck had been taken away ""in bits and pieces by cutting all the metal remains for scrap"" and only her aft king posts were still visible above the water.

Can you extract the different types of salts and sugars listed in the below text and show them as a bulleted list.
In consumer marketing, it is difficult to find examples of undifferentiated approaches. Even goods such as salt and sugar, which were once treated as commodities, are now highly differentiated. Consumers can purchase a variety of salt products; cooking salt, table salt, sea salt, rock salt, kosher salt, mineral salt, herbal or vegetable salts, iodized salt, salt substitutes, and many more. Sugar also comes in many different types - cane sugar, beet sugar, raw sugar, white refined sugar, brown sugar, caster sugar, sugar lumps, icing sugar (also known as milled sugar), sugar syrup, invert sugar, and a plethora of sugar substitutes including smart sugar which is essentially a blend of pure sugar and a sugar substitute. Each of these product types is designed to meet the needs of specific market segments. Invert sugar and sugar syrups, for example, are marketed to food manufacturers where they are used in the production of conserves, chocolate, and baked goods. Sugars marketed to consumers appeal to different usage segments – refined sugar is primarily for use on the table, while caster sugar and icing sugar are primarily designed for use in home-baked goods.

Is it faster to take the subway or drive a car?

### Response:
","Sometimes it is faster to take the subway and sometimes it is faster to drive a car. The answer for any particular trip primarily depends on the origin and destination of the trip. If the origin and destination are both near a subway station, then it is often faster to take the subway, especially if there is a lot of automobile traffic on the roads and you do not need to connect between subway lines. But if either the origin or destination, or both, are far from a subway station, then the total time for the trip may be dominated by the time it takes to get to and from the subway station on either or both ends of the journey; this may add enough time to the time spent on the subway so that the total trip end-to-end takes longer than driving the whole way."

### Response:
","My son and I, embarked on a biking trip from San Francisco to LA right before my son's college applications and essays were due. To start our journey, we rented a truck and transported our bikes from LA to San Francisco. We returned the truck in San Francisco and started our journet on our bikes. Our trip took eight days and was full of adventure and unexpected twists and turns. We had to stay in motels and camp sites along the way and endure biking many uphill miles. Our meals tasted the best after a lenghty daily travel, and the most enjoyable was the deep conversations we had without interruption of phone or social media. I shared my never spoken before youth experiences growing up in Iran. He seemed delighted to be hearing my experience and taking a mental note every step of the way.
Upon reflecting on our trip, we encountered numerous challenges. We lost our way for several miles, and to compound our predicament, our bikes broke down along the way. In addition, we were cited by the police for riding our bikes on the freeway and physically assaulted. Despite all these setbacks, we pushed ourselves to ride up to 80 miles each day.
Even to this day, my son frequently recalls our trip and how it brought us closer together. He also acknowledges the spiritual growth that we experienced as a result of the journey.
He was accpeted as the only two students to Berkely and many months later I asked him what set him apart from all A's students which he then responded my colledge essay and our SF biking trip."

When was the Goan civil code established?
The Goa Civil Code, also called the Goa Family Law, is the set of civil laws that governs the residents of the Indian state of Goa.[1][2] The Goan civil code was introduced after Portuguese Goa and Damaon were elevated from being mere Portuguese colonies to the status of a Província Ultramarina (Overseas possession) in 1869 AD.[3] The Goan civil code is a Indianised variant of Portuguese legal system that draws largely from Code Napoleon, a common legal system in a number of Continental European nations,[3] Indian law mostly derives from English common law that was formulated and applied in British India, and remains pegged to developments in the ""Charter of the British Commonwealth"". With a number of amendments, post the Partition of India, Indian laws as a whole, have religion-specific civil codes that separately govern adherents of different religions; (like the Muslim and Hindu personal laws,) and also has caste reservations. Goa and Damaon are an exception to that rule, in that a single code governs all the native Goans and the native Damanese of Damaon, Diu& Silvassa, irrespective of affiliation to religion, ethnicity& social strata.[4] The English translation of the civil code| is available on the Government of Goa's e-Gazette| dated 19/10/2018.[5]

What is the difference between Parthian and Arsacid Empire?
The Parthian Empire, also known as the Arsacid Empire was a major Iranian political and cultural power in ancient Iran from 247 BC to 224 AD. Its latter name comes from its founder, Arsaces I,[13] who led the Parni tribe in conquering the region of Parthia in Iran's northeast, then a satrapy (province) under Andragoras, who was rebelling against the Seleucid Empire. Mithridates I (r. c. 171–132 BC) greatly expanded the empire by seizing Media and Mesopotamia from the Seleucids. At its height, the Parthian Empire stretched from the northern reaches of the Euphrates, in what is now central-eastern Turkey, to present-day Afghanistan and western Pakistan. The empire, located on the Silk Road trade route between the Roman Empire in the Mediterranean Basin and the Han dynasty of China, became a center of trade and commerce.

### Response:
","Parthian and Arsacid are different names of the same ancient Iranian empire that ruled from 247 BC to 224 AD. The Parthian Kings, or Shahs, often used Arsaces as their crown names which is why some refer to this empire as the Arsacids. They are also called Parthian because they started by conquering the region of Partha in Iran's northeast and the adopted the language of that region, called Parthian Middle Persian."

What is blockchain technology?
A blockchain is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes.Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was created. Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.

### Response:
","A decentralized, distributed ledger that securely and openly records transactions is defined.

Blockchain technology was first introduced with the launch of Bitcoin in 2008 and has since grown to be used in a wide range of applications.

Technical details: Blockchain secures and verifies transactions using cryptography and hashing, and validates them using consensus techniques.

Applications: In addition to cryptocurrencies, blockchain has been utilized in supply chain management, voting systems, smart contracts, and other areas.

Limitations: Blockchain is criticized for using a lot of energy and for having problems scaling."

Given this paragraph about Charles Inglis, give answers to the following: his father's name, his colleague's name, and his grandfather's occupation.
Charles Inglis was the second son of Dr. Alexander Inglis (a general practitioner in Worcester) and his first wife, Florence, the daughter of newspaper proprietor John Frederick Feeney.[2] His elder brother was the historian John Alexander Inglis FRSE[3] Their father, Alexander Inglis was born in Scotland to a respectable family – his grandfather, John Inglis, was an Admiral in the Royal Navy and had captained HMS Belliqueux at the Battle of Camperdown in 1797.[4]

Charles Inglis was born on 31 July 1875. He was not expected to survive and was hurriedly baptised in his father's drawing room; his mother died from complications eleven days later.[4] His family moved to Cheltenham and Inglis was schooled at Cheltenham College from 1889 to 1894. In his final year, he was elected head boy and received a scholarship to study the Mathematics Tripos at King's College, Cambridge.[5][6] Inglis was 22nd wrangler[nb 1] when he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1897; he remained for a fourth year, achieving first class honours in Mechanical Sciences.[6][8] Inglis was a keen sportsman and enjoyed long-distance running, walking, mountaineering and sailing. At Cambridge, he nearly achieved a blue for long-distance running but was forced to withdraw from a significant race because of a pulled muscle.[5] He was also a follower of the Cambridge University Rugby Union team, watching their matches at Grange Road.[9]

After graduation, Inglis began work as an apprentice for the civil engineering firm of John Wolfe-Barry & Partners.[2][5] He worked as a draughtsman in the drawing office for several months before being placed with Alexander Gibb, who was acting as resident engineer on an extension to the Metropolitan District Railway between Whitechapel and Bow.[2][5] Inglis was responsible for the design and supervision of all thirteen bridges on the route.[2][8][10] It was during this time that he began his lifelong study of vibration and its effects on materials, particularly bridges.[2]

What are some of the highest quality, full flavored cigars I can buy in the united states?

### Response:
","Due to the US embargo banning importation of products from Cuba in the mid 20th century, the storied Cuban cigar has not been able to be legally purchased by US consumers.With that said, there are numerous highly regarded cigar makers in countries like Nicargua, the Dominican Republic, and Honduras whose cigars rival the best Cuban cigars, many of them full flavored. Here are a few options to consider:

Arturo Fuente Opus X - this is a highly complex, highly sought after, full-flavored cigar from the Dominican Republic that retails for ~$25 for a single, making it an expensive choice for a regular cigar smoker. With that said, it is near the top of the list of favorites for most cigar aficianados.

Padron Serie 1926 - this is a creamy, chocolatey cigar from Nicaragua that retails for around $17, making it a slightly more affordable option, though still a premium selection. These are produced in higher volume than the Opus, which makes them easier to fine.

Ashton VSG - this is a Dominican cigar, with VSG standing for ""Virgin Sun Grown."" The flavor profile is very unique due to the sun grown wrapper. These are about $13 for a single at retail depending on size.

There are dozens of reputable cigar makers making thousands of cigars, but those above are longstanding staples of many avid cigar smokers in the US."

Is Moore's law still viable?
Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years. Moore's law is an observation and projection of a historical trend. Rather than a law of physics, it is an empirical relationship linked to gains from experience in production. The observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel (and former CEO of the latter), who in 1965 posited a doubling every year in the number of components per integrated circuit,[a] and projected this rate of growth would continue for at least another decade. In 1975, looking forward to the next decade, he revised the forecast to doubling every two years, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 41%. While Moore did not use empirical evidence in forecasting that the historical trend would continue, his prediction held since 1975 and has since become known as a ""law"". Moore's prediction has been used in the semiconductor industry to guide long-term planning and to set targets for research and development, thus functioning to some extent as a self-fulfilling prophecy. Advancements in digital electronics, such as the reduction in quality-adjusted microprocessor prices, the increase in memory capacity (RAM and flash), the improvement of sensors, and even the number and size of pixels in digital cameras, are strongly linked to Moore's law. These ongoing changes in digital electronics have been a driving force of technological and social change, productivity, and economic growth. Industry experts have not reached a consensus on exactly when Moore's law will cease to apply. Microprocessor architects report that semiconductor advancement has slowed industry-wide since around 2010, slightly below the pace predicted by Moore's law. In September 2022 Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang considered Moore's law dead, while Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger was of the opposite view.

### Response:
","Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a circuit doubles about every two years. Through advancements in technology, Moore's law is still viable since 1975 with some experts believing the observation still holds and some seeing a slowing of Moore's observation."

A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, 1 × 5 or 5 × 1, involve 5 itself. However, 4 is composite because it is a product (2 × 2) in which both numbers are smaller than 4. Primes are central in number theory because of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic: every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime itself or can be factorized as a product of primes that is unique up to their order.

The property of being prime is called primality. A simple but slow method of checking the primality of a given number 
�
n, called trial division, tests whether 
�
n is a multiple of any integer between 2 and 
�
{\sqrt {n}}. Faster algorithms include the Miller–Rabin primality test, which is fast but has a small chance of error, and the AKS primality test, which always produces the correct answer in polynomial time but is too slow to be practical. Particularly fast methods are available for numbers of special forms, such as Mersenne numbers. As of December 2018 the largest known prime number is a Mersenne prime with 24,862,048 decimal digits.[1]

There are infinitely many primes, as demonstrated by Euclid around 300 BC. No known simple formula separates prime numbers from composite numbers. However, the distribution of primes within the natural numbers in the large can be statistically modelled. The first result in that direction is the prime number theorem, proven at the end of the 19th century, which says that the probability of a randomly chosen large number being prime is inversely proportional to its number of digits, that is, to its logarithm.

Several historical questions regarding prime numbers are still unsolved. These include Goldbach's conjecture, that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes, and the twin prime conjecture, that there are infinitely many pairs of primes having just one even number between them. Such questions spurred the development of various branches of number theory, focusing on analytic or algebraic aspects of numbers. Primes are used in several routines in information technology, such as public-key cryptography, which relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime factors. In abstract algebra, objects that behave in a generalized way like prime numbers include prime elements and prime ideals.

### Response:
","A prime number is a natural number great than one that is only divisible by itself and one. e.g. 5 is a prime number as it is only divisible by 5 and 1, but 4 is not as 4 is divisible by 4,2 and 1"

What are the main reasons Parisians want electric scooters to be banned according to the following article?
 
Parisians are voting on Sunday on whether to rid the streets of the French capital of electric scooters, although some say the city’s leaders ought to be focusing on more pressing issues.

Paris was a pioneer when it introduced e-scooters, or trottinettes, in 2018 as the city’s authorities sought to promote non-polluting forms of urban transport.

But as the two-wheeled vehicles grew in popularity, especially among young people, so did the number of accidents: in 2022, three people died and 459 were injured in e-scooter accidents in Paris.

In what is being billed as a “public consultation” voters are being asked: “For or against self-service scooters?”

Twenty-one polling stations have been set up across the city and will be open until 7pm local time, with the result expected at around 10pm.

Electric scooters available for rent on the Place du Trocadero, Paris.

Although 1.6 million people are eligible to vote, turnout is expected to be low.

Paris’s socialist mayor, Anne Hidalgo, has promoted cycling and bike-sharing but supports a ban on e-scooters.

In an interview with Agence France-Presses last week, Hidalgo said “self-service scooters are the source of tension and worry” for Parisians and that a ban would “reduce nuisance” in public spaces. However, she promised to respect the outcome of the vote even if it is not legally binding.

Paris has almost 15,000 e-scooters across its streets, operated by companies including Lime, Dott and Tier.

Detractors argue that e-scooter users disrespect the rules of the road and regularly flout a ban on riding on pavements. The vehicles are also often haphazardly parked or thrown into the River Seine.

In June 2021, a 31-year-old Italian woman was killed after being hit by an e-scooter with two passengers onboard while walking along the Seine.

“Scooters have become my biggest enemy. I’m scared of them,” Suzon Lambert, a 50-year-old teacher from Paris, told AFP. “Paris has become a sort of anarchy. There’s no space any more for pedestrians.”

Another Parisian told BFMTV: “It’s dangerous, and people use them badly. I’m fed up.”

Julian Sezgin, aged 15, said he often saw groups of two or three teenagers on e-scooters zooming past cars on busy roads. “I avoid going on e-scooters and prefer e-bikes as, in my opinion, they are safer and more efficient,” he told the Guardian.

### Response:

Given a reference text about the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, how many Super Bowls have they won.
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are a professional American football team based in Tampa, Florida. The Buccaneers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) South division. The club joined the NFL in 1976 as an expansion team, along with the Seattle Seahawks, and played its first season in the American Football Conference (AFC) West division. Prior to the 1977 season, Tampa Bay switched conferences and divisions with Seattle, becoming a member of the NFC Central division. As a result of the league's realignment prior to the 2002 season, the Buccaneers joined three former NFC West teams to form the NFC South. The club is owned by the Glazer family and plays its home games at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa.

The Buccaneers have won two Super Bowl championships and, along with the Baltimore Ravens, are the only two NFL franchises who are undefeated in multiple Super Bowl appearances. They were regarded as a perennial losing franchise for most of their first two decades due to suffering 26 consecutive losses in their first two seasons (including a winless inaugural season) and 14 consecutive losing seasons from 1983 to 1996. Despite these early struggles, Tampa Bay is the first post-merger expansion team to clinch a division title, win a playoff game, and host a conference championship; feats they accomplished by their fourth season in 1979. The team's image improved by the time of their first championship in 2002, also the first for a franchise built after the merger,[a] but they would not win another playoff game until their second Super Bowl championship season in 2020. Concurrent to the lack of success outside of their Super Bowl wins, the Buccaneers hold the NFL's lowest winning percentage at .404.

What does the distribution of isobars indicate?
An isobar is a line of equal or constant pressure on a graph, plot, or map; an isopleth or contour line of pressure. More accurately, isobars are lines drawn on a map joining places of equal average atmospheric pressure reduced to sea level for a specified period of time. In meteorology, the barometric pressures shown are reduced to sea level, not the surface pressures at the map locations. The distribution of isobars is closely related to the magnitude and direction of the wind field, and can be used to predict future weather patterns. Isobars are commonly used in television weather reporting.

Based on the provided paragraph give a bullet list of the names of the countries (regions) which took part in WWI and their reasons?
World War I or the First World War (28 July 1914 – 11 November 1918), often abbreviated as WWI, was one of the deadliest global conflicts in history. The first decade of the 20th century saw increasing diplomatic tension between the European great powers. This reached breaking point on 28 June 1914, when a Bosnian Serb named Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne. Austria-Hungary held Serbia responsible, and declared war on 28 July. Russia came to Serbia's defense, and by 4 August, defensive alliances had drawn in Germany, France, and Britain. German strategy in 1914 was to first defeat France, then attack Russia. However, this failed, and by the end of 1914, the Western Front consisted of a continuous line of trenches stretching from the English Channel to Switzerland. The Eastern Front was more fluid, but neither side could gain a decisive advantage, despite a series of costly offensives. Attempts by both sides to bypass the stalemate caused fighting to expand into the Middle East, the Alps, the Balkans, and overseas colonies, bringing Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, and others into the war.

### Response:
","The countries and regions that took part in World War I (WWI) and their reasons are as follows:

- Austria-Hungary: because their heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, was assassinated by a Bosnian Serb named Gavrilo Princip.
 
- Serbia: because Austria-Hungary declared war against them.

- Russia: because they wanted to defend Serbia.

- Germany, France, and Britain: because they were allies with the countries already engaging in the war.

- Middle East, the Alps, the Balkans, and overseas colonies, bringing Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, and others: because the Eastern Front of the war was more fluid, but neither side could gain a decisive advantage. Both sides had attempts to overcome the stalemate leading to the war expanding into these regions and countries."

How is digital switching possible?
Electronics deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes, sensors and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies. The nonlinear behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes digital switching possible, and electronics is widely used in information processing, telecommunications, and signal processing. Interconnection technologies such as circuit boards, electronics packaging technology, and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed components into a regular working system.
Today, most electronic devices use semiconductor components to perform electron control. The underlying principles that explain how semiconductors work are studied in solid state physics, whereas the design and construction of electronic circuits to solve practical problems are part of electronics engineering.

Extract the names of the teams that Michael Jordan has been a part of from the text below.
Michael Jeffrey Jordan (born February 17, 1963), also known by his initials MJ,[9] is an American former professional basketball player and businessman. His biography on the official National Basketball Association (NBA) website states: ""By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.""[10] He played fifteen seasons in the NBA, winning six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls. Jordan is the principal owner and chairman of the Charlotte Hornets of the NBA and of 23XI Racing in the NASCAR Cup Series. He was integral in popularizing the basketball sport and the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s,[11] becoming a global cultural icon.[12]

Jordan played college basketball for three seasons under coach Dean Smith with the North Carolina Tar Heels. As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982.[5] Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick,[5][13] and quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring while gaining a reputation as one of the game's best defensive players.[14] His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free-throw line in Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames ""Air Jordan"" and ""His Airness"".[5][13] Jordan won his first NBA title with the Bulls in 1991, and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a three-peat. Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the 1993–94 NBA season to play Minor League Baseball but returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three more championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular season wins in the 1995–96 NBA season.[5] He retired for the second time in January 1999 but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Washington Wizards.[5][13] During the course of his professional career he was also selected to play for the United States national team, winning four gold medals (at the 1983 Pan American Games, 1984 Summer Olympics, 1992 Tournament of the Americas and 1992 Summer Olympics), while also being undefeated.[15]

Given the paragraph, what is the term budgie smuggler colloquially use to describe?
A swim brief or racing brief is any briefs-style male swimsuit such as those worn in competitive swimming, diving and water polo. The popularity of the Australian Speedo brand racing brief has led to the use of its name in many countries around the world to refer to any racing brief, regardless of the maker.[1] Occasionally, the speedo genericized trademark is applied to square cut swimsuits,[citation needed] but in general the generic term is used in reference to swimming briefs. Swim briefs are also referred to as competition briefs, swimming trunks, bathers, togs, racer bathers, posing briefs, racing briefs, and colloquially in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom as ""budgie smugglers"".[2]

Like underwear briefs, swim briefs feature a triangular shaped front and a solid back providing form-fitting coverage. They typically are worn below the lower waist. They are generally secured by thin banding at the upper thighs, and a drawstring around the waist and/or an elastic waistband. Swim briefs are often made of a nylon and spandex (Lycra) composite, while some longer-lasting suits are made from polyester and still others from other materials. Most swim briefs have a beige or white front lining made of a similar fabric.

What is a Goldendoodle?
The Goldendoodle is a designer dog created by crossbreeding a Golden Retriever and a Poodle. First widely bred in the 1990s, they are bred in three different sizes—each corresponding to the size of Poodle used as a parent.

Goldendoodles often demonstrate Golden Retrievers' intuitive and human-oriented nature in addition to the intelligent personality and ""allergy-friendly"" coat of a Poodle.[1]

In the 1990s designer dog breeders in Australia and the United States (Ryan Harvey) started to widely cross Golden Retrievers and Poodles, adopting the term Goldendoodle to describe the cross.[2] The name Doodle is also used to describe this breed. The name Goldendoodle is derived from ""Golden"" (from Golden Retriever) and ""Labradoodle"" (itself a portmanteau of Labrador Retriever and a Poodle).[3][4] Deliberately breeding Poodles with Golden Retrievers actually preceded the 1990s. An example of this was done by Monica Dickens, the great-granddaughter of Charles Dickens, who crossed the two breeds in 1969.[5] The cross can result in a healthier animal than both parent breeds.[6][1][7]

The first litter of Mini Goldendoodles was created by Amy Lane of Fox Creek Farm in Berkeley Springs, WV. The litter arrived on 1/11/02 and consisted of 10 puppies.[citation needed] Two of these puppies were retained for future breeding and one of them produced the first litter of F1B Mini Goldendoodles. The term ""Goldendoodle"" was coined by Amy Lane.[citation needed] Amy Lane also created the first, and to this date, the only kennel club for Goldendoodles called the Goldendoodle Association of North America, Inc. This is a non-profit organization that guides the development of the Goldendoodle and also provides a registration service to document the lineage of Goldendoodles.[citation needed]

The original aim of the Goldendoodle's breeders was to produce an alternative to the popular Labradoodle.[3] Initially Goldendoodles were only bred from standard-sized Poodles, but designer breeders also started using small varieties of Poodles to create a smaller crossbreed.[2] As they are a hybrid cross, they are not recognized by the AKC or British Kennel Clubs. Goldendoodles have been developed beyond the F1 (Golden Retriever crossed with a Poodle) and are now available in deeper generations created by crossing two Goldendoodles. These are called multigenerational or multigen Goldendoodles.

### Response:
",A Goldendoodle is a crossbreed between a poodle and a golden retriever. Goldendoodles are so popular due to them being a hypoallergenic dog. Typically goldendooles have the personality of a Golden retriever and the hair and intelligent personality from a poodle.

Why should people drive cars with manual transmissions?

### Response:
","People should drive cars with manual transmissions because it forces drivers to be more engaged while driving and lowers the incidence of distracted driving, making it the safest choice overall.

Environmental concerns about fossil fuels aside, one of the biggest issues with driving today is distracted driving. With improvements in cruise control technology and other driver assistance functions like lane keep assist, cars are taking over more of the driving process than ever before. While the intent is to make it safer for drivers, it also has the unintended consequence of making easier for drivers to be distracted. 

Cars with manual transmissions not only force greater engagement and focus, but they are also either incompatible with, or only compatible with lesser versions of, certain driver assistance features like adaptive cruise control because lowering the speed while not being able to change the gear (which is manual) could cause the car to stall. 

Paradoxically, by increasing the required inputs and decreasing the number of driver assistance features, driving a manual transmission car is safest."

What is Hispania
Hispania (Latin: Hispānia [hɪsˈpaːnia], Spanish: [isˈpanja]; nearly identically pronounced in Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan, and Italian) was the Roman name for the Iberian Peninsula and its provinces. Under the Roman Republic, Hispania was divided into two provinces: Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior. During the Principate, Hispania Ulterior was divided into two new provinces, Baetica and Lusitania, while Hispania Citerior was renamed Hispania Tarraconensis. Subsequently, the western part of Tarraconensis was split off, first as Hispania Nova, later renamed ""Callaecia"" (or Gallaecia, whence modern Galicia). From Diocletian's Tetrarchy (AD 293) onwards, the south of the remainder of Tarraconensis was again split off as Carthaginensis, and all of the mainland Hispanic provinces, along with the Balearic Islands and the North African province of Mauretania Tingitana, were later grouped into a civil diocese headed by a vicarius. The name Hispania was also used in the period of Visigothic rule.

From Diocletian's Tetrarchy (AD 293) onwards, the south of the remainder of Tarraconensis was again split off as Carthaginensis, and all of the mainland Hispanic provinces, along with the Balearic Islands and the North African province of Mauretania Tingitana, were later grouped into a civil diocese headed by a vicarius. The name Hispania was also used in the period of Visigothic rule.

The modern place names Spain and Hispaniola are both derived from Hispania."

From the passage provided, extract the name of the last song recorded by Kishore Kumar
By September 1987, Kishore Kumar had decided to retire as he was unhappy with kind of songs and tunes being made by music directors and was planning to return to his birthplace Khandwa.[53]

On 13 October 1987, his brother Ashok Kumar's 76th birthday, he died of a heart attack in Bombay at 4:45 pm. His body was taken to Khandwa for cremation. Kishore had recorded his last song, ""Guru Guru"", a duet with Asha Bhosle for the film Waqt Ki Awaz (1988) composed by Bappi Lahiri for Mithun Chakraborty and Sridevi, the day before he died.[85][86]

Recalling the day of Kishore Kumar's death and his last lines before he took his last breath, his wife Leena Chandavarkar was quoted as saying: ""On the morning of October 13 (the day Kishore Kumar passed away in 1987), he looked pale and as though in deep sleep. As I went near him, he woke up and asked, ‘Did you get scared? Today is my holiday’.” That day he had several meetings at home. During lunch he told me that we’d watch the film River of No Return in the evening. A little later, I heard him move furniture in the next room. When I went to see what was happening, I saw him lying on the bed. Nervously he said, ‘I’m feeling weak’. I ran to call the doctor. He got angry and said, ‘If you call the doctor, I’ll get a heart-attack’. Those were his last lines. His eyes were wide open and he was breathing out. I thought he was fooling as usual but that was the end.""[70]

When did the global population reach 8 billion people?
The UN estimated that the world population reached one billion for the first time in 1804. It was another 123 years before it reached two billion in 1927, but it took only 33 years to reach three billion in 1960.[62] Thereafter, it took 14 years for the global population to reach four billion in 1974, 13 years to reach five billion in 1987, 12 years to reach six billion in 1999 and, according to the United States Census Bureau, 13 years to reach seven billion in March 2012.[63] The United Nations, however, estimated that the world population reached seven billion in October 2011.[64][65][66]

According to the UN, the global population reached eight billion in November 2022,[67] but because the growth rate is slowing, it will take another 15 years to reach around 9 billion by 2037 and 20 years to reach 10 billion by 2057.[68] Alternative scenarios for 2050 range from a low of 7.4 billion to a high of more than 10.6 billion.[69] Projected figures vary depending on underlying statistical assumptions and the variables used in projection calculations, especially the fertility and mortality variables. Long-range predictions to 2150 range from a population decline to 3.2 billion in the ""low scenario"", to ""high scenarios"" of 24.8 billion.[69] One extreme scenario predicted a massive increase to 256 billion by 2150, assuming the global fertility rate remained at its 1995 level of 3.04 children per woman; however, by 2010 the global fertility rate had declined to 2.52.[70][71]

There is no estimation for the exact day or month the world's population surpassed one or two billion. The points at which it reached three and four billion were not officially noted, but the International Database of the United States Census Bureau placed them in July 1959 and April 1974 respectively. The United Nations did determine, and commemorate, the ""Day of 5 Billion"" on 11 July 1987, and the ""Day of 6 Billion"" on 12 October 1999. The Population Division of the United Nations declared the ""Day of Seven Billion"" to be 31 October 2011.[72] The United Nations marked the birth of the eight billionth person on 15 November 2022.[73][67]

Why should I use toothpaste
Toothpaste is a paste or gel dentifrice used with a toothbrush to clean and maintain the aesthetics and health of teeth. Toothpaste is used to promote oral hygiene: it is an abrasive that aids in removing dental plaque and food from the teeth, assists in suppressing halitosis, and delivers active ingredients (most commonly fluoride) to help prevent tooth decay (dental caries) and gum disease (gingivitis).[1] Owing to differences in composition and fluoride content, not all toothpastes are equally effective in maintaining oral health. The decline of tooth decay during the 20th century has been attributed to the introduction and regular use of fluoride-containing toothpastes worldwide.[2][3] Large amounts of swallowed toothpaste can be toxic.[4] Common colors for toothpaste include white (sometimes with colored stripes or green tint) and blue.

Usefulness
Toothpastes are generally useful to maintain dental health. Toothpastes containing fluoride are effective at preventing tooth decay.[2][5][6] Toothpastes may also help to control and remove plaque build-up, promoting healthy gums. A 2016 systematic review indicated that using toothpaste when brushing the teeth does not necessarily impact the level of plaque removal.[7] However, the active ingredients in toothpastes are able to prevent dental diseases with regular use.[8]

Ingredients
Toothpastes are derived from a variety of components, the three main ones being abrasives, fluoride, and detergent.

What was the Great Depression?

### Response:
","The Great Depression (1929–1939) was an economic shock that impacted most countries across the world. It was a period of economic depression that became evident after a major fall in stock prices in the United States. The economic contagion began around September and led to the Wall Street stock market crash of October 24 (Black Thursday). It was the longest, deepest, and most widespread depression of the 20th century.

Between 1929 and 1932, worldwide gross domestic product (GDP) fell by an estimated 15%. By comparison, worldwide GDP fell by less than 1% from 2008 to 2009 during the Great Recession. Some economies started to recover by the mid-1930s. However, in many countries, the negative effects of the Great Depression lasted until the beginning of World War II. Devastating effects were seen in both rich and poor countries with falling personal income, prices, tax revenues, and profits. International trade fell by more than 50%, unemployment in the U.S. rose to 23% and in some countries rose as high as 33%."

From the passage list down the religious aspects of a funeral. List the results in comma separated format.
A funeral is a ceremony connected with the final disposition of a corpse, such as a burial or cremation, with the attendant observances.[1] Funerary customs comprise the complex of beliefs and practices used by a culture to remember and respect the dead, from interment, to various monuments, prayers, and rituals undertaken in their honor. Customs vary between cultures and religious groups. Funerals have both normative and legal components. Common secular motivations for funerals include mourning the deceased, celebrating their life, and offering support and sympathy to the bereaved; additionally, funerals may have religious aspects that are intended to help the soul of the deceased reach the afterlife, resurrection or reincarnation.

The funeral usually includes a ritual through which the corpse receives a final disposition.[2] Depending on culture and religion, these can involve either the destruction of the body (for example, by cremation or sky burial) or its preservation (for example, by mummification or interment). Differing beliefs about cleanliness and the relationship between body and soul are reflected in funerary practices. A memorial service (or celebration of life) is a funerary ceremony that is performed without the remains of the deceased person.[3]

The word funeral comes from the Latin funus, which had a variety of meanings, including the corpse and the funerary rites themselves. Funerary art is art produced in connection with burials, including many kinds of tombs, and objects specially made for burial like flowers with a corpse.

Why is the Cave of the Crystals or Giant Crystal Cave closed to the public?
Cave of the Crystals or Giant Crystal Cave (Spanish: Cueva de los cristales) is a cave connected to the Naica Mine at a depth of 300 metres (980 ft), in Naica, Chihuahua, Mexico. It takes the form of a chamber within the limestone host rock of the mine, and is about 109-metre (358 ft) long with a volume of 5,000 to 6,000 cubic metres (180,000 to 210,000 cu ft).

The chamber contains giant selenite crystals (gypsum, CaSO4 · 2 H2O), some of the largest natural crystals ever found. The largest is 11.40 metres (37.4 ft), with a volume of about 5 cubic metres (180 cu ft), and an estimated mass of 12 tonnes. When not flooded, the cave is extremely hot, with air temperatures reaching up to 58 °C (136 °F)[3] with 90 to 99 percent humidity. This is comparable to temperature records in Death Valley, but with much wetter air. The cave is relatively unexplored because of these factors. Without proper protection, people can only endure approximately ten minutes of exposure at a time.

The cave was discovered in April 2000 by brothers Juan and Pedro Sánchez while drilling in the mine. As of October 2015, the mine had reflooded and the cavern filled once more with the water rich in minerals required for the crystals to grow.

A group of scientists in the Naica Project have been studying these caverns.

The Salvation Army (TSA) is a Protestant Christian church and an international charitable organization headquartered in London, England that is aligned with the Wesleyan-Holiness movement. The organisation reports a worldwide membership of over 1.7 million,[3] comprising soldiers, officers and adherents collectively known as Salvationists. Its founders sought to bring salvation to the poor, destitute, and hungry by meeting both their ""physical and spiritual needs"". It is present in 133 countries,[4] running charity shops, operating shelters for the homeless and disaster relief, and humanitarian aid to developing countries.

The theology of the Salvation Army is derived from Methodism, although it is distinctive in institution and practice. A distinctive characteristic of the Salvation Army is its use of titles derived from military ranks, such as ""lieutenant"" or ""major"". It does not celebrate the rites of Baptism and Holy Communion. However, the Army's doctrine is aligned with the Wesleyan–Arminian tradition, particularly the holiness movement. The Army's purposes are ""the advancement of the Christian religion... of education, the relief of poverty, and other charitable objects beneficial to society or the community of mankind as a whole"".[5]

The Army was founded in 1865 in London by one-time Methodist preacher William Booth and his wife Catherine as the East London Christian Mission, and can trace its origins to the Blind Beggar tavern. In 1878, Booth reorganised the mission, becoming its first General and introducing the military structure which has been retained as a matter of tradition.[6] Its highest priority is its Christian principles. The current international leader of The Salvation Army and chief executive officer (CEO) is General Brian Peddle, who was elected by the High Council of The Salvation Army on 3 August 2018.[7]

In 2011, Charity Watch rated the Salvation Army an ""A−"" to an ""A"",[8] indicating a high level of financial efficiency and organisational transparency. The Salvation Army has received an A-rating from the American Institute of Philanthropy.

The Salvation Army is one of the world's largest providers of social aid,[citation needed] with expenditures including operating costs of $2.6 billion in 2004, helping more than 32 million people in the U.S. alone. In addition to community centres and disaster relief, the organisation does work in refugee camps, especially among displaced people in Africa. In the United Kingdom, the Salvation Army is no longer the largest nongovernmental provider of social services; however, it still provides a significant service to people in need. The Salvation Army is the fourth largest charity in the United States, with private donations in excess of $2 billion in 2022,[9] and is a member of the American organisation Christian Churches Together.[10

How long does it typically take a battery storage power station to transition to full power from standby?
A battery storage power station is a type of energy storage power station that uses a group of batteries to store electrical energy. Battery storage is the fastest responding dispatchable source of power on electric grids, and it is used to stabilise those grids, as battery storage can transition from standby to full power in under a second to deal with grid contingencies.

At full rated power, battery storage power stations are generally designed to output for up to a few hours. Battery storage can be used for short-term peak power and ancillary services, such as providing operating reserve and frequency control to minimize the chance of power outages. They are often installed at, or close to, other active or disused power stations and may share the same grid connection to reduce costs. Since battery storage plants require no deliveries of fuel, are compact compared to generating stations and have no chimneys or large cooling systems, they can be rapidly installed and placed if necessary within urban areas, close to customer load.

What is a personality test?
The origins of personality assessment date back to the 18th and 19th centuries, when personality was assessed through phrenology, the measurement of bumps on the human skull, and physiognomy, which assessed personality based on a person's outer appearances.[18] Sir Francis Galton took another approach to assessing personality late in the 19th century. Based on the lexical hypothesis, Galton estimated the number of adjectives that described personality in the English dictionary.[19] Galton's list was eventually refined by Louis Leon Thurstone to 60 words that were commonly used for describing personality at the time.[19] Through factor analyzing responses from 1300 participants, Thurstone was able to reduce this severely restricted pool of 60 adjectives into seven common factors.[20][19] This procedure of factor analyzing common adjectives was later utilized by Raymond Cattell (7th most highly cited psychologist of the 20th Century—based on the peer-reviewed journal literature),[21] who subsequently utilized a data set of over 4000 affect terms from the English dictionary that eventually resulted in construction of the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (16PF) which also measured up to eight second-stratum personality factors.[22] Of the many introspective (i.e., subjective) self-report instruments constructed to measure the putative Big Five personality dimensions, perhaps the most popular has been the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R)[19] However, the psychometric properties of the NEO-PI-R (including its factor analytic/construct validity) has been severely criticized.

Given a reference text about Stanley Franklin Browne, how many aerial victories during World War II did he have and what did he do when he returned from the war.
Stanley Franklin Browne, DFC & Bar (29 October 1919 – 13 January 2011) was a New Zealand flying ace of the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) during the Second World War. He was officially credited with at least five aerial victories.

Born in Wellington, Browne was a university student when he joined the RNZAF in March 1941. Once his flight training in New Zealand was completed, he proceeded to the United Kingdom to serve with the Royal Air Force. He was posted to No. 485 Squadron in early 1942 but was shot down later in the year over Germany-occupied France. With the help of the French Resistance he avoided the Germans and made his way to the south of France. He was caught when crossing the border into Vichy France and was interned for several weeks. He escaped captivity and eventually back to the United Kingdom. He was transferred to the Middle East where he ferried aircraft before being posted to No. 93 Squadron. He flew Supermarine Spitfires in the Tunisian campaign and in the Allied invasion of Sicily, shooting down a number of German aircraft before being rested in December 1943. After a spell on instructing duties he returned to operational flying with No. 485 Squadron during the final stages of the war in Europe. He briefly commanded the squadron before it was disbanded in August 1945.

Returning to civilian life after the war, he returned to his university studies, becoming a chemist. He briefly served in the New Zealand Territorial Air Force and later became a farmer and then a teacher. He died in 2011, aged 91, at Tauranga.

Bono's lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal and sociopolitical themes. Popular for their live performances, the group have staged several ambitious and elaborate tours over their career.

### Response:

### Instruction:
Please give me an example of this phenomenon that I can understand as a layman.
In signal processing and related disciplines, aliasing is an effect that causes different signals to become indistinguishable (or aliases of one another) when sampled. It also often refers to the distortion or artifact that results when a signal reconstructed from samples is different from the original continuous signal.

### Response:
","An example of aliasing that easy to understand as a layman is the 'wagon wheel effect'. You've probably seen the wagon wheel effect when watching a movie or tv show and the wheels of a car appear to be spinning backwards even as the car moves forwards. This is an effect of aliasing. This occurs because the sampling rate of the film is not adequate to capture the frequency of the signal (the frequency that the tires are spinning forwards) and the signal becomes indistinguishable from another signal (a frequency of the tires spinning backwards). As an example of how this happens imagine that the camera's sampling rate allows it to record an image frame at about 90% of the frequency that the tires are spinning. That is, the tire is spinning fast enough that it rotates 90% around in between each picture the camera can take. In this case, the wheel will look like its rotated backwards by 10% of a rotation on each image. When you put these images together in a film, the tires will appear to be rotating backwards."

What do you think about the existence of alien lifeform?

### Response:
","Despite there is no direct evidence to support the existence of aliens, we human beings still put effort into finding them. Given the human nature I can see 3 outcomes. One is we eventually find one. Another is we continue searching until the end of humanity.Last one is we somehow prove we are the only life form in the universe. Yet either result is the final step. What would we do if we did find aliens? What would we do if we exhausted all methods yet still no results? What if there are things just not perceivable to human beings? I guess what matters is not the final result, but the progress and efforts we put into it. Given the universe is so huge, what else would you wanna search for?"

What are major rivers in Serbia
All rivers in Serbia belong to the drainage basins of three seas: Black Sea, Adriatic Sea or Aegean Sea.

The largest in area, Black Sea drainage basin, covers an area of 81,261 km2 or 92% of the territory of Serbia. The entire basin is drained by only one river, the Danube, which flows into the Black Sea. All major rivers in Serbia, like Tisa, Sava, Velika Morava and Drina belong to it.

The Adriatic Sea drainage basin covers an area of 4,500 km2 or 5% of territory of Serbia. It comprises the western half of the Kosovo and Metohija and it is mostly drained by one river, the White Drin, which in Albania meets the Black Drin to create the Drin river, which flows into the Adriatic Sea. Smaller portion of it is drained by Crni Kamen-Radika river in the extreme southern region of Gora, which also drains into Black Drin in North Macedonia.

The Aegean Sea basin is the smallest in area, 2,650 km2 or 3% of the territory of Serbia, and covers the southern parts of Serbia, to the Macedonian and Bulgarian borders. It is drained by three rivers: Lepenac, Pčinja and Dragovištica. The first two flow into the Vardar river in North Macedonia, and the third flows into the Struma river in Bulgaria, and both of those rivers flow into the Aegean Sea.

All three basins meet at the Drmanska glava peak on the Crnoljeva mountain in central Kosovo, which represents the water divide of Serbia and the major one in the Balkans, as it divides three out of the Balkan's four drainage basins (the fourth being the Ionian Sea).

List down the key takeaways from the below paragraph on how Singapore growth is derived from its monetary policy
Unlike many other central banks such as Federal Reserve System, European Central Bank or Bank of England, MAS does not regulate the monetary system via interest rates to influence the liquidity in the system. Instead, it chooses to do it via the foreign exchange mechanism, which it has been doing since 1981. In doing so it manages the Singapore dollar versus a number of currencies that they do not reveal publicly – a Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$ NEER). It carries this out by intervening in the SGD market as well as other operations in the money market.[146][147] The MAS reviews its policy stance less frequently than most central banks, in a cycle that is around every 6 months.[148] In some circumstances, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic MAS can change the date of its twice yearly meeting.[149]

### Response:
","Policy to adopt foreign exchange mechanism instead of interest rates to regulate monetary system
It manages Singapore dollar against multiple currency.

Why are cats so picky about what they eat?
Cats have relatively few taste buds compared to humans (470 or so versus more than 9,000 on the human tongue). Domestic and wild cats share a taste receptor gene mutation that keeps their sweet taste buds from binding to sugary molecules, leaving them with no ability to taste sweetness. Their taste buds instead respond to acids, amino acids like protein, and bitter tastes. Cats also have a distinct temperature preference for their food, preferring food with a temperature around 38 °C (100 °F) which is similar to that of a fresh kill and routinely rejecting food presented cold or refrigerated (which would signal to the cat that the ""prey"" item is long dead and therefore possibly toxic or decomposing).

### Response:
","Cats' taste buds respond to acids, protein, and bitter tastes. The taste buds do not respond to sweetness. Additionally, cats prefer food with a temperature near 100 °F (38 °C). For wild cats, this temperature is associated with fresh food as opposed to food that may be decomposing."

How is electricity generated?
Electricity generation is the process of generating electric power from sources of primary energy. For utilities in the electric power industry, it is the stage prior to its delivery (transmission, distribution, etc.) to end users or its storage (using, for example, the pumped-storage method).

The first power plants used water power or coal. Today, various energy sources are used, such as coal, nuclear, natural gas, hydroelectric, wind, and oil, as well as solar energy, tidal power, and geothermal sources.

### Response:
","Electricity generation is the process of generating electric power from sources of primary energy. For utilities in the electric power industry, it is the stage prior to its delivery (transmission, distribution, etc.) to end users or its storage (using, for example, the pumped-storage method).

Electricity is not freely available in nature, so it must be ""produced"" (transforming other forms of energy into electricity). Production is carried out in power stations (also called ""power plants""). Electricity is most often generated at a power plant by electromechanical generators, primarily driven by heat engines fueled by combustion or nuclear fission but also by other means such as the kinetic energy of flowing water and wind. Other energy sources include solar photovoltaics and geothermal power. There are also exotic and speculative methods to recover energy, such as proposed fusion reactor designs which aim to directly extract energy from intense magnetic fields generated by fast-moving charged particles generated by the fusion reaction."

Given the following paragraph about the Sanford Stadium of the University of Georgia, where does the name of the stadium originate from?
Built for $360,000 to replace the former Sanford Field in nearby Central Campus, Sanford Stadium was inaugurated on October 12, 1929, with a 15–0 victory over the Yale Bulldogs football team. Originally constructed to accommodate 30,000 fans, a double deck addition in 1967 added 19,000 more seats, and a 1981 addition to encircle the field added another 19,000 seats. After several more renovations, the stadium now holds more than 93,000 spectators, making it one of the largest collegiate stadiums in the country and the thirteenth largest stadium in the world. The stadium is named for Steadman Sanford, a former president of the university and chancellor of the University System of Georgia.[143] Besides being the home of the Georgia Bulldogs football team, the stadium also serves as an event venue, the location of undergraduate graduation ceremonies, and was used for the medal competition of men's and women's Olympic football (soccer) at the 1996 Summer Olympics.

### Response:
",The Sanford Stadium of the University of Georgia is named after Steadman Sanford who was both a former president and chancellor of the University of Georgia.

### Instruction:
What are the 5 most effective ways to convert a prospect to a customer?

### Response:
","The journey from cold prospect to loyal customer is as tricky as the alchemy that transforms a stranger into a close personal friend. While there are a thousand possible paths, a handful of methods have proven consistently effective as triggers for moving prospects down the funnel toward purchase.

The first is personal referral. A personal referral or endorsement is worth more than 10,000 words of marketing material. Knowing that someone we know and trust can vouch for a product or service counts for so much that we will instinctually lower our guard and open our ears to a sales pitch.

Second is the testimonial. Like a referral, knowing that someone else -- generally a brand we know or at least can recognize -- uses a product or service predisposes us to try it ourselves. This is especially true of unknown brands or products. Think of when you pass a new restaurant. You may not know the name, the menu or the quality but if there's a crowd inside we naturally assume it must be good. The same goes for a new brand -- when you see others are endorsing it, we relax our natural suspicion and are more willing to give it a try.

Third is the offer. It's not enough to build a great product. You have to overcome people's natural reluctance to open their wallets when you're asking them to pay full price. The offer can take many forms -- from a discount to a free trial to a bonus offer. Adding urgency -- such as a limited quantity or expiration on the offer can also help.

Fourth is the three-step. This works especially well for big-ticket items or purchases that involve a large number of people or disruption to an organization. The 3-step acknowledges that nobody buys a $2,000,000 solution without giving it a lot of thought. So first we simply get them to raise their hand and express interest. This can be done through a top-of-funnel asset like an eBook or webinar. The second step is an offer that gets them more involved with the product, such as a demo. And the third step is a face-to-face meeting with the sales team.

Fifth is third-party validation. Many prospects have an allergic reaction to anything that smells like marketing. But what if they are reading a glowing piece about your. in the Wall Street Journal? Or Gartner places you at the top of one of its magic quadrants? This kind of validation from what is perceived as an objective source carries a lot more weight than marketing content. 

In practice, most businesses use a combination of the five techniques described above. Each will resonate in different ways with prospects; and in combination they can be extremely effective at creating that aura around your company and products that cause the prospect to push the ""Buy now"" button."

What were the key points of the Treaty of Versailles?
The most critical and controversial provision in the treaty was: ""The Allied and Associated Governments affirm and Germany accepts the responsibility of Germany and her allies for causing all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany and her allies."" The other members of the Central Powers signed treaties containing similar articles. This article, Article 231, became known as the War Guilt clause. The treaty required Germany to disarm, make ample territorial concessions, and pay reparations to certain countries that had formed the Entente powers. In 1921 the total cost of these reparations was assessed at 132 billion gold marks (then $31.4 billion or £6.6 billion, roughly equivalent to US$442 billion or UK£284 billion in 2023). Because of the way the deal was structured, the Allied Powers intended Germany would only ever pay a value of 50 billion marks.

### Response:
",The Treaty of Versailles was a peace treaty to end World War I. The critical point in the treaty between the Germans and the Allied powers was that Germany accepted full responsibility for the loss and damage incurred to the Allies. Germany was required to disarm and pay reparations estimated at $31.4 billion in 1921.

What is the best way to prep concrete before applying epoxy?

### Response:
","There are several ways to prepare concrete before applying an epoxy coating. Preparation ensures that the appropriate texture has been introduced to the top layer of the concrete and helps the epoxy to bond with the concrete better. This ensures long-lasting results. All of these different methods of preparing concrete vary in terms of the level of difficulty as well as the efficacy produced. Following are the most popular techniques:

1. Acid Etching: This is the most DIY friendly option & involves the use of an acid that is allowed to rest for some time over the concrete surface and then cleaned after a few minutes. This is also the quickest among all the techniques. The downside however is that the etching process may not produce the best concrete texture that ensures a long-lasting bond. 
2. Walk-behind Concrete Diamond grinder: This produces one of the best results when compared to the other techniques. It involves the use of a walk behind concrete grinder which has been fitted with a diamond grinding attachment. The disadvantage of this method is that it requires specialized equipment which may not be readily available & is a lot more time consuming compared to Acid etching.
3. Hand Grinder with Diamond Cup Wheel: This is the most accessible option that yields results that are equivalent to using a walk-behind concrete grinder. The only drawback of this approach is that this is the most time consuming compared to other methods and is only practical for covering small areas."

From the passage list down the location of Visa data centers. List the results in semi colon separated format.
Visa Inc. (/ˈviːzə, ˈviːsə/; stylized as VISA) is an American multinational financial services corporation headquartered in San Francisco, California.[1][4] It facilitates electronic funds transfers throughout the world, most commonly through Visa-branded credit cards, debit cards and prepaid cards.[5] Visa is one of the world's most valuable companies.

Visa does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for consumers; rather, Visa provides financial institutions with Visa-branded payment products that they then use to offer credit, debit, prepaid and cash access programs to their customers. In 2015, the Nilson Report, a publication that tracks the credit card industry, found that Visa's global network (known as VisaNet) processed 100 billion transactions during 2014 with a total volume of US$6.8 trillion.[6]

Visa was founded in 1958 by Bank of America (BofA) as the BankAmericard credit card program.[7] In response to competitor Master Charge (now Mastercard), BofA began to license the BankAmericard program to other financial institutions in 1966.[8] By 1970, BofA gave up direct control of the BankAmericard program, forming a cooperative with the other various BankAmericard issuer banks to take over its management. It was then renamed Visa in 1976.[9]

Nearly all Visa transactions worldwide are processed through the company's directly operated VisaNet at one of four secure data centers, located in Ashburn, Virginia; Highlands Ranch, Colorado; London, England; and Singapore.[10] These facilities are heavily secured against natural disasters, crime, and terrorism; can operate independently of each other and from external utilities if necessary; and can handle up to 30,000 simultaneous transactions and up to 100 billion computations every second.[6][11][12]

Visa is the world's second-largest card payment organization (debit and credit cards combined), after being surpassed by China UnionPay in 2015, based on annual value of card payments transacted and number of issued cards.[13] However, because UnionPay's size is based primarily on the size of its domestic market in China, Visa is still considered the dominant bankcard company in the rest of the world, where it commands a 50% market share of total card payments.

Name the Pandavas.
The Pandavas (Sanskrit: पाण्डव, IAST: Pāṇḍava) refers to the five legendary brothers— Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva—who are the central characters of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. They are acknowledged as the sons of Pandu, the King of Kuru, but were fathered by different Devas (gods) due to Pandu's inability to naturally conceive children. In the epic, the Pandavas married Draupadi, the princess of Panchala, and founded the city of Indraprastha after the Kuru Kingdom was split to avoid succession disputes. After their paternal cousins the Kauravas—led by Duryodhana—tricked them into surrendering their kingdom and refused to return it, the Pandavas waged a civil war against their extended family, and this conflict was known as the Kurukshetra War. With the help of the god Krishna, the Pandavas eventually won the war with the death of the Kauravas, albeit at great cost.[1]

How the interpretation of the word nature evolved over time?
Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. ""Nature"" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.[1]

The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or ""essential qualities, innate disposition"", and in ancient times, literally meant ""birth"".[2] In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics of plants, animals, and other features of the world to develop of their own accord.[3][4] The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the original notion;[1] it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency ever since.

During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws.[5][6] With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention: it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history (Hegel, Marx). However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the pre-Socratic one, got reborn at the same time, especially after Charles Darwin.[1]

Within the various uses of the word today, ""nature"" often refers to geology and wildlife. Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth. It is often taken to mean the ""natural environment"" or wilderness—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, ""human nature"" or ""the whole of nature"". This more traditional concept of natural things that can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind. Depending on the particular context, the term ""natural"" might also be distinguished from the unnatural or the supernatural.[1]

### Response:
","In ancient times nature was derived from the Greek word physis (translated into Latin as natura), that is related to the intrinsic characteristics of plants, animals.

How should I maintain my bicycle?

### Response:
","Keep your bicycle clean. Most important of all, keep your bicycle’s drivetrain clean. A bicycle’s drivetrain is the chain, chainrings and pulleys which make the rear wheel turn. If you can, wipe down the drivetrain with a cleaning lubricant made for bicycle drivetrains after each long ride, or every other short ride. Doing so will ensure that your ride is noticeably more enjoyable. Shifting will remain smooth and reliable, and pedaling will be easier. Dirty drivetrains are squeaky and loud. Your clean drivetrain will be nice and quiet. Your clean drivetrain will also last much longer since you are regularly cleaning away the dirt and other road grit and sweat which collects in the chain and grinds away everything it touches. If you are unable to maintain your bicycle, take it to the local bike shop at least once a year for maintenance and tune up. You won’t regret it."

From the given passage, find out why companies would announce their future products much in advance.
The Osborne effect is a social phenomenon of customers canceling or deferring orders for the current, soon-to-be-obsolete product as an unexpected drawback of a company's announcing a future product prematurely. It is an example of cannibalization.
The term alludes to the Osborne Computer Corporation, whose second product did not become available until more than a year after it was announced. The company's subsequent bankruptcy was widely blamed on reduced sales after the announcement.
The Osborne Effect states that prematurely discussing future, unavailable products damages sales of existing products. The name comes from the planned replacement of the Osborne 1, an early personal computer first sold by the Osborne Computer Corporation in 1981. In 1983, founder Adam Osborne pre-announced several next-generation computer models (the Osborne Executive and Osborne Vixen), which were only prototypes, highlighting the fact that they would outperform the existing model as the prototypes dramatically cut down assembly time. A widely held belief was that sales of the Osborne 1 fell sharply as customers anticipated those more advanced systems, leading to a sales decline from which Osborne Computer was unable to recover. This belief appeared in the media almost immediately after the company's September 1983 bankruptcy:

To give the jazzy $2,495 Osborne Executive a running start, Adam began orchestrating publicity early in 1983. We, along with many other magazines, were shown the machine in locked hotel rooms. We were required not to have anything in print about it until the planned release date in mid-April. As far as we know, nothing did appear in print, but dealers heard about the plans and cancelled orders for the Osborne 1 in droves. In early April, Osborne told dealers he would be showing them the machine on a one-week tour the week of 17 April, and emphasized that the new machine was not a competitor for the Osborne 1. But dealers didn't react the way Osborne expected; said Osborne, ""All of them just cancelled their orders for the Osborne 1.""

Osborne reacted by drastically cutting prices on the Osborne 1 in an effort to stimulate cash flow. But nothing seemed to work, and for several months sales were practically non-existent.

Pre-announcement is done for several reasons: to reassure current customers that there is improvement or lower cost coming, to increase the interest of the media and investors in the company's future prospects, and to intimidate or confuse competitors. When done correctly, the sales or cash flow impact to the company is minimal, with the revenue drop for the current product being offset by orders or completed sales of the new product as it becomes available. However, when the Osborne effect occurs, the quantity of unsold goods increases and the company must react by discounting and/or lowering production of the current product, both of which depress cash flow.

### Response:
","Companies pre-announce their future products because of the following reasons:
1. to reassure current customers that their product is improving
2. to comfort current customers that a lower cost model of their is coming
2. to increase the interest of the media and investors in the company's future prospects

What was the impact of Citizens United vs FEC on the impact of corporations funding politicians in the United States?

### Response:
","Citizens United vs Federal Election Commitee (FEC) was critical in enabling corporate funding from poorly disclosed sources under the 1st amendment. The Supreme Court blocked the motion from the FEC to restrict Citizens United on releasing a 90 minute documentary that was funded by corporate interests with a perspective and directive of voting against Hilary Clinton. The proximity to the election coming up made the FEC weary of large monied interests having a stake in public discourse and electioneering.

Citizens United ultimately won this case, and it has opened the floodgates for Billionaires to fund certain Super PACs (Political Action Committees) and has made it very hard to get large corporations out of Washington DC and Congress, which ultimately has undermined the will of the American public across the political spectrum."

The 1999 UEFA Champions League final was an association football match between Manchester United of England and Bayern Munich of Germany, played at Camp Nou in Barcelona, Spain, on 26 May 1999, to determine the winner of the 1998–99 UEFA Champions League. Injury time goals from Manchester United's Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær cancelled out Mario Basler's early goal for Bayern to give Manchester United a 2–1 win. Referee Pierluigi Collina has cited this match as one of the most memorable of his career, and described the noise from the crowd at the end of the game as being like a ""lion's roar"".

The two sides had played each other earlier in the competition, having both been drawn in Group D in the group stage; Bayern won the group, while Manchester United qualified for the knockout phase as one of the two best runners-up across all six groups. After beating Inter Milan in the quarter-finals, Manchester United beat another Italian side, Juventus, in the semis to reach the final; meanwhile, Bayern beat fellow Germans Kaiserslautern in the quarter-finals, before overcoming Ukrainian side Dynamo Kyiv in the semis. The victory completed a treble-winning season for Manchester United, after they had won the Premier League and FA Cup. Bayern were also playing for a treble, having won the Bundesliga and reached the DFB-Pokal final, although they went on to lose that match as well.

### Response:
","The 1999 Champions league final was won by Manchester United in dramatic fashion when they scored two goals in injury time. Teddy Sheringham and Ole Solskjaer scored late on for United after they'd conceded a goal early in the first half. The victory gave manchester United the ""treble"" and is considered one of the greatest achievements in the history of club football."

What is Nevada City known for?
European-Americans first settled Nevada City in 1849,[8] during the California Gold Rush, as Nevada (Spanish for ""snow-covered"", a reference to the snow-topped mountains in the area). The Gold Tunnel on the north side of Deer Creek was the city's first mine, built in 1850.[9] The first sawmill in Nevada City was built on Deer Creek, just above town, in August 1850, by Lewis & Son, with a water wheel.[10] In 1850–51, Nevada City was the state's most important mining town, and Nevada County the state's leading gold-mining county. In 1851, The Nevada Journal became the first newspaper published in the town and county.[11] The first cemetery in town, the Pioneer Cemetery, was founded around 1851 behind the Nevada City United Methodist Church, Nevada County's first denominational church.[12][13]

The town of Nevada was incorporated on April 19, 1856. In 1864, the word “City” was added to its name to relieve confusion with the nearby state of Nevada, and the town has legally been known as Nevada City ever since. The former town of Coyoteville later became Nevada City's northwestern section.[7][14]

### Response:
",Nevada City is a town in Northern California that was famous during the California Gold Rush that was first settled in 1849.

Why did the Prix Lupin not take place from 1915 to 1918?
The event was established in 1855, and it was originally called the Prix de l'Empereur. It was initially held at the Champ de Mars, and was transferred to Longchamp in 1857. It was cancelled due to the Franco-Prussian War in 1871, and was renamed the Grande Poule des Produits in 1872.

The race was one of several trials for the Prix du Jockey Club collectively known as the Poules des Produits. The others (listed by their modern titles) were the Prix Daru, the Prix Hocquart, the Prix Noailles and the Prix Greffulhe. Unlike those races, the Grande Poule des Produits had no restrictions based on the nationality of a horse's sire or dam.

The event was renamed in memory of Auguste Lupin (1807–1895), a successful owner-breeder, in 1896.

The Prix Lupin was abandoned throughout World War I, with no running from 1915 to 1918. It was cancelled once during World War II, in 1940. It was run at Le Tremblay over 2,150 metres in 1943, and at Maisons-Laffitte in 1944.

The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and the Prix Lupin was classed at Group 1 level.

The race was last run in 2004. It was discontinued after France Galop restructured its Group 1 programme for three-year-olds in 2005.

What is Twice's debut album?
Twice (Korean: 트와이스; RR: Teuwaiseu; Japanese: トゥワイス, Hepburn: Tuwaisu; commonly stylized as TWICE) is a South Korean girl group formed by JYP Entertainment. The group is composed of nine members: Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, Chaeyoung, and Tzuyu. Twice was formed under the television program Sixteen (2015) and debuted on October 20, 2015, with the extended play (EP) The Story Begins.

Twice rose to domestic fame in 2016 with their single ""Cheer Up"", which charted at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart, became the best-performing single of the year, and won ""Song of the Year"" at the Melon Music Awards and Mnet Asian Music Awards. Their next single, ""TT"", from their third EP Twicecoaster: Lane 1, topped the Gaon charts for four consecutive weeks. The EP was the highest selling Korean girl group album of 2016. Within 19 months after debut, Twice had already sold over 1.2 million units of their four EPs and special album. As of December 2020, the group has sold over 15 million albums cumulatively in South Korea and Japan.[1][2]

The group debuted in Japan on June 28, 2017, under Warner Music Japan, with the release of a compilation album titled #Twice.[3] The album charted at number 2 on the Oricon Albums Chart with the highest first-week album sales by a K-pop artist in Japan in two years. It was followed by the release of Twice's first original Japanese maxi single titled ""One More Time"" in October. Twice became the first Korean girl group to earn a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for both an album and CD single in the same year. Twice ranked third in the Top Artist category of Billboard Japan's 2017 Year-end Rankings, and in 2019, they became the first Korean girl group to embark on a Japanese dome tour.

Twice is the first female Korean act to simultaneously top both Billboard's World Albums and World Digital Song Sales charts with the release of their first studio album Twicetagram and its lead single ""Likey"" in 2017. With the release of their single ""Feel Special"" in 2019, Twice became the third female Korean act to chart into the Canadian Hot 100. After signing with Republic Records for American promotions as part of a partnership with JYP Entertainment, the group has charted into the US Billboard 200 with More & More and Eyes Wide Open in 2020, Taste of Love and Formula of Love: O+T=<3 in 2021, and Between 1&2 in 2022. Their first official English-language single, ""The Feels"", became their first song to enter the US Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart, peaking at the 83rd and 80th positions of the charts, respectively. They have been dubbed the next ""Nation's Girl Group"", and their point choreography—including for ""Cheer Up"" (2016), ""TT"" (2016), ""Signal"" (2017), and ""What Is Love?"" (2018)—became dance crazes and viral memes imitated by many celebrities.

### Response:
","You can add numbers by treating each number as a count of items and then counting all of the items to get a total result which is the sum of the numbers.  

The process of adding numbers is known as addition and is one of four basic maths operations.  This area of maths is known as arithmetic.

Counting the quantity of items is the same as repeatedly adding 1.

For example, adding the numbers two and three (or 2 + 3)  is the same as adding one (1) two times and then adding one (1) three times."

How many people are needed to perform the Turing test?
The Turing test, originally called the imitation game by Alan Turing in 1950,[2] is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. Turing proposed that a human evaluator would judge natural language conversations between a human and a machine designed to generate human-like responses. The evaluator would be aware that one of the two partners in conversation was a machine, and all participants would be separated from one another. The conversation would be limited to a text-only channel, such as a computer keyboard and screen, so the result would not depend on the machine's ability to render words as speech.[3] If the evaluator could not reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine would be said to have passed the test. The test results would not depend on the machine's ability to give correct answers to questions, only on how closely its answers resembled those a human would give.

### Response:
","You need two people: one person is the conversation partner to the machine. And another, the evaluator which observes the conversation from distance unaware which side is the machine and which side is human."

The islands are located in the eastern Pacific Ocean, 973 km (605 mi) off the west coast of South America. The majority of islands are also more broadly part of the South Pacific. The closest land mass is that of mainland Ecuador, the country to which they belong, 926 km (500 nmi) to the east.

NASA oceanographer Gene Carl Feldman reflects on his unique perspective on this region.
The islands are found at the coordinates 1°40'N–1°36'S, 89°16'–92°01'W. Straddling the equator, islands in the chain are located in both the northern and southern hemispheres, with Volcán Wolf and Volcán Ecuador on Isla Isabela being directly on the equator. Española Island, the southernmost islet of the archipelago, and Darwin Island, the northernmost one, are spread out over a distance of 220 km (137 mi). The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) considers them wholly within the South Pacific Ocean, however The Galápagos Archipelago consists of 7,880 km2 (3,040 sq mi) of land spread over 45,000 km2 (17,000 sq mi) of ocean. The largest of the islands, Isabela, measures 2,250 square miles (5,800 km2)and makes up close to three-quarters of the total land area of the Galápagos. Volcán Wolf on Isabela is the highest point, with an elevation of 1,707 m (5,600 ft) above sea level.

The group consists of 18 main islands, 3 smaller islands, and 107 rocks and islets. The islands are located at the Galapagos Triple Junction. The archipelago is located on the Nazca Plate (a tectonic plate), which is moving east/southeast, diving under the South American Plate at a rate of about 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) per year.It is also atop the Galápagos hotspot, a place where the Earth's crust is being melted from below by a mantle plume, creating volcanoes. The first islands formed here at least 8 million and possibly up to 90 million years ago.

While the older islands have disappeared below the sea as they moved away from the mantle plume, the youngest islands, Isabela and Fernandina, are still being formed. In April 2009, lava from the volcanic island Fernandina started flowing both towards the island's shoreline and into the center caldera.

In late June 2018, Sierra Negra, one of five volcanoes on Isabela and one of the most active in the Galapagos archipelago, began erupting for the first time since 2005. Lava flows made their way to the coastline, prompting the evacuation of about fifty nearby residents and restricting tourist access.

Based on the following passage where did plums, apricots and peaches originate?
Traditional dried fruit such as raisins, figs, dates, apricots and apples have been a staple of Mediterranean diets for millennia. This is due partly to their early cultivation in the Middle Eastern region known as the Fertile Crescent, made up by parts of modern Iran, Iraq, southwest Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, and northern Egypt. Drying or dehydration also happened to be the earliest form of food preservation: grapes, dates, and figs that fell from the tree or vine would dry in the hot sun. Early hunter-gatherers observed that these fallen fruit took on an edible form, and valued them for their stability as well as their concentrated sweetness. 
The earliest recorded mention of dried fruits can be found in Mesopotamian tablets dating to about 1500 BC, which contain what are probably the oldest known written recipes. These clay slabs, written in Akkadian, the daily language of Babylonia, were inscribed in cuneiform and tell of diets based on grains (barley, millet, wheat), vegetables and fruits such as dates, figs, apples, pomegranates, and grapes. These early civilizations used dates, date juice evaporated into syrup and raisins as sweeteners. They included dried fruits in their breads for which they had more than 300 recipes, from simple barley bread for the workers to very elaborate, spiced cakes with honey for the palaces and temples.
The date palm was one of the first cultivated trees. It was domesticated in Mesopotamia more than 5,000 years ago. It grew abundantly in the Fertile Crescent and it was so productive (an average date palm produces 50 kg (100 lbs) of fruit a year for 60 years or more) that dates were the cheapest of staple foods. Because they were so valuable, they were well recorded in Assyrian and Babylonian monuments and temples. The villagers in Mesopotamia dried them and ate them as sweets. Whether fresh, soft-dried or hard-dried, they helped to give character to meat dishes and grain pies. They were valued by travelers for their energy and were recommended as stimulants against fatigue.
Figs were also prized in early Mesopotamia, Palestine, Israel, and Egypt where their daily use was probably greater than or equal to that of dates. As well as appearing in wall paintings, many specimens have been found in Egyptian tombs as funerary offerings. In Greece and Crete, figs grew very readily and they were the staple of poor and rich alike, particularly in their dried form.
Grape cultivation first began in Armenia and the eastern regions of the Mediterranean in the 4th century BC. Raisins were produced by drying grapes in the hot desert sun. Very quickly, viticulture and raisin production spread across northern Africa including Morocco and Tunisia. The Phoenicians and the Egyptians popularized the production of raisins, probably due to the perfect arid environment for sun drying. They put them in jars for storage and allotted them to the different temples by the thousands. They also added them to breads and various pastries, some made with honey, some with milk and eggs.
From the Middle East, these fruits spread through Greece to Italy where they became a major part of the diet. Ancient Romans consumed raisins in spectacular quantities and at all levels of society, including them as a key part of their common meals, along with olives and fresh fruits. Raisined breads were common for breakfast and were consumed with their grains, beans, and cultured milks. Raisins were so valued that they transcended the food realm and became rewards for successful athletes, as well as premium barter currency.
Having dried fruits was essential in ancient Rome as these instructions for housekeepers around 100 BC tell: ""She must keep a supply of cooked food on hand for you and the servants. She must keep many hens and have plenty of eggs. She must have a large store of dried pears, sorbs, figs, raisins, sorbs in must, preserved pears and grapes and quinces. She must also keep preserved grapes in grape-pulp and in pots buried in the ground, as well as fresh Praenestine nuts kept in the same way, and Scantian quinces in jars, and other fruits that are usually preserved, as well as wild fruits. All these she must store away diligently every year.""
Figs were also extremely popular in Rome. Dried figs were added to bread and formed a major part of the winter food of country people. They were rubbed with spices such as cumin, anise and fennel seeds, or toasted sesame, wrapped in fig leaves and stored in jars. Today, major producing regions include Israel, Jerusalem, Gaza and many other Arabic countries. Dried figs are rich in vitamins, phosphorus and various other important minerals.
Plums, apricots and peaches had their origins in Asia. They were domesticated in China in the 3rd millennium BC and spread to the Fertile Crescent where they were also very popular, fresh and dried alike. They arrived in Greece and Italy much later and were very expensive but valued in the preparation of gourmet dishes with port or stewed with honey and spices.

Based on the reference text, provide a bulleted list summarizing Newton's three laws of motion
First
Translated from the Latin, Newton's first law reads,

Every body continues in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a straight line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed upon it.[13]: 114 
Newton's first law expresses the principle of inertia: the natural behavior of a body is to move in a straight line at constant speed. In the absence of outside influences, a body's motion preserves the status quo.

The modern understanding of Newton's first law is that no inertial observer is privileged over any other. The concept of an inertial observer makes quantitative the everyday idea of feeling no effects of motion. For example, a person standing on the ground watching a train go past is an inertial observer. If the observer on the ground sees the train moving smoothly in a straight line at a constant speed, then a passenger sitting on the train will also be an inertial observer: the train passenger feels no motion. The principle expressed by Newton's first law is that there is no way to say which inertial observer is ""really"" moving and which is ""really"" standing still. One observer's state of rest is another observer's state of uniform motion in a straight line, and no experiment can deem either point of view to be correct or incorrect. There is no absolute standard of rest.[note 4]

Second
The change of motion of an object is proportional to the force impressed; and is made in the direction of the straight line in which the force is impressed.[13]: 114 
By ""motion"", Newton meant the quantity now called momentum, which depends upon the amount of matter contained in a body, the speed at which that body is moving, and the direction in which it is moving. In modern notation, the momentum of a body is the product of its mass and its velocity:

Newton's second law, in modern form, states that the time derivative of the momentum is the force:
If the mass m does not change with time, then the derivative acts only upon the velocity, and so the force equals the product of the mass and the time derivative of the velocity, which is the acceleration:
As the acceleration is the second derivative of position with respect to time, this can also be written.

The forces acting on a body add as vectors, and so the total force on a body depends upon both the magnitudes and the directions of the individual forces. When the net force on a body is equal to zero, then by Newton's second law, the body does not accelerate, and it is said to be in mechanical equilibrium. A state of mechanical equilibrium is stable if, when the position of the body is changed slightly, the body remains near that equilibrium. Otherwise, the equilibrium is unstable.

A common visual representation of forces acting in concert is the free body diagram, which schematically portrays a body of interest and the forces applied to it by outside influences.[17] For example, a free body diagram of a block sitting upon an inclined plane can illustrate the combination of gravitational force, ""normal"" force, friction, and string tension.[note 5]

Newton's second law is sometimes presented as a definition of force, i.e., a force is that which exists when an inertial observer sees a body accelerating. In order for this to be more than a tautology — acceleration implies force, force implies acceleration — some other statement about force must also be made. For example, an equation detailing the force might be specified, like Newton's law of universal gravitation. By inserting such an expression for 
 into Newton's second law, an equation with predictive power can be written.[note 6] Newton's second law has also been regarded as setting out a research program for physics, establishing that important goals of the subject are to identify the forces present in nature and to catalogue the constituents of matter.[note 7]

Third
To every action, there is always opposed an equal reaction; or, the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts.[13]: 116 

Overly brief paraphrases of the third law, like ""action equals reaction"" might have caused confusion among generations of students: the ""action"" and ""reaction"" apply to different bodies. For example, consider a book at rest on a table. The Earth's gravity pulls down upon the book. The ""reaction"" to that ""action"" is not the support force from the table holding up the book, but the gravitational pull of the book acting on the Earth.[note 8]

Newton's third law relates to a more fundamental principle, the conservation of momentum. The latter remains true even in cases where Newton's statement does not, for instance when force fields as well as material bodies carry momentum, and when momentum is defined properly, in quantum mechanics as well.[note 9]
By Newton's second law, the first term is the total force upon the first body, and the second term is the total force upon the second body. If the two bodies are isolated from outside influences, the only force upon the first body can be that from the second, and vice versa. By Newton's third law, these forces have equal magnitude but opposite direction, so they cancel when added, and 
→{\vec {p}} is constant. Alternatively, if 
→{\vec {p}} is known to be constant, it follows that the forces have equal magnitude and opposite direction.

### Response:
","The following is a summary of Newton's three laws of motion:
1. First Law: A body remains at rest, or in motion at constant speed, unless acted upon by a force.
2. Second Law: The change of motion of an object is proportional to the force impressed on the object.
3. Third Law: To every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."

Why do people like cats?

### Response:
","Cats are very popular pets. Many people have cats. In fact, some will argue that cats are a better pet than a dog. Cats often bond with their favorite human and provide companionship and love. When a cat purrs, it releases endorphins in the cat, and that can also help calm a human and help them release endorphins, too. Cats are independent and sometimes aloof, which may be a deterrent to humans who haven't been around cats much, but they generally warm up and will be a great friend."

Given this summarized version of the Legend of the Christmas Spider, what turned the spider webs into precious metals?
A poor but hardworking widow once lived in a small hut with her children. One summer day, a pine cone fell on the earthen floor of the hut and took root. The widow's children cared for the tree, excited at the prospect of having a Christmas tree by winter. The tree grew, but when Christmas Eve arrived, they could not afford to decorate it. The children sadly went to bed and fell asleep. Early the next morning, they woke up and saw the tree covered with cobwebs. When they opened the windows, the first rays of sunlight touched the webs and turned them into gold and silver. The widow and her children were overjoyed. From then on, they never lived in poverty again.

What is cross-country skiing?

### Response:
","Cross-country (or ""nordic"") skiing, as opposed to downhill skiing, refer to the winter snow sport where the participant travels across relatively flat ground without the assistance of a chairlift or other machine aid in getting uphill. There are three main categories of cross-country ski available: classic, skate and touring, all of which come with specialized types of skies. Classic cross-country skiing involves a striding technique in which the skier keeps their skis parallel to each other and is best done in a narrow, groomed track. Skate skiing is considered more challenging to learn and involves a skiing technique that resembles the motion of ice skating and roller blading. Skate skiers also typically use a groomed trail but it is wider and smoother than the narrow grooves for classic skiing. Touring skis allows skiers to most easily ski off the trails on top of snow that has not been groomed."

Summarise the biography of Andrew Huberman and his most popular achievements.
Andrew D. Huberman is an American neuroscientist and tenured associate professor in the department of neurobiology and psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine who has made contributions to the brain development, brain plasticity, and neural regeneration and repair fields. Much of his work is focused on the visual system, including the mechanisms controlling light-mediated activation of the circadian and autonomic arousal centers in the brain, as well as brain control over conscious vision or sight.[1][2][better source needed] Huberman has been credited with coining the term ""Non-Sleep Deep Rest"" (NSDR), which he earlier referred to as Yog Nindra, which is to practices that place the brain and body into shallow sleep to accelerate neuroplasticity and help offset mental and physical fatigue.[3][4][5][better source needed]

Graduate and postdoctoral research
From 1998 to 2000, Huberman worked in the laboratory of Irving Zucker, as well as working with Marc Breedlove, at University of California, Berkeley, as part of a team that defined how early androgen exposure impacts development,[7] and he performed the first experiments defining the structure of binocular visual pathways that set the circadian clock in the hypothalamus.[8] From 2000 to 2004, working as a PhD student in the laboratory of Barbara Chapman at the Center for Neuroscience at the University of California, Davis, Huberman discovered that neural activity and axon guidance molecules work in concert to ensure proper wiring of binocular maps in the brain.[9][10][11] Huberman was a Helen Hay Whitney postdoctoral fellow researcher in the laboratory of Ben A. Barres from 2005 to 2010.[12]

Huberman was an assistant professor of neurobiology and neuroscience at University of California, San Diego, from 2011 to 2015. His lab pioneered using genetic tools to study the visual system function, development and disease.[13][14][15][16][17][18] Among the Huberman Lab's discoveries was the finding that specific types of retinal neurons degenerate early in glaucoma[19] a common blinding disease depleting sight in over 70 million people, for which there is no cure.

After moving to Stanford in 2016, Huberman discovered and published[20] the use of non-invasive methods such as visual stimulation to enhance regeneration of damaged retinal neurons, leading to partial recovery from blindness, especially when the stimulation is paired with specific forms of gene therapy. The work was covered extensively in the popular press, including Time magazine and Scientific American and is part of the National Eye Institute's Audacious Goals Initiative to restore vision to the blind[citation needed]. The Huberman Lab extended those findings to develop a human clinical trial using virtual reality technology to stimulate regeneration and plasticity of damaged retinal and other visual system neurons.[21]

In 2017, the Huberman Lab created a virtual reality platform for probing the neural mechanisms underlying pathological fear and anxiety. That work involved collecting 360-degree video of various fear-inducing scenarios such as heights and claustrophobia as well as atypical fear-inducing situations such as swimming with great white sharks. The Huberman VR platform is aimed at making discoveries that will lead to developing new tools for humans to adjust their state in order to promote adaptive coping with stress. The first installment of that work was published in Current Biology, in 2021[22] as a collaboration with neurosurgeon and neuroscientist Edward Chang (UCSF), wherein they reported that specific patterns of insular cortex brain activity correlate with and may predict anxiety responses.[23]

In May, 2018, Huberman Laboratory published an article[24] in the journal Nature reporting its discovery of two new mammalian brain circuits: one that promotes fear and paralysis, and another that promotes ""courageous""/confrontational reaction, to visually-evoked threats. That discovery prompted the now ongoing exploration of how these brain regions may be involved in humans suffering from anxiety-related disorders such as phobias and generalized anxiety.[25]

In 2020, Huberman initiated a collaboration with the laboratory of David Spiegel in the Stanford Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, to systematically study how particular patterns of respiration (i.e., breathing/breathwork) and the visual system influence the autonomic nervous system, stress, and other brain states, including sleep.[26][27][28]

In 2021, Huberman launched the ""Huberman Lab"" podcast with the goal of translating neuroscience into tools that can be applied in everyday life. It is a top podcast on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.[33][34] He was originally inspired to start the podcast after his appearance on the Lex Fridman Podcast.[35][36] Huberman also covers the evidence on supplements which include Tongkat Ali (Eurycoma Longifolia), Fadogia Agrestis and many others.[37][38]

Given a reference text about Francoist Spain, when did Franco rule Spain and when did he die?
Francoist Spain (Spanish: España franquista), or the Francoist dictatorship (dictadura franquista), was the period of Spanish history between 1939 and 1975, when Francisco Franco ruled Spain after the Spanish Civil War with the title Caudillo. After his death in 1975, Spain transitioned into a democracy. During this time period, Spain was officially known as the Spanish State (Estado Español).

The nature of the regime evolved and changed during its existence. Months after the start of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936, Franco emerged as the dominant rebel military leader and was proclaimed head of state on 1 October 1936, ruling a dictatorship over the territory controlled by the Nationalist faction. The 1937 Unification Decree, which merged all parties supporting the rebel side, led to Nationalist Spain becoming a single-party regime under the FET y de las JONS. The end of the war in 1939 brought the extension of the Franco rule to the whole country and the exile of Republican institutions. The Francoist dictatorship originally took a form described as ""fascistized dictatorship"",[2] or ""semi-fascist regime"",[3] showing clear influence of fascism in fields such as labor relations, the autarkic economic policy, aesthetics, and the single-party system.[4][5] As time went on, the regime opened up and became closer to developmental dictatorships, although it always preserved residual fascist elements.[6][3]

### Response:
",Francisco Franco ruled Spain from 1935 until he died in 1975.

What happened in Woodstock
Woodstock Music and Art Fair, commonly referred to as Woodstock, was a music festival held during August 15–18, 1969, on Max Yasgur's dairy farm in Bethel, New York, United States,[3][4] 40 miles (65 km) southwest of the town of Woodstock. Billed as ""an Aquarian Exposition: 3 Days of Peace & Music"" and alternatively referred to as the Woodstock Rock Festival, it attracted an audience of more than 400,000 attendees.[3][5][6][7] Thirty-two acts performed outdoors despite sporadic rain.[8] It was one of the largest music festivals held in history.[9][10][11]

The festival has become widely regarded as a pivotal moment in popular music history as well as a defining event for the counterculture generation.[12][13] The event's significance was reinforced by a 1970 documentary film,[14] an accompanying soundtrack album, and a song written by Joni Mitchell that became a major hit for both Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and Matthews Southern Comfort. Musical events bearing the Woodstock name were planned for anniversaries, which included the tenth, twentieth, twenty-fifth, thirtieth, fortieth, and fiftieth. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine listed it as number 19 of the 50 Moments That Changed the History of Rock and Roll.[15] In 2017, the festival site became listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[16]

Why is MPPT necessary?
Maximum power point tracking (MPPT)[1][2] or sometimes just power point tracking (PPT),[3][4] is a technique used with variable power sources to maximize energy extraction as conditions vary. The technique is most commonly used with photovoltaic (PV) solar systems, but can also be used with wind turbines, optical power transmission and thermophotovoltaics.

PV solar systems have varying relationships to inverter systems, external grids, battery banks, and other electrical loads.[5] The central problem addressed by MPPT is that the efficiency of power transfer from the solar cell depends on the amount of available sunlight, shading, solar panel temperature and the load's electrical characteristics. As these conditions vary, the load characteristic (impedance) that gives the highest power transfer changes. The system is optimized when the load characteristic changes to keep power transfer at highest efficiency. This optimal load characteristic is called the maximum power point (MPP). MPPT is the process of adjusting the load characteristic as the conditions change. Circuits can be designed to present optimal loads to the photovoltaic cells and then convert the voltage, current, or frequency to suit other devices or systems.

Solar cells' non-linear relationship between temperature and total resistance can be analyzed based on the Current-voltage (I-V) curve and the power-voltage (P-V) curves.[6][7] MPPT samples cell output and applies the proper resistance (load) to obtain maximum power.[8] MPPT devices are typically integrated into an electric power converter system that provides voltage or current conversion, filtering, and regulation for driving various loads, including power grids, batteries, or motors. Solar inverters convert DC power to AC power and may incorporate MPPT.

The power at the MPP (Pmpp) is the product of the MPP voltage (Vmpp) and MPP current (Impp).

In general, the P-V curve of a partially shaded solar array can have multiple peaks, and some algorithms can get stuck in a local maximum rather than the global maximum of the curve.[9]

### Response:
",The efficiency of transferring the power from the photovoltaic (PV) solar systems depends on many factors which change frequently. MPPT system purpose is to continuously adjust the parameters under which the system work to achieve the most efficient transfer of power from the solar system to the load.

Who really invented the telephone ?
Credit for the invention of the electric telephone is frequently disputed, and new controversies over the issue have arisen from time to time. Antonio Meucci, Alexander Graham Bell, and Elisha Gray amongst others, have all been credited with the telephone's invention. The early history of the telephone became and still remains a confusing morass of claims and counterclaims, which were not clarified by the huge number of lawsuits filed in order to resolve the patent claims of the many individuals and commercial competitors. The Bell and Edison patents, however, were commercially decisive, because they dominated telephone technology and were upheld by court decisions in the United States.

The modern telephone is the result of the work of many people. Alexander Graham Bell was, however, the first to patent the telephone, as an ""apparatus for transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically"". Bell has most often been credited as the inventor of the first practical telephone. Johann Philipp Reis coined the term ""telephon"". Models of it were sent abroad, to London, Dublin, Tiflis, and other places. It became a subject for popular lectures, and an article for scientific cabinets. Edison credited him as the ""first inventor of the telephone."" The Italian-American inventor and businessman Antonio Meucci has been recognized by the U.S. House of Representatives for his contributory work on the telephone. Several other controversies also surround the question of priority of invention for the telephone.
The Elisha Gray and Alexander Bell telephone controversy considers the question of whether Bell and Gray invented the telephone independently and, if not, whether Bell stole the invention from Gray. This controversy is narrower than the broader question of who deserves credit for inventing the telephone, for which there are several claimants.

### Response:
","The telephone invention is a result of many contributions across the years. The most well-known, Antonio Meucci, Alexander Graham Bell, and Elisha Gray helped provided their knowledge and works to create the telephone as we know it today. Several people claimed credit for this creation but we can easily say that this invention is the fruit of humanity's collaboration to ease communication and get people closer across the globe."

Where does the name Gibraltar come from?
Gibraltar (/dʒɪˈbrɔːltər/ jih-BRAWL-tər, Spanish: [xiβɾalˈtaɾ]) is a British Overseas Territory and city[6] located at the southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula.[7][8][a] It has an area of 6.7 km2 (2.6 sq mi) and is bordered to the north by Spain. The landscape is dominated by the Rock of Gibraltar, at the foot of which is a densely populated town area, home to over 32,000 people, primarily Gibraltarians.[10]

In 1704, Anglo-Dutch forces captured Gibraltar from Spain during the War of the Spanish Succession. The territory was ceded to Great Britain in perpetuity under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. It became an important base for the Royal Navy, particularly during the Napoleonic Wars and World War II, as it controlled the narrow entrance and exit to the Mediterranean Sea, the Strait of Gibraltar, which is only 14.3 km (8.9 mi) wide. This choke point remains strategically important, with half the world's seaborne trade passing through it.[11][12][13] Gibraltar's economy is based largely on tourism, online gambling, financial services, and bunkering.[14][15][16][17]

The sovereignty of Gibraltar is a point of contention in Anglo-Spanish relations, as Spain asserts a claim to the territory.[15][18] Gibraltarians overwhelmingly rejected proposals for Spanish sovereignty in a 1967 referendum, and for shared sovereignty in a 2002 referendum. Nevertheless, Gibraltar maintains close economic and cultural links with Spain, with many Gibraltarians speaking Spanish as well as a local dialect known as Llanito.

Since Brexit, Gibraltar is not a member of the European Union but negotiations are underway to have it participate in the Schengen Agreement to facilitate border movements between Gibraltar and Spain.[19] As of March 2023, talks seem deadlocked.[20]

Magnesium is a chemical element with the symbol Mg and atomic number 12. It is a shiny gray metal having a low density, low melting point and high chemical reactivity. Like the other alkaline earth metals (group 2 of the periodic table) it occurs naturally only in combination with other elements and it almost always has an oxidation state of +2. It reacts readily with air to form a thin passivation coating of magnesium oxide that inhibits further corrosion of the metal. The free metal burns with a brilliant-white light. The metal is obtained mainly by electrolysis of magnesium salts obtained from brine. It is less dense than aluminium and is used primarily as a component in strong and lightweight alloys that contain aluminium.

### Response:
",Magnesium is mainly obtained by electrolysis of magnesium salts obtained from brine.

Is Hainanese chicken rice a national dish of Singapore or Malaysia?
Hainanese chicken rice is a dish of poached chicken and seasoned rice, served with chilli sauce and usually with cucumber garnishes. It was created by immigrants from Hainan in southern China and adapted from the Hainanese dish Wenchang chicken. It is considered one of the national dishes of Singapore and is most commonly associated with Singaporean cuisine, being widely available in most food courts and hawker centres around the country. Variants of the dish can also be seen throughout Southeast Asia, particularly in Malaysia and Thailand, where it remains a culinary staple. In a debate that stretches back decades to 1965, when the two countries split, Malaysia and Singapore have both laid claim to inventing the dish. In 2009, then Malaysian Tourism Minister Ng Yen Yen said that Hainanese chicken rice was ""uniquely Malaysian"" and had been ""hijacked"" by other countries. Ng later clarified that she was misquoted on her intention to patent the foods, and that a study on the origins of the foods would be conducted ""and an apology conveyed if it was wrongly claimed."" In 2018, then Malaysian Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng joked that Singapore claimed ""chicken rice is theirs (and) if we’re not careful, ‘char koay teow‘ will become theirs"" one day. The debate has been described as an example of gastronationalism.

### Response:
","The answer might differ depending on who is answering your question. Hainanese chicken rice is considered one of the national dishes of Singapore being widely available in most food courts and hawker centres around the country.

List the 6 naturally occurring noble gases.
The noble gases (historically also the inert gases; sometimes referred to as aerogens) make up a class of chemical elements with similar properties; under standard conditions, they are all odorless, colorless, monatomic gases with very low chemical reactivity. The six naturally occurring noble gases are helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and the radioactive radon (Rn).
Oganesson (Og) is a synthetically produced highly radioactive element. Although IUPAC has used the term ""noble gas"" interchangeably with ""group 18"" and thus included oganesson, it may not be significantly chemically noble and is predicted to break the trend and be reactive due to relativistic effects. Because of the extremely short 0.7 ms half-life of its only known isotope, its chemistry has not yet been investigated.
For the first six periods of the periodic table, the noble gases are exactly the members of group 18. Noble gases are typically highly unreactive except when under particular extreme conditions. The inertness of noble gases makes them very suitable in applications where reactions are not wanted. For example, argon is used in incandescent lamps to prevent the hot tungsten filament from oxidizing; also, helium is used in breathing gas by deep-sea divers to prevent oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide toxicity.
The properties of the noble gases can be well explained by modern theories of atomic structure: Their outer shell of valence electrons is considered to be ""full"", giving them little tendency to participate in chemical reactions, and it has been possible to prepare only a few hundred noble gas compounds. The melting and boiling points for a given noble gas are close together, differing by less than 10 °C (18 °F); that is, they are liquids over only a small temperature range.
Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon are obtained from air in an air separation unit using the methods of liquefaction of gases and fractional distillation. Helium is sourced from natural gas fields that have high concentrations of helium in the natural gas, using cryogenic gas separation techniques, and radon is usually isolated from the radioactive decay of dissolved radium, thorium, or uranium compounds. Noble gases have several important applications in industries such as lighting, welding, and space exploration. A helium-oxygen breathing gas is often used by deep-sea divers at depths of seawater over 55 m (180 ft). After the risks caused by the flammability of hydrogen became apparent in the Hindenburg disaster, it was replaced with helium in blimps and balloons.

### Response:
","The six naturally occurring noble gases are:
1. Helium (He)
2. Neon (Ne)
3. Argon (Ar)
4. Krypton (Kr)

### Instruction:
Based on the following passage, extract recorded instructions for housekeepers from around 100 BC.
Traditional dried fruit such as raisins, figs, dates, apricots and apples have been a staple of Mediterranean diets for millennia. This is due partly to their early cultivation in the Middle Eastern region known as the Fertile Crescent, made up by parts of modern Iran, Iraq, southwest Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, and northern Egypt. Drying or dehydration also happened to be the earliest form of food preservation: grapes, dates, and figs that fell from the tree or vine would dry in the hot sun. Early hunter-gatherers observed that these fallen fruit took on an edible form, and valued them for their stability as well as their concentrated sweetness. 
The earliest recorded mention of dried fruits can be found in Mesopotamian tablets dating to about 1500 BC, which contain what are probably the oldest known written recipes. These clay slabs, written in Akkadian, the daily language of Babylonia, were inscribed in cuneiform and tell of diets based on grains (barley, millet, wheat), vegetables and fruits such as dates, figs, apples, pomegranates, and grapes. These early civilizations used dates, date juice evaporated into syrup and raisins as sweeteners. They included dried fruits in their breads for which they had more than 300 recipes, from simple barley bread for the workers to very elaborate, spiced cakes with honey for the palaces and temples.
The date palm was one of the first cultivated trees. It was domesticated in Mesopotamia more than 5,000 years ago. It grew abundantly in the Fertile Crescent and it was so productive (an average date palm produces 50 kg (100 lbs) of fruit a year for 60 years or more) that dates were the cheapest of staple foods. Because they were so valuable, they were well recorded in Assyrian and Babylonian monuments and temples. The villagers in Mesopotamia dried them and ate them as sweets. Whether fresh, soft-dried or hard-dried, they helped to give character to meat dishes and grain pies. They were valued by travelers for their energy and were recommended as stimulants against fatigue.
Figs were also prized in early Mesopotamia, Palestine, Israel, and Egypt where their daily use was probably greater than or equal to that of dates. As well as appearing in wall paintings, many specimens have been found in Egyptian tombs as funerary offerings. In Greece and Crete, figs grew very readily and they were the staple of poor and rich alike, particularly in their dried form.
Grape cultivation first began in Armenia and the eastern regions of the Mediterranean in the 4th century BC. Raisins were produced by drying grapes in the hot desert sun. Very quickly, viticulture and raisin production spread across northern Africa including Morocco and Tunisia. The Phoenicians and the Egyptians popularized the production of raisins, probably due to the perfect arid environment for sun drying. They put them in jars for storage and allotted them to the different temples by the thousands. They also added them to breads and various pastries, some made with honey, some with milk and eggs.
From the Middle East, these fruits spread through Greece to Italy where they became a major part of the diet. Ancient Romans consumed raisins in spectacular quantities and at all levels of society, including them as a key part of their common meals, along with olives and fresh fruits. Raisined breads were common for breakfast and were consumed with their grains, beans, and cultured milks. Raisins were so valued that they transcended the food realm and became rewards for successful athletes, as well as premium barter currency.
Having dried fruits was essential in ancient Rome as these instructions for housekeepers around 100 BC tell: ""She must keep a supply of cooked food on hand for you and the servants. She must keep many hens and have plenty of eggs. She must have a large store of dried pears, sorbs, figs, raisins, sorbs in must, preserved pears and grapes and quinces. She must also keep preserved grapes in grape-pulp and in pots buried in the ground, as well as fresh Praenestine nuts kept in the same way, and Scantian quinces in jars, and other fruits that are usually preserved, as well as wild fruits. All these she must store away diligently every year.""
Figs were also extremely popular in Rome. Dried figs were added to bread and formed a major part of the winter food of country people. They were rubbed with spices such as cumin, anise and fennel seeds, or toasted sesame, wrapped in fig leaves and stored in jars. Today, major producing regions include Israel, Jerusalem, Gaza and many other Arabic countries. Dried figs are rich in vitamins, phosphorus and various other important minerals.
Plums, apricots and peaches had their origins in Asia. They were domesticated in China in the 3rd millennium BC and spread to the Fertile Crescent where they were also very popular, fresh and dried alike. They arrived in Greece and Italy much later and were very expensive but valued in the preparation of gourmet dishes with port or stewed with honey and spices.

What is orange wine?

### Response:
","Orange wine is a term given to white wines that have ""skin contact"" during the wine making process. Unlike true white wines, where contact between the pressed white grape juice and the white grape skins is minimised, for an orange wine the pressed juice will macerate with the skins, similar to the process for making a red wine. The depth of colour and the level of tannin present in the resulting wine will be determined, largely, by the length of this maceration. Due to the presence of tannin, orange wines can often taste ""funky"" compared to white wines, and are very popular with proponents of the natural wine movement."

Given a reference text about Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries of Denmark, when was the position created and was was it named?
Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries of Denmark (Danish: Minister for Fødevarer, Landbrug og Fiskeri) is the politically appointed head of the Danish Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, and a member of the Cabinet. Since 19 November 2020, Rasmus Prehn, from the social democratic party Socialdemokratiet, has served as Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries in the Mette Frederiksen I cabinet.[1]

The ministry and the minister post was created in 1896; the ministry was originally named the Ministry of Agriculture. In 1929 the Directorate of Fishing was spun off into the separate Ministry of Shipping and Fishing, but that ministry was reabsorbed in 1935, and the name changed to Ministry of Agriculture and Fishing. In 1947 the Ministry of Fishing was created again, and the name changed to the Ministry of Agriculture, and this time it lasted until 1994 where it was again folded into the Ministry of Agriculture and Fishing. On 30 December 1996 the name of the ministry was changed to the current Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, often just called the Ministry of Food.

What events did John James Monckton set the world record for?
John James Monckton (28 October 1938 – 29 June 2017)[1] was an Australian backstroke swimmer who won a silver medal in the 100-metre event at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. Although he set multiple world records, he never won an Olympic gold medal.[2]

An apprentice carpenter from the New England region of New South Wales, Monckton appeared to be primed to win gold at the 1956 Olympics. At the national team camp in Townsville before the games, he became the first person to swim 400-metre backstroke in under five minutes. Although it was not a regularly contested event at international level, it was a promising sign for the event to be included for medal competition in the Olympics. He also set world records in the 110- and 220-yard freestyle events.

At the Olympics, Monckton was the fastest qualifier in the heats and semifinal, but was upstaged in the final by teammate David Theile.[2]

In the absence of Theile, who had retired after the Olympics to study medicine at university, Monckton dominated backstroke swimming, winning the 110-yard backstroke event at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff and also the 4×110-yard medley relay.[2] Monckton then prepared for another Olympics in 1960 in Rome, with Theile deferring his studies to defend his Olympic title. Monckton again led the qualifying in the heats and semifinals. However, in the final, he misjudged the turn and broke a finger. He limped home in seventh position, with Theile successfully defending his title.[3] Monckton continued competing in the hope of reaching a third Olympics in 1964, but retired after his performances began to deteriorate.

He married Maureen Giles, an Australian swimmer at the 1956 Olympics.[4]

He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1999.[5]

The Monckton Aquatic Centre in his hometown of Armidale is named for him.

What does this mean: ""Steady-state theory""?

### Response:
","In cosmology, the steady-state model, or steady state theory, is an alternative to the Big Bang theory of the evolution of the universe. In the steady-state model, the density of matter in an expanding universe stays the same because matter is always being made. This fits with the perfect cosmological principle, which says that the universe we can see is pretty much the same everywhere and at any time. 

Problems with the steady-state model began to emerge in the 1950s and 60s, when observations began to support the idea that the universe was in fact changing: bright radio sources (quasars and radio galaxies) were found only at large distances (therefore could have existed only in the distant past due to the effects of the speed of light on astronomy), not in closer galaxies. 

The discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1964, which the Big Bang theory had predicted, provided the majority of cosmologists with a conclusive challenge to the steady-state model."

Given the reference text about Fidel Castro, tell me where he was born, where he studied, and when he was the leader of Cuba.
Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz (/ˈkæstroʊ/;[1] American Spanish: [fiˈðel aleˈxandɾo ˈkastɾo ˈrus]; 13 August 1926 – 25 November 2016) was a Cuban revolutionary and politician who was the leader of Cuba from 1959 to 2008, serving as the prime minister of Cuba from 1959 to 1976 and president from 1976 to 2008. Ideologically a Marxist–Leninist and Cuban nationalist, he also served as the first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba from 1961 until 2011. Under his administration, Cuba became a one-party communist state; industry and business were nationalized, and socialist reforms were implemented throughout society.

Born in Birán, the son of a wealthy Spanish farmer, Castro adopted leftist and anti-imperialist ideas while studying law at the University of Havana. After participating in rebellions against right-wing governments in the Dominican Republic and Colombia, he planned the overthrow of Cuban President Fulgencio Batista, launching a failed attack on the Moncada Barracks in 1953. After a year's imprisonment, Castro travelled to Mexico where he formed a revolutionary group, the 26th of July Movement, with his brother Raúl Castro and Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara. Returning to Cuba, Castro took a key role in the Cuban Revolution by leading the Movement in a guerrilla war against Batista's forces from the Sierra Maestra. After Batista's overthrow in 1959, Castro assumed military and political power as Cuba's prime minister. The United States came to oppose Castro's government and unsuccessfully attempted to remove him by assassination, economic embargo, and counter-revolution, including the Bay of Pigs Invasion of 1961. Countering these threats, Castro aligned with the Soviet Union and allowed the Soviets to place nuclear weapons in Cuba, resulting in the Cuban Missile Crisis – a defining incident of the Cold War – in 1962.

How long did dinosaurs rule earth?
Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles[note 1] of the clade Dinosauria. They first appeared during the Triassic period, between 245 and 233.23 million years ago (mya), although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is a subject of active research. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201.3 mya and their dominance continued throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. The fossil record shows that birds are feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier theropods during the Late Jurassic epoch, and are the only dinosaur lineage known to have survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event approximately 66 mya. Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs—birds—and the extinct non-avian dinosaurs, which are all dinosaurs other than birds.

### Response:
",Dinosaurs were the dominant terrestrial species on earth for about 135.3 million years.

Should I pursue a PhD in STEM?

### Response:
","Whether or not to pursue a PhD will depend on a number of factors. These days, many professions require more and more certification and proof of education. However, a PhD is usually only require in the STEM field for positions that are either focussed on research, such as a research scientist position, or on a specialized field, such as many 'wet labs' in biological research, or more specialized knowledge jobs. Other than these roles, a Master's or other accreditation like professional certificates/MBAs etc. can be used for career advancement. For those interested in an academic career, a PhD is still the fundamental requirement. 

If you do choose to do a PhD, where you do a PhD will influence the amount and type of work that you do. For example, in the EU, the UK, Australia, and some other places, a PhD is usually three years of research with no or minimal extra course work. In the US, though, a PhD typically takes over 4 years and requires the student to take several classes at a graduate level. 
While in your program, you will need to spend a lot of time focusing on publication pressures. PhD students, these days, are required to produced 1-3 papers during their PhD in high impact journals. In many institutions, this is a high stress environment and can lead to increased mental health stress. If you are passionate and build a strong social structure, this can be an enjoyable experience, albeit a trying one."

From the passage identify the usage of Limestone. Display the results in a numbered list format.
Limestone (calcium carbonate CaCO3) is a type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime. It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of CaCO3. Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes, though biological processes, such as the accumulation of corals and shells in the sea, have likely been more important for the last 540 million years.[1][2] Limestone often contains fossils which provide scientists with information on ancient environments and on the evolution of life.[3]About 20% to 25% of sedimentary rock is carbonate rock, and most of this is limestone.[4][3] The remaining carbonate rock is mostly dolomite, a closely related rock, which contains a high percentage of the mineral dolomite, CaMg(CO3)2. Magnesian limestone is an obsolete and poorly-defined term used variously for dolomite, for limestone containing significant dolomite (dolomitic limestone), or for any other limestone containing a significant percentage of magnesium.[5] Most limestone was formed in shallow marine environments, such as continental shelves or platforms, though smaller amounts were formed in many other environments. Much dolomite is secondary dolomite, formed by chemical alteration of limestone.[6][7] Limestone is exposed over large regions of the Earth's surface, and because limestone is slightly soluble in rainwater, these exposures often are eroded to become karst landscapes. Most cave systems are found in limestone bedrock.Limestone has numerous uses: as a chemical feedstock for the production of lime used for cement (an essential component of concrete), as aggregate for the base of roads, as white pigment or filler in products such as toothpaste or paints, as a soil conditioner, and as a popular decorative addition to rock gardens. Limestone formations contain about 30% of the world's petroleum reservoirs.[3]

Which epic poem discussed the Trojan Horse?
The Trojan Horse was a wooden horse said to have been used by the Greeks during the Trojan War to enter the city of Troy and win the war. The Trojan Horse is not mentioned in Homer's Iliad, with the poem ending before the war is concluded, and it is only briefly mentioned in the Odyssey. But in the Aeneid by Virgil, after a fruitless 10-year siege, the Greeks constructed a huge wooden horse at the behest of Odysseus, and hid a select force of men inside, including Odysseus himself. The Greeks pretended to sail away, and the Trojans pulled the horse into their city as a victory trophy. That night, the Greek force crept out of the horse and opened the gates for the rest of the Greek army, which had sailed back under the cover of darkness. The Greeks entered and destroyed the city, ending the war.

Write instructions to a dog sitter for a dog named Chunkie

### Response:
","Thanks for coming over to spend time with Chunkie! Here is a summary of tips / directions

Hearing - Chunkie is deaf; you’ll need to make eye contact and hand gestures or grab her by the neck to give her gentle guidance. 

Stairs - Chunkie can’t take the front stairs given her arthritis, you’ll need to go out the sliding door (remove lock bar at the bottom), out the backyard gate to the left, and down the slide stairs. It’s ok to leave the sliding door unlocked during your walk. Go back in this way too. 

Walking - Try walking her to the Women’s garden and back. Her lease and poop bags are on the floor next to the sliding door. She doesn’t really walk fast or far anymore so if she doesn’t want to walk just take her back home. 

Other dogs - Chunkie doesn’t really like other dogs so keep her leash tight when other dogs are around. She does love people and is very safe w/ other people and kids.

Snack - You may feed her a snack - one pig ear and a few of the other smaller snacks. I’ll leave the snacks on the kitchen counter.

Water - Please refill her water bowls when you get there and make sure they are full before you leave (purple bowl in the dining room next to the window and silver bowl near sliding door).

Home - Feel free to make yourself at home! Chunkie usually hangs in my office / the TV room. She does need some help getting up the 2 stairs from that room and the main great room.

Locking up - Please put the lock bar back on the sliding door, leave the key on the kitchen counter (or on the bottom stairs as you exit) and lock the front door by depressing the door handle button."

Please explain about formula1 qualifying.
Qualifying
For much of the sport's history, qualifying sessions differed little from practice sessions; drivers would have one or more sessions in which to set their fastest time, with the grid order determined by each driver's best single lap, with the fastest getting first place on the grid, referred to as pole position. From 1996 to 2002, the format was a one-hour shootout. This approach lasted until the end of 2002 before the rules were changed again because the teams were not running in the early part of the session to take advantage of better track conditions later on.[75]

Grids were generally limited to 26 cars – if the race had more entries, qualification would also decide which drivers would start the race. During the early 1990s, the number of entries was so high that the worst-performing teams had to enter a pre-qualifying session, with the fastest cars allowed through to the main qualifying session. The qualifying format began to change in the early 2000s, with the FIA experimenting with limiting the number of laps, determining the aggregate time over two sessions, and allowing each driver only one qualifying lap.

The current qualifying system was adopted in the 2006 season. Known as ""knock-out"" qualifying, it is split into three periods, known as Q1, Q2, and Q3. In each period, drivers run qualifying laps to attempt to advance to the next period, with the slowest drivers being ""knocked out"" of qualification (but not necessarily the race) at the end of the period and their grid positions set within the rearmost five based on their best lap times. Drivers are allowed as many laps as they wish within each period. After each period, all times are reset, and only a driver's fastest lap in that period (barring infractions) counts. Any timed lap started before the end of that period may be completed, and will count toward that driver's placement. The number of cars eliminated in each period is dependent on the total number of cars entered into the championship.[76]

Currently, with 20 cars, Q1 runs for 18 minutes, and eliminates the slowest five drivers. During this period, any driver whose best lap takes longer than 107% of the fastest time in Q1 will not be allowed to start the race without permission from the stewards. Otherwise, all drivers proceed to the race albeit in the worst starting positions. This rule does not affect drivers in Q2 or Q3. In Q2, the 15 remaining drivers have 15 minutes to set one of the ten fastest times and proceed to the next period. Finally, Q3 lasts 12 minutes and sees the remaining ten drivers decide the first ten grid positions. At the beginning of the 2016 Formula 1 season, the FIA introduced a new qualifying format, whereby drivers were knocked out every 90 seconds after a certain amount of time had passed in each session. The aim was to mix up grid positions for the race, but due to unpopularity, the FIA reverted to the above qualifying format for the Chinese GP, after running the format for only two races.[76]

Each car is allocated one set of the softest tyres for use in Q3. The cars that qualify for Q3 must return them after Q3; the cars that do not qualify for Q3 can use them during the race.[77] As of 2022, all drivers are given a free choice of tyre to use at the start of the Grand Prix,[78] whereas in previous years only the drivers that did not participate in Q3 had free tyre choice for the start of the race. Any penalties that affect grid position are applied at the end of qualifying. Grid penalties can be applied for driving infractions in the previous or current Grand Prix, or for changing a gearbox or engine component. If a car fails scrutineering, the driver will be excluded from qualifying but will be allowed to start the race from the back of the grid at the race steward's discretion.

2021 has seen the trialling of a 'sprint qualifying' race on the Saturday of three race weekends, with the intention of testing the new approach to qualifying.[79]

### Response:
","Qualifying split into three period, known as Q1, Q2, and Q3.

Q2- the remaining 15 drivers have 15 minutes. another five slowest drivers are eliminated

Extract the various manufacturers and suppliers of the Tomahawk missile and separate them by comma
The Tomahawk (/ˈtɒməhɔːk/) Land Attack Missile (TLAM) is a long-range, all-weather, jet-powered, subsonic cruise missile that is primarily used by the United States Navy and Royal Navy in ship and submarine-based land-attack operations.

Under contract from the U.S. Navy, the Tomahawk was designed at the APL/JHU in a project led by James Walker near Laurel, Maryland, and was first manufactured by General Dynamics in the 1970s. It was intended to fill the role of a medium- to long-range, low-altitude missile that could be launched from a naval surface warfare platform, and featured a modular design accommodating a wide variety of warhead, guidance, and range capabilities. At least six variants and multiple upgraded versions of the TLAM have been added since the original design was introduced, including air-, sub-, and ground-launched variants with conventional and nuclear armaments. In 1992–1994, McDonnell Douglas Corporation was the sole supplier of Tomahawk Missiles and produced Block II and Block III Tomahawk missiles and remanufactured many Tomahawks to Block III specifications.[10] In 1994, Hughes outbid McDonnell Douglas Aerospace to become the sole supplier of Tomahawk missiles. By 2019, the only variants in service were non-nuclear, sea-launched variants manufactured by Raytheon.[11] In 2016, the U.S. Department of Defense purchased 149 Tomahawk Block IV missiles for $202.3 million.[3]

Give me the main facts about the book series about Harry Potter.
Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's conflict with Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).

The series was originally published in English by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom and Scholastic Press in the United States. All versions around the world are printed by Grafica Veneta in Italy.[1] A series of many genres, including fantasy, drama, coming-of-age fiction, and the British school story (which includes elements of mystery, thriller, adventure, horror, and romance), the world of Harry Potter explores numerous themes and includes many cultural meanings and references.[2] According to Rowling, the main theme is death.[3] Other major themes in the series include prejudice, corruption, and madness.[4]

Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June 1997, the books have found immense popularity, positive reviews, and commercial success worldwide. They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers and are widely considered cornerstones of modern literature.[5][6] As of February 2023, the books have sold more than 600 million copies worldwide, making them the best-selling book series in history, and have been available in 85 languages.[7] The last four books consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history, with the final instalment selling roughly 2.7 million copies in the United Kingdom and 8.3 million copies in the United States within twenty-four hours of its release.

The original seven books were adapted into an eight-part namesake film series by Warner Bros. Pictures. In 2016, the total value of the Harry Potter franchise was estimated at $25 billion,[8] making Harry Potter one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a play based on a story co-written by Rowling.

The success of the books and films has allowed the Harry Potter franchise to expand with numerous derivative works, a travelling exhibition that premiered in Chicago in 2009, a studio tour in London that opened in 2012, a digital platform on which J. K. Rowling updates the series with new information and insight, and a pentalogy of spin-off films premiering in November 2016 with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, among many other developments. Themed attractions, collectively known as The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, have been built at several Universal Destinations & Experiences amusement parks around the world.

Why do teenagers disappoint their parents?

### Response:
","Teenagers by definition are going through a process of maturation and individuation. They are finding their true self, distinct from their parents who have been their role model since infancy. Part of this process requires pushing boundaries set by parents. Parents often interpret this as disobedience and are disappointed. In fact teenagers who seem to be disappointing their parents are merely going through the healthy process of self identification."

### Instruction:
Linux Second-stage boot loader
Second-stage boot loaders, such as GNU GRUB, rEFInd, BOOTMGR, Syslinux, NTLDR or iBoot, are not themselves operating systems, but are able to load an operating system properly and transfer execution to it; the operating system subsequently initializes itself and may load extra device drivers. The second-stage boot loader does not need drivers for its own operation, but may instead use generic storage access methods provided by system firmware such as the BIOS or Open Firmware, though typically with restricted hardware functionality and lower performance.

Many boot loaders can be configured to give the user multiple booting choices. These choices can include different operating systems (for dual or multi-booting from different partitions or drives), different versions of the same operating system (in case a new version has unexpected problems), different operating system loading options (e.g., booting into a rescue or safe mode), and some standalone programs that can function without an operating system, such as memory testers (e.g., memtest86+), a basic shell (as in GNU GRUB), or even games (see List of PC Booter games).Some boot loaders can also load other boot loaders; for example, GRUB loads BOOTMGR instead of loading Windows directly. Usually, a default choice is preselected with a time delay during which a user can press a key to change the choice; after this delay, the default choice is automatically run so normal booting can occur without interaction.

The boot process can be considered complete when the computer is ready to interact with the user, or the operating system is capable of running system programs or application programs.

Many embedded systems must boot immediately. For example, waiting a minute for a digital television or a GPS navigation device to start is generally unacceptable. Therefore, such devices have software systems in ROM or flash memory so the device can begin functioning immediately; little or no loading is necessary, because the loading can be precomputed and stored on the ROM when the device is made.

Large and complex systems may have boot procedures that proceed in multiple phases until finally the operating system and other programs are loaded and ready to execute. Because operating systems are designed as if they never start or stop, a boot loader might load the operating system, configure itself as a mere process within that system, and then irrevocably transfer control to the operating system. The boot loader then terminates normally as any other process would.

### Response:
","A two-stage bootloader actually consists of two bootloaders after each other. The first being small with the sole purpose of loading the second one. The second one can then contain all the code needed for loading the kernel. GRUB uses two (or arguably, three) stages."

Why do people visit the national parks?

### Response:
","The national parks are a system of diverse natural and historical locations that are preserved for people to enjoy. Because there is such variety in the national parks there's sure to be something that interests you. Some parks are made up of vast natural landscapes and wildernesses that can be explored. Others are sanctuaries for wildlife where you can see animals in their natural habitat. Still other locations are on islands or have amazing coastline and includes underwater habitats and wildlife. While some national parks are harder to access, most can be enjoyed by the majority of people. If you hate paying high entrance fees to destination locations the national parks are also a great option. You can get an annual pass for less than $100 which allows you to visit all national parks and many national forests and monuments at no additional charge. However, if you want to stay within the national parks make sure to book well in advance as campsites and lodging fills up quickly. For the most popular parks you'll want to book six months in advance when the reservations open up. The national parks can be enjoyed by people of all ages and have stunning vistas you can drive right up to or week long backpacking trips for adventure seekers."

How does the Stock Market work?

### Response:
","The stock market helps companies raise money to fund operations by selling shares of stock, and it creates and sustains wealth for individual investors.

Companies raise money on the stock market by selling ownership stakes to investors. These equity stakes are known as shares of stock. By listing shares for sale on the stock exchanges that make up the stock market, companies get access to the capital they need to operate and expand their businesses without having to take on debt. In exchange for the privilege of selling stock to the public, companies are required to disclose information and give shareholders a say in how their businesses are run.

Investors benefit by exchanging their money for shares on the stock market. As companies put that money to work growing and expanding their businesses, investors reap the benefits as their shares of stock become more valuable over time, leading to capital gains. In addition, companies pay dividends to their shareholders as their profits grow.

The performances of individual stocks vary widely over time, but taken as a whole the stock market has historically rewarded investors with average annual returns of around 10%, making it one of the most reliable ways of growing your money."

What is the difference between worker bees and drone bees, and are there any other types of bees?

### Response:
","Workers are the smallest of the bee castes, but are by far the most numerous. All workers are female, and normally incapable of reproduction. They are unable to mate, but in a hopelessly queenless colony, workers may begin to lay unfertilized eggs, which develop into drones. Drones are the male honey bees. The only function of a drone is to fertilize a young queen bee. Queen bee function in the hive is one of production. Queen bee is normally the only reproductive female in the colony. Egg-laying begins in early spring, initiated when the first fresh pollen is brought home by the workers. Egg production will continue until fall, or as long as pollen is available. So there are three types of bees: workers, drones and a queen bee."

Why are drill jigs less commonly used today than they were in the past?
A drill jig is a type of jig that expedites repetitive hole center location on multiple interchangeable parts by acting as a template to guide the twist drill or other boring device into the precise location of each intended hole center. In metalworking practice, typically a hardened drill bushing lines each hole on the jig plate to keep the tool from damaging the jig.

Drill jigs started falling into disuse with the invention of the jig borer.

Since the widespread penetration of the manufacturing industry by CNC machine tools, in which servo controls are capable of moving the tool to the correct location automatically, the need for drill jigs (and for the jobs of the drill press operators who used them) is much less than it used to be.

### Response:
","Because of CNC machine tooling, which automate much of the drilling process"

What was the Ghazi Attack in Indian subcontinent?
PNS/M Ghazi (S–130) (previously USS Diablo (SS-479); reporting name: Ghazi), SJ, was a Tench-class diesel-electric submarine, the first fast-attack submarine in the Pakistan Navy. She was leased from the United States Navy in 1963. 

She served in the United States Navy from 1945 to 1963 and was loaned to Pakistan under the Security Assistance Program on a four-year lease after the Ayub administration successfully negotiated with the Kennedy administration for its procurement.In 1964, she joined the Pakistan Navy and saw military action in the Indo-Pakistani theatres in the 1965 and, later in the 1971 wars.

In 1968 Ghazi executed a submerged circumnavigation of Africa and southern parts of Europe through the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean, due to the closure of the Suez Canal, in order to be refitted and updated at Gölcük, Turkey. The submarine could be armed with up to 28 Mk.14 torpedoes and had the capability of mine-laying added as part of her refit.

Starting as the only submarine in the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965, Ghazi remained the Pakistan Navy's flagship submarine until she sank under mysterious circumstances near India's eastern coast while conducting naval operations en route to the Bay of Bengal. While the Indian Navy credits Ghazi's sinking to its destroyer INS Rajput, the Pakistani military oversights and reviews stated that ""the submarine sank due to either an internal explosion or accidental detonation of mines being laid by the submarine off the Visakhapatnam harbour"".

In 2010 the Indian Navy destroyed all records of their investigations into this matter. Many believe this to be an attempt to falsify history.Nonetheless, Indian historians consider the sinking of Ghazi to be a notable event; as they have described the sinking as one of the ""last unsolved greatest mysteries of the 1971 war.""

### Response:
","Ghazi was a war submarine in the Pakistan Navy. The submarine was a flagship Submarine for Pakistan. It was loaned by the US Navy. In the 1971 war in the Indian Subcontinent, the Ghazi submarine sank due to various unknown circumstances. The Pakistan navy had deployed a number of underwater mines in the region. It may have been an attack by the Indian Navy and/or may have been one of the mines they had placed themselves. It's unclear what exactly happened, but the Indian Navy destroyed all records of their investigations in 2010."

Gangga (or Tingri according to name of region) (Tibetan: སྒང་དགའ་, Wylie: sgang dga'; Chinese: 岗嘎镇; pinyin: Gǎnggā Zhèn)[1] is a town in Tingri County, in the south of the Tibet Autonomous Region. It has a population of around 523, and is often used as a base by mountain climbers preparing to ascend Mount Everest or Cho Oyu. It is known[citation needed] for its views of Mount Everest, Mount Lhotse, Mount Makalu, and Cho Oyu, which comprise four of the six highest mountains in the world.

Tingri used to be an important trading post where Sherpas from Nepal exchanged rice, grain and iron for Tibetan wool, livestock and salt. It gives its name to the more than 4,500-meter (14,800 ft)-high broad upland basin that is known as the Tingri Plain. One must cross the pass known as the Lak Pa La (el. 5,220 meters (17,130 ft)) to the north to reach the Tsangpo Valley system. Shallow, fast-flowing rivers of melted snow water make its grassy meadowland ideal for grazing by Tibetan animals. The plain used to abound with gazelles, blue sheep, antelopes and khyang or wild asses but most of the animals are gone now.[2] The Chinese army has a small base nearby.

Tingri Lankor (Ding ri glang 'khor) — Padampa's Residence was founded in 1097 CE by the South Indian Buddhist adept, Padampa Sangye (died 1117) who made five visits to Tibet and was an important person in the re-establishment of the Buddhadharma in Tibet. His consort was the Tibetan dakini Machik Labdron. The gompa or temple was built in the Padampa Sange's meditation cave and became the seat of the Dampapa School of Tibetan Buddhism. It is in the process of restoration.[3]

### Response:
","Tingri was used as a trading post by Sherpas from Nepal as a means for exchanging rice, grain and iron in return for Tibetan wool, livestock and salt."

### Instruction:
Why do eucalyptus trees have such an excellent aroma?  Is there any other uses for Eucalyptus?
Some Eucalyptus species have attracted attention from horticulturists, global development researchers, and environmentalists because of desirable traits such as being fast-growing sources of wood, producing oil that can be used for cleaning and as a natural insecticide, or an ability to be used to drain swamps and thereby reduce the risk of malaria. Eucalyptus oil finds many uses like in fuels, fragrances, insect repellence and antimicrobial activity. Eucalyptus trees show allelopathic effects; they release compounds which inhibit other plant species from growing nearby. Outside their natural ranges, eucalypts are both lauded for their beneficial economic impact on poor populations[50][49]: 22  and criticised for being ""water-guzzling"" aliens,[51] leading to controversy over their total impact.[34]

### Response:
",The oil from Eucalyptus trees provides several benefits with the most prevalent being the pleasant aroma.  As a tree that grows fast and has been used strategically to reduce the risk of malaria by draining swamps a little Eucalyptus goes a long way.  The oil produced by these trees are also useful in an antimicrobial activity and in some cases has been known to make the trees more flammable.  Outside of their native Australia they have been viewed as an invasive species.

### Response:
","Most ski resorts have excellent beginner areas (often called bunny hills), which are labeled as ""green runs"". These areas are also where beginner ski lessons are taught. In some cases, though, beginners prefer to go to smaller or less expensive ski resorts as they are not able to take advantage of the more difficult terrain on a larger mountain. In that case, a smaller, cheaper ski resort might be better for a beginner; these tend to be located on smaller mountains and can often be more convenient to nearby cities and towns, although the snow quality and number of ski runs is often significantly less."

Write a brief paragraph about the evolution of Egyptian pyramids.

### Response:
","Egyptian pyramids are fascinating ancient buildings edified more than 2500 years before the Common Era. According to Egyptologists, these megalithic structures served as tombs for the biggest pharaohs that successively ruled the region in that Era. The biggest ones, present until now in Giza, are built with astonishing precision using the rudimental tools and materials that were available at that time. For example, Khufu pyramid, culminating at 481 feet, is an architectural masterpiece. The size, orientation and precision of this pyramid are keeping the best current architects agape. However, the journey was not straightforward for ancient Egyptians. Building such megalithic structures remains very hard to even nowadays. Before achieving the precision of the pyramids on Giza plateau, some inconsistencies and simpler trials are still present in Egypt showing the progressive improvement in their construction know-how through time. The first historically documented pyramid in Egypt is attributed to Djozer pharaoh in the third dynastic period. It is a stepped structure with superposed squares without big attention to the external design and polishment that we find later in the more recent pyramids. Egyptologists proved the existence of many other attempts to build similar structures in the same dynasty. However, the first complete pyramid structures appeared only in the 4th dynasty, giving successively the rise of the great pyramids of Meidum, Dahshur, and Giza"

What is Spatial Analysis?

### Response:
","Spatial analysis is any of the formal techniques which studies entities using their topological, geometric, or geographic properties. Spatial analysis includes a variety of techniques using different analytic approaches, especially spatial statistics. In may be applied in fields as diverse as astronomy, with its studies of the placement of galaxies in the cosmos, or to chip fabrication engineering, with its use of ""place and route"" algorithms to build complex wiring structures. In a more restricted sense, spatial analysis is geospatial analysis, the technique applied to structures at the human scale, most notably in the analysis of geographic data. It may also be applied to genomics, as in transcriptomics data.

Complex issues arise in spatial analysis, many of which are neither clearly defined nor completely resolved, but form the basis for current research. The most fundamental of these is the problem of defining the spatial location of the entities being studied. Classification of the techniques of spatial analysis is difficult because of the large number of different fields of research involved, the different fundamental approaches which can be chosen, and the many forms the data can take."

What is beta oxidation?

### Response:
","In biochemistry and metabolism, beta oxidation (also β-oxidation) is the catabolic process by which fatty acid molecules are broken down[1] in the cytosol in prokaryotes and in the mitochondria in eukaryotes to generate acetyl-CoA, which enters the citric acid cycle, and NADH and FADH2, which are co-enzymes used in the electron transport chain. It is named as such because the beta carbon of the fatty acid undergoes oxidation to a carbonyl group. Beta-oxidation is primarily facilitated by the mitochondrial trifunctional protein, an enzyme complex associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane, although very long chain fatty acids are oxidized in peroxisomes."

Based on the following passage when do schools close and resume after summer holidays in the United States?
Schools and universities typically have a summer break to take advantage of the warmer weather and longer days. In almost all countries, children are out of school during this time of year for summer break, although dates vary. Many families will take holidays for a week or two over summer, particularly in Southern Hemisphere Western countries with statutory Christmas and New Year holidays.
In the United States, public schools usually end in late May in Memorial Day weekend, while colleges finish in early May. Public school traditionally resumes near Labor Day, while higher institutions often resume in mid-August.
In England and Wales, school ends in mid-July and resumes again in early September. In Scotland, the summer holiday begins in late June and ends in mid-to late-August. Similarly, in Canada the summer holiday starts on the last or second-last Friday in June and ends in late August or on the first Tuesday of September, with the exception of when that date falls before Labour Day, in which case, ends on the second Tuesday of the month. In Russia the summer holiday begins at the end of May and ends on 31 August.
In the Southern Hemisphere, school summer holiday dates include the major holidays of Christmas and New Year's Day. School summer holidays in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa begin in early December and end in early February, with dates varying between states. In South Africa, the new school year usually starts during the second week of January, thus aligning the academic year with the Calendar year. In India, school ends in late April and resumes in early or mid-June. In Cameroon and Nigeria, schools usually finish for summer vacation in mid-July and resume in the later weeks of September or the first week of October.

Why do we have a threefold repetition rule in chess?
In chess, the threefold repetition rule states that a player may claim a draw if the same position occurs three times during the game. The rule is also known as repetition of position and, in the USCF rules, as triple occurrence of position.[1] Two positions are by definition ""the same"" if the same types of pieces occupy the same squares, the same player has the move, the remaining castling rights are the same and the possibility to capture en passant is the same. The repeated positions need not occur in succession. The reasoning behind the rule is that if the position occurs three times, no real progress is being made and the game could hypothetically continue indefinitely.

The game is not automatically drawn if a position occurs for the third time – one of the players, on their turn, must claim the draw with the arbiter. The claim must be made either before making the move which will produce the third repetition, or after the opponent has made a move producing a third repetition. By contrast, the fivefold repetition rule requires the arbiter to intervene and declare the game drawn if the same position occurs five times, needing no claim by the players.

### Response:
",This rule is to ensure the game ends and does not continue indefinitely.

What is the oldest known civilization?
Scholars generally acknowledge six cradles of civilization. Mesopotamia, Ancient Egypt, Indus Valley, and Ancient China are believed to be the earliest in the Old World.[1][2] Cradles of civilization in the New World are the Caral-Supe civilization of coastal Peru and the Olmec civilization of Mexico. All of the cradles of civilization depended upon agriculture for sustenance (except possibly Caral-Supe which may have depended initially on marine resources). All depended upon farmers producing an agricultural surplus to support the centralized government, political leaders, priests, and public works of the urban centers of the civilization.

Less formally, the term ""cradle of civilization"" is often used to refer to other historic ancient civilizations, such as Greece or Rome, which have both been called the ""cradle of Western civilization"".

What is the highest-grossing film worldwide?
With a worldwide box-office gross of over $2.9 billion, Avatar is proclaimed to be the ""highest-grossing"" film, but such claims usually refer to theatrical revenues only and do not take into account home video and television income, which can form a significant portion of a film's earnings. Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful. Titanic earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals,[1] in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theatres. While complete sales data are not available for Avatar, it earned $345 million from the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu-ray units in North America,[2] and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu-ray units worldwide.[3] After home video income is accounted for, both films have earned over $3 billion each. Television broadcast rights will also substantially add to a film's earnings, with a film often earning as much as 20–25% of its theatrical box office for a couple of television runs on top of pay-per-view revenues;[4] Titanic earned a further $55 million from the NBC and HBO broadcast rights,[1] equating to about 9% of its North American gross.

### Response:
","Avatar is the highest-grossing film worldwide, grossing over $2.9B. It was written and directed by James Cameron, and was released in 2009."

List all the singles Jimmy Cozier has.
Jimmy Cozier (born February 6, 1977)[1][2] is an American R&B singer and songwriter. He is best known for his hit single ""She's All I Got"" and for being one of the inaugural artists signed to Clive Davis' J Records label.

Biography
The son of Guyanese American jazz saxophonist Jimmy Cozier, and Dawn Cozier, a Jamaican born hair stylist. Cozier and his younger brother Malik were raised in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Cozier was encouraged to sing as a child by his family, who would demand that he perform in group settings. He started out as a singer/songwriter for artists such as Mýa, Sinéad O'Connor, and Janet Jackson (whose hit ""Girlfriend/Boyfriend"" he co-wrote). He was a background vocalist for the Junior Mafia/Lil' Kim track ""Backstabbers"" and toured with Joe behind the latter's album All That I Am.

Wyclef Jean caught word of Cozier's talent thru Cozier manager Jacques “Haitian Jack” Agnant and had him meet with Clive Davis, who signed Cozier to J Records in 2000. His debut single ""She's All I Got"" was released in 2001, and rose to #26 on the Billboard Hot 100 and to #4 on the R&B chart.[3]

Following the success of the single, his self-titled debut album was released on July 9, 2001 and hit the Billboard Top 200 at #65 and #15 on the R&B Albums chart.[4] A follow-up single ""So Much to Lose"" was released later in the year, and peaked at #123 on the R&B chart. He also appeared on labelmate Alicia Keys' debut Songs in A Minor on the track ""Mr. Man"" which he co-wrote, and ""Turn Around"" with other labelmate Olivia, on her self-titled debut album.

He began writing songs for other artists such as Chris Brown, Olivia and Cheri Dennis in the years since. After the folding of J Records, he became an independent artist, creating his own label, Cozi Music Inc.

In 2007, he announced work on a new album, releasing two singles, ""U Got Them Goods"" and ""You"", that year. Continued work on his sophomore album stretched through 2010.

His second album, Way of Life was announced in 2010, led by the single ""Tonight"" which was released on March 2, 2010. The album was released on March 16, 2010.

In 2013, he collaborated with Sean Paul for his single ""Always Be My Lady"" which was released on August 2. Additionally, he released a single ""Girls Girls"" that year.

The next year, he premiered a new single ""Choose Me"" featuring Shaggy[5][6] and announced his third album would be titled R&B (Reggae & Blues)[7] set for a 2015 release. Following the single, he collaborated with artists such as Gyptian, Elephant Man, Shaggy, Red Fox, Melissa Musique on various compilation albums. One of those collaborations, ""Special Girl (Remix)"" was released as a single in 2014.

His third album, titled Get Cozi was released on December 9, 2016. The set's second single ""I'll Change"" was announced that same month.[8]

Who were supporters of Quit India movement?
The Quit India Movement, also known as the Bharat Chhodo Andolan, was a movement launched at the Bombay session of the All India Congress Committee by Mahatma Gandhi on 8th August 1942, during World War II, demanding an end to British rule in India.

After the British failed to secure Indian support for the British war effort with Cripps Mission, Gandhi made a call to Do or Die in his Quit India movement delivered in Bombay on 8 August 1942 at the Gowalia Tank Maidan.[5] Viceroy Linlithgow remarked the movement to be ""by far the most serious rebellion since 1857"".[6][7]

The All India Congress Committee launched a mass protest demanding what Gandhi called ""An Orderly British Withdrawal"" from India. Even though it was at war, the British were prepared to act. Almost the entire leadership of the Indian National Congress was imprisoned without trial within hours of Gandhi's speech. Most spent the rest of the war in prison and out of contact with the masses. The British had the support of the Viceroy's Council, of the All India Muslim League, the Hindu Mahasabha, the princely states, the Indian Imperial Police, the British Indian Army, and the Indian Civil Service. Many Indian businessmen profiting from heavy wartime spending did not support the Quit India Movement. The major outside support came from the Americans, as President Franklin D. Roosevelt pressured Prime Minister Winston Churchill to give in to some of the Indian demands.[8]

Various violent incidents took place around the country against the British regime. The British arrested tens of thousands of leaders, keeping them imprisoned until 1945. Ultimately, the British government realised that India was ungovernable in the long run, and the question for the postwar era became how to exit gracefully and peacefully.

Who owns ITV?
The history of ITV, the United Kingdom ""Independent Television"" commercial network, goes back to 1955.[1]

Independent Television began as a network of independently-owned regional companies that were both broadcasters and programme makers, beginning with four companies operating six stations in three large regions in 1955–1956, and gradually expanding to 17 stations in 14 regions by 1962. Each regional station was responsible for its own branding, scheduling and advertising, with many peak-time programmes shared simultaneously across the whole network.

By 29 February 2016, 12 regions in England and Wales shared national ITV branding and scheduling, and, together with a 13th region UTV in Northern Ireland, were owned by a single company, ITV plc. A further two regions in Scotland carry STV branding and are owned by the STV Group.

### Response:
",ITV plc owns all 13 ITV regions in England and Wales as well as UTV in Northern Ireland. STV Group owns the STV region in Scotland.

What are the main points in this article
Today, Finland became the 31st member of NATO, ending its decades-long policy of neutrality. Foreign minister Pekka Haavisto handed over the official documents in Brussels to United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

Map of NATO members including Finland
The accession was marked by raising the Finnish flag at NATO's main office in Brussels, Belgium, while the NATO flag was raised in Helsinki.

Finland shares a 1,340 kilometers (833 mi)-long border with Russia. By joining NATO, it roughly doubled the length of NATO borders with Russia.

""Until now, we have defended our country alone,"" said Defense Minister Antti Kaikkonen. ""From now on, we can rely on getting outside help should things get tough. And of course, we are ready to help should someone be in trouble.""

Kremlin representative Dmitry Peskov said it was an ""encroachment on our security and on Russia's national interests"". He said Russia would closely monitor NATO activity in Finland and take ""counter-measures"".

""Finland's membership is not targeted against anyone. Nor does it change the foundations or objectives of Finland's foreign and security policy,"" read a statement by Finnish President Sauli Niinistö after the accession documents were transferred.

""President Putin had as a declared goal of the invasion of Ukraine to get less NATO. He is getting exactly the opposite,"" said NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. ""Finland today, and soon also Sweden will become a full-fledged member of the alliance"".

In the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year, public sentiment in Finland and Sweden, which were both non-aligned countries, shifted drastically, to 80% support in the former's case. On May 18, both nations submitted applications to join NATO. New members must have the support of all existing members before they can join.

The applications were held up by Turkey under Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, because Finland and Sweden have granted political asylum to members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which Turkey views as a terrorist organization. Last week, the Grand National Assembly of Turkey voted to approve Finland.

Sweden still has to obtain the approval of both Hungary and Turkey before it can join. Hungary objects to Sweden based on its criticism of Viktor Orbán's government. A far-right group in Sweden held a Quran-burning in front of the Turkish embassy in January, which was condemned by the Turkish government.

After Russia won the Finnish War over Sweden in 1809, Finland became a Grand Duchy of the tsarist Russian Empire. This lasted until the Russian Civil War started in 1917 and Finland declared its independence.

In 1939, the Soviet Union invaded Finland in a conflict called the Winter War. It ended with a treaty in 1940, under which Finland ceded territory to the Soviets. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 during World War II, Finland entered the war on the side of Germany. It ended with an armistice in 1944, and Finland relinquished another province.

Under President Urho Kekkonen, Finland formally adopted a policy of neutrality in 1956.

You are a young citizen of a developing country. Write a letter in less than 150 words to a newspaper, highlighting your concern over incorrect disposal of biomedical waste and to spread awareness of the same.

### Response:
","The Covid19 pandemic has changed the lives of all human beings, and has driven massive consumption of personal protective equipment worldwide. People have adapted to wearing face masks as a 'new normal'. At the same time, the disposal of biomedical waste is a major concern, especially in developing countries with limited resources. Biomedical waste includes used Rapid Antigen Tests, PCR Tests, used injections, and used masks. We have observed that people who use the test kits and masks at home, often fail to dispose them off properly. This is counter productive, as it poses the risk of aiding the virus' transmission, and can potentially be life threatening to others. Hospitals, too, produce a huge amount of waste and it is imperative they dispose it off properly following all norms. 

If not scientifically handled and disposed, it could cause serious risk not just to human health, but also pose a serious threat to terrestrial and marine ecosystems.

Thank you for highlighting my concerns to your readership, and I request you to keep highlighting these concerns to your audience regularly via your articles."

Provide a bulleted list of the different shapes of lenses
Construction of Simple Lenses

Most lenses are spherical lenses: their two surfaces are parts of the surfaces of spheres. Each surface can be convex (bulging outwards from the lens), concave (depressed into the lens), or planar (flat). The line joining the centres of the spheres making up the lens surfaces is called the axis of the lens. Typically the lens axis passes through the physical centre of the lens, because of the way they are manufactured. Lenses may be cut or ground after manufacturing to give them a different shape or size. The lens axis may then not pass through the physical centre of the lens.

Toric or sphero-cylindrical lenses have surfaces with two different radii of curvature in two orthogonal planes. They have a different focal power in different meridians. This forms an astigmatic lens. An example is eyeglass lenses that are used to correct astigmatism in someone's eye.

### Response:
","The following are the different shapes of lenses:
- Convex: Curves out from the middle of the lens

Given this paragraph about blockchain, how did blockchain influence bitcoin cryptocurrency?
Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network for use as a public distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance. A blockchain was created by a person (or group of people) using the name (or pseudonym) Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public distributed ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions, based on previous work by Stuart Haber, W. Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer. The implementation of the blockchain within bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications and blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely used by cryptocurrencies. The blockchain may be considered a type of payment rail.

### Response:
","Blockchain is the technology that enables the existence of cryptocurrency and bitcoin is the name of the best-known cryptocurrency. The implementation of bitcoin using blockchain made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server. Bitcoin has inspired other applications and blockchains that are highly available, public, and are widely used by cryptocurrencies."

Are there more wheels or doors in New York City?

### Response:
","This has been a long-term debate. I think there are more wheels than doors in New York City. Here is why. Many people who argue there are more doors bring up office doors, car doors (cars also have 4 wheels), cabinets, refrigerators, etc. However, I think what sets the number of wheels apart from doors is office chairs. Each office chair has four wheels and zero doors. Now multiply the number of workers in New York by four and that will get you the number of additional wheels - which I think offsets the number of doors that exist in the city."

What is the Monty Hall problem?

### Response:
","The Monty Hall problem is a probability brain teaser that many consider to be counterintuitive. The problem is stated as follows: Imagine you are a contestant on a game show and the host shows you 3 doors. Behind one of the doors is a car and behind the other two are goats. The prizes have been randomly assigned to the doors and you want to win the car. The host allows you to pick one of the doors as a first selection. Then, the host opens one of the remaining doors and reveals a goat is behind it. The host now allows you to decide if you want to switch from your selected door to the remaining unopened door. Should you switch, to maximize your probability of winning the car?

Most people believe switching does not improve your probability of winning the car. However switching does increase your probability of winning the car from 1/3 to 2/3. An intuitive way to understand this problem is by first considering the initial state. At your first selection the probability that you have selected the right door is 1/3 and the probability that the car remains behind one of the two unselected doors is 2/3. Then the host reveals more information. The host reveals that one of the unselected doors does not have the car behind it. The probability that the originally unselected doors must have the car behind one of them is still 2/3, but you now know one of them specifically which does not have the car. Therefore, the remaining unopened unselected door must have a probability of 2/3 to contain the car, and your originally selected door must have a probability of 1/3. When offered the chance, you should switch to maximize your chances of winning the car."

Never will we sit and chat as we once used to."

Wat id DNA annotation?

### Response:
","DNA annotation or genome annotation is the process of identifying the locations of genes and all of the coding regions in a genome and determining what those genes do. An annotation (irrespective of the context) is a note added by way of explanation or commentary. Once a genome is sequenced, it needs to be annotated to make sense of it. Genes in a eukaryotic genome can be annotated using various annotation tools such as FINDER. A modern annotation pipeline can support a user-friendly web interface and software containerization such as MOSGA. Modern annotation pipelines for prokaryotic genomes are Bakta, Prokka and PGAP.

For DNA annotation, a previously unknown sequence representation of genetic material is enriched with information relating genomic position to intron-exon boundaries, regulatory sequences, repeats, gene names and protein products. This annotation is stored in genomic databases such as Mouse Genome Informatics, FlyBase, and WormBase. Educational materials on some aspects of biological annotation from the 2006 Gene Ontology annotation camp and similar events are available at the Gene Ontology website.

The National Center for Biomedical Ontology develops tools for automated annotation of database records based on the textual descriptions of those records.

As a general method, dcGO has an automated procedure for statistically inferring associations between ontology terms and protein domains or combinations of domains from the existing gene/protein-level annotations."

Give me a one line summary of the story below: 

A long long time ago the Queen of Odisha heard that there was a master stone sculptor who made such stunning statues of the gods that people would weep from happiness at the beauty of the statues if they saw them. One summer day, while resting indolently with the King in the main hall of the royal palace, the Queen suddenly had a thought. ""How nice it would be, King, if we could build some beautiful statutes of Lord Jagannath so that the people can come worship Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subadhra. What do you think?"" 

The King thought for a few minutes, and then nodded in agreement. ""What do you have in mind, my Queen?"" And so, soon the stone sculptor was summoned to appear before the Court for an appointment to build in his way the statutes of the gods. Soon the monsoon season started and the sculptor appeared in front of the court, awaiting his appointment. He was a humble man from the mountainous regions of Odisha. Even at his best-dressed, one couldn't help but notice his rough hands, and the small sprinkling of dust that seemed ever present in his hair. 

The King and Queen graciously waited as the sculptor bowed and then asked ""Your majesties, what can I do for you?"" The Queen leaned forward in her throne and her voice rang out in the court ""We have heard, o Master Sculptor, of your skills from people far and wide across the Kingdom. We dream of having you put your skills to use to build beautiful statues that will represent Lord Jagannath, Subhadra, and Balabhadra for our people to worship.""

The sculptor was silent. As his silence extended, ministers of the court began to feel restless. ""Speak up! How can you be silent when the Queen graces you so!"" But still, the sculptor was silent. 

The King and Queen sat patiently in their thrones as they waited for the sculptor to respond. Perhaps the enormity of the task was too much. Perhaps, the sculptor was thinking of what he should ask for in return. Or even more, perhaps, the sculptor was awed and honored by the request. 

At last, as the shadows from the late afternoon sun began to stretch across the floors of the hall, the sculptor shifted his weight, and opened his mouth to speak. ""Your majesties, you grace me with such a request, I cannot help but oblige. It is an honor."" At this, the Queen sat as straight as a rod, listening for the words that would come next. ""But, I can do this on one condition only. I will work in a closed hall, where none may enter - regardless of whether they can hear me working or otherwise. None may enter until I open the doors from within and proclaim to all that the statues are completed.""

The ministers gasped - what a strange request from this man. Was he a fool? What if he just slept and ate and didn't do any work? How could the King and Queen trust that he would do the work he was promising to do? The Queen looked on thoughtfully. She glanced at the King, and it seemed to her that he agreed on this condition without reservation. She looked at the sculptor and then nodded her assent. ""We decree that you shall build these statues in a hall set aside, into which no one shall enter until your work is complete and you proclaim that to us after opening the doors of the hall from within.""

### Response:
","A master sculptor in Odisha is hired by the King & Queen to build statutes of Lord Jagannath, Subhadra, and Balabhadra, on the condition that no one will disturb the master sculptor from his work, until he himself announces that his work is complete."

### Response:
","In basketball, when a team has the ball, one person may set a screen by blocking a defender with his body but making sure his hands are not extended. This allows the person with the ball to pass, shoot, etc. without issuing any fouls. If the person setting a screen moves while screening, the referee will call a moving screen and the ball will be inbounded by the person who moved while screening from the half court line. In any case, screens do not foul the screener for contact unless they are to do physical contact with their hands or feet."

### Instruction:
Write me a recursive function for calculating the nth fibonacci number

### Response:
","Below is a recursive Python function fib(n) that computes the nth Fibonacci number. This is split into a base case and a recursive case. The base case is given by the fact that the first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, so fib(0)=0 and fib(1)=1. The recursive case is given by the fact that the nth Fibonacci number f_n can be written as the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers, so f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}. Putting this all together, we get

```
def fib(n):
	# base case
	if n == 0:
		return 0
	if n == 1:
		return 1

	# recursive case
	return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
```

This will correctly calculate the nth Fibonacci number for nonnegative integer inputs n. However, recursively calculating Fibonacci numbers in this way takes exponential time in the value of n, so this code may be very slow for large inputs. It could be improved by memoizing previous results, or using a non-recursive approach. Simple iterative approaches can solve the problem more quickly, and closed-form expressions for the nth Fibonacci number exist and are even faster to evaluate."

Where is the Black Strait Lake
The Garabogazköl (also spelt Kara-Bogaz-Gol; ""Black Strait Lake""), or Garabogazköl Aylagy (""Black Strait Lake Bay""), is a shallow, water-filled, highly-saline depression in the northwestern corner of Turkmenistan.[1] It forms a lagoon of the Caspian Sea and has a variable surface area, about 18,000 km2 (6,900 sq mi).[2] The Caspian Sea proper sits immediately to the west, mostly divorced by a narrow, rocky ridge having a very narrow opening through which the Caspian waters flow, overwhelmingly, into it. There is likely to be a subterranean highly saline flow, only when there is less evaporation in winter, as in the case of the Turkish Straits year-round. The lagoon's volume fluctuates seasonally, accentuated by its salt evaporation ponds and natural counterpart surrounding, seasonally dry salt pans.

The city of Garabogaz (formerly Bekdaş) lies on the ridge, about 50 km (31 mi) north of the channel between the main Caspian basin and the Garabogazköl lagoon. It has a population of about 10,000 people.

### Response:
","You can fry and egg on a stovetop. Its recommended to preheat the pan on medium heat, once warm spray the pan with cooking spray or use butter before cracking an egg into the pan. Cook for a few minutes before flipping to fully cook the egg.  This method is most common when preparing an egg sandwich such as a bacon egg and cheese, or a sausage egg and cheese. You can also scramble eggs in a pot or pan. To do this you whisk a few eggs in a bowl with some milk, could be any kind of milk like skim milk or a dairy free milk like almond milk. Preheat the stove to medium heat and warm the pot or pan while you do this. Then pour the eggs into the pan and continually stir the eggs, scraping the bottom of the pan to ensure the eggs are fluffy. You can also poach an egg by cracking an egg into boiling water. Lastly, you can make a hardboiled egg by putting a desired number of eggs in a pot of water before placing on the stove. Once on the stove bring to a boil for 7-8 minutes."

Which of the 10 largest earthquakes was the deadliest?
Largest Earthquakes ever recorded
The 10 largest magnitudes in recorded history
1. Valdivia, Chile 22 May 1960 (magnitude 9.5)
This earthquake killed 1655 people, injured 3000 and displaced two million. It caused US$550 million damage in Chile, while the tsunami that it spawned caused deaths and damage as far away as Hawaii, Japan and the Philippines. The 'rupture zone' of the quake was more than 1000 km long. Two days after the initial quake, the nearby volcano Puyehue erupted, sending ash and steam up to 6 km into the atmosphere over a period of several weeks.

2. Prince William Sound, Alaska 28 March 1964 (magnitude 9.2)
Compared to the Chilean earthquake, this earthquake was less damaging: the resulting tsunami took 128 lives and caused overall US$311 million in damage. The earthquake was felt mainly over Alaska, as well as some places in Canada, while the tsunami created by it caused damage as far away as Hawaii. The most damage was sustained by the city of Anchorage, 120 km north-west of the epicentre. Shaking from the quake itself is reported to have lasted for three minutes.

3. Sumatra, Indonesia 26 December 2004 (magnitude 9.1)
In terms of damage and loss of life, the scale of the disaster caused by the resulting Boxing Day Tsunami was enormous. In total, 227,900 people were killed or presumed dead, with around 1.7 million displaced over 14 countries in South Asia and East Africa. The epicentre was 250 km south-east of Band Aceh, Indonesia, at a depth of 30 km. Several days later on 28 December, a mud volcano began erupting near Baratang, Andamar Islands, which is thought to have been associated with the earthquake.

4. Sendai, Japan 11 March 2011 (magnitude 9.0)
So far the official death toll stands at several thousand from the combined effect of the powerful earthquake, aftershocks and the tsunami. However, the total is expected to rise, with some estimates of a final toll of over 10,000. Economic impacts are expected to be huge, with the shutting down of nuclear reactors which many industries rely on for power.

5. Kamchatka, Russia 4 November 1952 (magnitude 9.0)
This earthquake generated a tsunami that caused widespread damage in the Hawaiian Islands. Property damage was estimated at around US$1,000,000. Some reports describe waves of over 9 m high at Kaena Point, Oahu. A farmer on Oahu reported the loss of six cows to the tsunami, but no people were reported killed.

6. Bio-bio, Chile 27 February 2010 (magnitude 8.8)
This earthquake and subsequent tsunami killed at least 521 people, with 56 missing and 12,000 injured. More than 800,000 people were displaced with a total of 1.8m people affected across Chile, where damage was estimated at US$30 billion. The epicentre was 335 km south-west of Santiago, at a depth of 35 km. A minor tsunami travelled across the Pacific causing damage to boats as far away as San Diego, California.

7. Off the coast of Ecuador 31 January 1906 (magnitude 8.8)
This earthquake caused a tsunami that is reported to have killed between 500 and 1,500 in Ecuador and Colombia. The tsunami travelled as far north as San Francisco, on the west coast of the US, and west to Hawaii and Japan. The tsunami took roughly 12 hours to cross the Pacific to Hilo, Hawaii.

8. Rat Islands, Alaska 2 April 1965 (magnitude 8.7)
The worst of the damage attributed to this earthquake was caused by a tsunami, reported to be about 10 m high on Shemya Island. The wave caused flooding on Amchitka Island, causing US$10,000 in property damage. No deaths or injuries were reported.

9. Sumatra, Indonesia 28 March 2005 (magnitude 8.6)
This earthquake killed 1313, with over 400 people injured by the tsunami as far away as Sri Lanka. The epicentre was 205 km north-west of Sibolga, Sumatra, at a depth of 30 km. This region, also the site of the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami, is particularly geologically active, with three of the 15 biggest known earthquakes having happened here.

10. Assam - Tibet 15 August 1950 (magnitude 8.6)
This inland earthquake caused widespread damages to buildings as well as large landslides. 780 people were killed in eastern Tibet, with many villages and towns affected across Assam, China, Tibet and India. Oscillations to lake levels occurred as far away as Norway. The total death toll is likely to be higher, as no definitive total was ever estimated. While the earthquake itself is known as the Assam Earthquake, it is believed the epicentre may have been in Tibet.

What is the most known picture from Dorothea Lange
Resettlement Administration

Lange's iconic 1936 photograph of Florence Owens Thompson, Migrant Mother

""Broke, baby sick, and car trouble!"" (1937)
Lange and Dixon divorced on October 28, 1935 and on December 6 she married economist Paul Schuster Taylor, professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley.[13] For the next five years they traveled through the California coast and the midwest.[8] Throughout their travels they documented rural poverty, in particular the exploitation of sharecroppers and migrant laborers. Taylor interviewed subjects and gathered economic data while Lange produced photographs and accompanying data. They lived and worked from Berkeley for the rest of her life.

Working for the Resettlement Administration and Farm Security Administration, Lange's images brought to public attention the plight of the poor and forgotten—particularly sharecroppers, displaced farm families, and migrant workers. Lange's work was distributed to newspapers across the country, and the poignant images became icons of the era.

One of Lange's most recognized works is Migrant Mother, published in 1936.[17] The woman in the photograph is Florence Owens Thompson. In 1960, Lange spoke about her experience taking the photograph:

""I saw and approached the hungry and desperate mother, as if drawn by a magnet. I do not remember how I explained my presence or my camera to her, but I do remember she asked me no questions. I made five exposures, working closer and closer from the same direction. I did not ask her name or her history. She told me her age, that she was thirty-two. She said that they had been living on frozen vegetables from the surrounding fields, and birds that the children killed. She had just sold the tires from her car to buy food. There she sat in that lean-to tent with her children huddled around her, and seemed to know that my pictures might help her, and so she helped me. There was a sort of equality about it.""[18]

Lange reported the conditions at the camp to the editor of a San Francisco newspaper, showing him her photographs. The editor informed federal authorities and published an article that included some of the images. In response, the government rushed aid to the camp to prevent starvation.[19]

According to Thompson's son, while Lange got some details of the story wrong, the impact of the photograph came from an image that projected both the strengths and needs of migrant workers.[20] Twenty-two of Lange's photographs produced for the FSA were included in John Steinbeck's The Harvest Gypsies when it was first published in 1936 in The San Francisco News. According to an essay by photographer Martha Rosler, Migrant Mother became the most reproduced photograph in the world.[21]

### Response:
","The most famous picture taken by Dorothea Lange is the ""migrant mother"" where a women is shown with her child during the great depression. The image symbolises the suffering of the american population at the time following years of bad crop that led to the economic crisis of 1929 and mid 30's depression."

What are some examples of diseconomies of scale?
In microeconomics, economies of scale are the cost advantages that enterprises obtain due to their scale of operation, and are typically measured by the amount of output produced per unit of time. A decrease in cost per unit of output enables an increase in scale. At the basis of economies of scale, there may be technical, statistical, organizational or related factors to the degree of market control. This is just a partial description of the concept.

Economies of scale apply to a variety of the organizational and business situations and at various levels, such as a production, plant or an entire enterprise. When average costs start falling as output increases, then economies of scale occur. Some economies of scale, such as capital cost of manufacturing facilities and friction loss of transportation and industrial equipment, have a physical or engineering basis.

The economic concept dates back to Adam Smith and the idea of obtaining larger production returns through the use of division of labor. Diseconomies of scale are the opposite.

Economies of scale often have limits, such as passing the optimum design point where costs per additional unit begin to increase. Common limits include exceeding the nearby raw material supply, such as wood in the lumber, pulp and paper industry. A common limit for a low cost per unit weight commodities is saturating the regional market, thus having to ship product uneconomic distances. Other limits include using energy less efficiently or having a higher defect rate.

Large producers are usually efficient at long runs of a product grade (a commodity) and find it costly to switch grades frequently. They will, therefore, avoid specialty grades even though they have higher margins. Often smaller (usually older) manufacturing facilities remain viable by changing from commodity-grade production to specialty products.

Economies of scale must be distinguished from economies stemming from an increase in the production of a given plant. When a plant is used below its optimal production capacity, increases in its degree of utilization bring about decreases in the total average cost of production. As noticed, among the others, by Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen (1966) and Nicholas Kaldor (1972) these economies are not economies of scale.

### Response:
","Examples of diseconomies of scale include: using energy less efficiently, over-saturating a regional market, exceeding the local raw material supply, higher production switching costs leading to inability to pivot to higher margin products (reduced agility), and having a higher defect rate."

Can artificial intelligence and large language models replace software engineers?

### Response:
","While it is unlikely that artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) while replace high performing software engineers in the near future, there is certainly an argument that these technologies could make engineers much more productive. This in turn could reduce the need and therefore replace lower level software engineering positions. These kinds of cultural and organizational changes will likely take time. Another important dynamic to consider is that generative AI technology could significantly lower the barrier to entry for these positions while also driving the need for newer kinds of roles based on the use of this technology platform."

What is the difference in the US between a stop sign and a traffic light?

### Response:
","A stop sign is a red, eight-sided metal sign that requires a driver to stop and then proceed when it is safe to do so. Many intersections have either two or four stop signs. When more than one car arrives at the intersection, the car that arrived first has the right of way. If more than one car arrives at the same time, then the car to the right has the right of way. An electric traffic light typically has three different signals: red indicates drivers should stop until the light changes; a yellow light indicates that the driver should stop if it is safe to do so because the signal is changing from red to green; and a green light means that drivers may proceed through the intersection without stopping."

Compare middle eastern music and western music

### Response:
","If you have only listened to Western music, the first time you hear o a middle eastern melody it may sound very different and odd. Melodies in middle eastern music are generally long, lack harmony, and have unfamiliar pitches.

Middle Eastern music typically sounds monophonic, meaning it's solely based on one or more instruments that play a single melody with a different variation. Western music typically sounds polyphonic, meaning more than one layer of melody is being played simultaneously.

Western music has twelve notes per octave including seven whole notes and five half-notes. However middle eastern music is based on different scale systems. It has quarter notes in addition and various regions have a different number of notes in their octave system.

Western music has harmony (ie. chords) while middle eastern music does not. In middle eastern music, there is only one melodic line with rise and fall. So the purity of the melodic line and the complexity of the rhythm is what make two different songs apart. In contrast, western music has a structure with a beginning, middle, and end."

What is Pinot Grigio?
Pinot Gris, Pinot Grigio (US: /ˈpiːnoʊ ˈɡriːdʒioʊ, -dʒoʊ/, UK: /ˈɡrɪdʒioʊ/) or Grauburgunder is a white wine grape variety of the species Vitis vinifera. Thought to be a mutant clone of the Pinot Noir variety, it normally has a grayish-blue fruit, accounting for its name, but the grapes can have a brownish pink to black and even white appearance. The word pinot could have been given to it because the grapes grow in small pinecone-shaped clusters. The wines produced from this grape also vary in color from a deep golden yellow to copper and even a light shade of pink,[1] and it is one of the more popular grapes for skin-contact wine.

Pinot Gris is grown around the globe, with the ""spicy"" full-bodied Alsatian and lighter-bodied, more acidic Italian styles being most widely recognized. The Alsatian style, often duplicated in New World wine regions such as Marlborough, Tasmania, South Australia, Washington, Oregon, and South Africa tend to have moderate to low acidity, higher alcohol levels and an almost ""oily"" texture that contributes to the full-bodied nature of the wine. The flavors can range from ripe tropical fruit notes of melon and mango to some botrytis-influenced flavors. In Italy, Pinot grigio grapes are often harvested early to retain the refreshing acidity and minimize some of the overt-fruitiness of the variety, creating a more neutral flavor profile. This style is often imitated in other Old World wine regions, such as Germany, where the grape is known as Ruländer, or more commonly, Grauburgunder.

What are the benefits of the public cloud

### Response:
","The public cloud offers a global, standardized and harmonized infrastructure and networking environment. The cloud resources are operated by one of the large hyperscalers and are delivered over highly secure and reliable internet connections. 

Benefits and advantages of the public cloud are:

- High reliability: a large network of servers ensure against failures. Hyperscalers operate in datacenter regions across the globe and in availability zones. You can store a copy of your data up to three times and apply highest standards of business continuity and disaster recovery

- Lower costs: there is no need to purchase hardware and software and run an on-premise datacenter. The environment is harmonized and new hardware will be released constantly to make sure a great TCO is applied and the current compute can be optimized frequently

- Services availability: create a new resource at any time with all the services being available. No provisioning of hardware and software and pay only when you use them

- Innovation: the services are always up to date and cutting edge to make sure your business can lead with innovation

- Scalability: resources are provided on-demand and scale almost unlimited to meet your business needs

- Shared responsibility: the service provider provides the maintenance and operates in a shared responsibility model 

- PAYG: pay as you go and as you use the cloud services. No termination fees, no fixed and long-term binding contracts (unless you would like to save additional costs and sign a longer-term agreement with a cloud provider)

- Increased security: public cloud providers analyze trillions of signals every day and make sure the infrastructure is robust and highly secure against cyber attacks

- Trial and error: you can kick-off several new initiatives in parallel on a low-cost environment and stay flexible that if one of these projects fail, you will be able to shut down all the resources immediately

What is detection engineering and what are the benefits?

### Response:
","Detection engineering is a new approach to threat detection. More than just writing detection rules, detection engineering is a process—applying systems thinking and engineering to more accurately detect threats. The goal is to create an automated system of threat detection which is customizable, flexible, repeatable, and produces high quality alerts for security teams to act upon. Detection engineering is not yet a mature discipline with consistent methods and predictable results, but pioneers in the field are working towards this goal. There is not a lot written about the concept right now, no go-to standards or frameworks. It appears companies are developing their own approaches to incorporate the concept to improve their detection and response capabilities. 

A concept called detection-as-code (DaC), first coined by Anton Chuvakin in 2020, is at the heart of detection engineering, and points to the idea that detections should be treated as code. Essentially, it is about applying software engineering best practices to detections using modern agile CI/CD processes. 

The benefits Of Detection Engineering include 1) reduced mean-time-to-response through automation of detections, 2) detections are more relevant to the environment, 3) the process is structured, repeatable, and informs workflows, 4) detection rules and analytics are version controlled, reused, and modified as needed, 5) Peer review and automated testing are part of the process, to catch mistakes and gaps."

How reliable is public transportation?

### Response:
","Reliability of public transportation varies drastically depending on which city you are in and depends on investment and maintenance of existing infrastructure. For example, the public transportation network in Switzerland spans a wide network that comprises of trains, trams, busses, and ferries, runs timely on a schedule to the minute, and is used as a primary mode of transportation for many residents. In contrast, it can be challenging to get around many cities in the United States without a car. Public transportation ridership often depends on reliability, which in turn often determines the availability of investments in the required infrastructure. This creates an unfortunate cycle making it very difficult for public transportation to become more reliable without external investments where the system is funding itself."

### Response:
","The green light is a well known symbol used in the book the Great Gatsby, which can be seen to symbolize many different things. The color of the light is notable because green is a deeply symbolic color, and it is often associated with money and greed. Because the Great Gatsby is ultimately a story about wealth and excess, as well as human greed, this color is a purposeful choice to associate the idea of wealth always being just out of grasp. Additionally, the light ultimately symbolizes something which is just out of grasp, and can be seen as a metaphor of Jay Gatbsy's continuous pursuit of Daisy which was always destined to fail."

1 teaspoon sea salt
1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme
Freshly cracked black pepper
4 tablespoons (½ stick) unsalted butter
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon garlic powder
½ teaspoon onion powder
1 cup chicken broth
1 cup beef broth
1 ½ teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon Better Than Bouillon beef base or 1 beef bouillon cube
1 teaspoon unfiltered apple cider vinegar

Meanwhile, make the gravy. In a large saucepan set over medium heat, melt the butter. Sprinkle the flour over the butter and cook, stirring constantly, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Stir in the garlic powder and onion powder. Slowly add the chicken and beef broth. Increase the heat to medium high and bring to a boil, stirring often. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until thickened. Stir in the Worcestershire, beef bouillon, and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper.
To assemble the poutine, divide the fries among 4 plates. Sprinkle it with the cheese curds, drizzle on the gravy, and garnish with parsley. Serve immediately."

Given this paragraph, what is the definition of Long short-term memory ?
Long short-term memory (LSTM)[1] is an artificial neural network used in the fields of artificial intelligence and deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. Such a recurrent neural network (RNN) can process not only single data points (such as images), but also entire sequences of data (such as speech or video). This characteristic makes LSTM networks ideal for processing and predicting data. For example, LSTM is applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition,[2] speech recognition,[3][4] machine translation,[5][6] speech activity detection,[7] robot control,[8][9] video games,[10][11] and healthcare.[12]

The trophies have been awarded to the winners since 1953 and are manufactured by Mellerio dits Meller, a famous Parisian jewelry house. They are all made of pure silver with finely etched decorations on their side. Each new singles winner gets his or her name written on the base of the trophy. Winners receive custom-made pure silver replicas of the trophies they have won.[41] They are usually presented by the President of the French Tennis Federation (FFT).

The trophy awarded to the winner of the men's singles is called the Coupe des Mousquetaires (The Musketeers' Cup). It is named in honor of the ""Four Musketeers"". The trophy weighs 14 kg, is 40 cm high and 19 cm wide.[42] The current design was created in 1981 by the Mellerio dit Meller. Each winner gets a smaller-size replica and the original remains property of the FFT at all times.[43]

The trophy awarded to the winner of the women's singles is called the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen (Suzanne Lenglen Cup) since 1979. The current cup was awarded for the first time in 1986. It is, with a few details, a replica of a cup offered at the time by the city of Nice to Suzanne Lenglen. This trophy, donated by Suzanne Lenglen's family to the Musée National du Sport, was awarded between 1979 and 1985 to every winner until the FFT made a copy. Each winner receives a smaller-size replica and the original remains property of the FFT at all times.[43]

The Skate series distinguishes itself from other skateboarding video games with its unique control system, called ""Flick-it"", in which players execute tricks with brief, rapid movements of either or both analog sticks of a twin-stick gamepad.[1] Players assume the role of a customizable skater and freely explore a fictional city in an open world setting, completing diverse and increasingly difficult challenges while being filmed by cameraman Giovanni Reda to unlock new areas, obtain new cosmetics and eventually rise to stardom.[2] Along the way, they can encounter, compete with and even play as famous real-life skaters, including Danny Way, Terry Kennedy and Rob Dyrdek, and must eventually choose from among several authentic licensed skateboard gear firms to strike an endorsement with for exclusive skateboard parts and gear. Players can make use of session markers to quickly travel to or return to a location of their choosing. A special injury system called the ""Hall of Meat"" tracks injuries sustained during wipeouts, particularly broken bones, which is key to completing certain challenges.[3]

Please summarize the history of the development of Roche Percee based on this article
In 1872 the Boundary Commission travelled through this area while surveying the border between Canada and the United States. During the 1874 March West trek of the North-West Mounted Police, the force established its first camp (called Short Creek Camp) at this location. The community began being served by the Soo Line in 1893, permitting the coal mines in the region to become operational. Roche Percée incorporated as a village on January 12, 1909.[2]

### Response:
","Roche Percee was originally explored in 1872 by the Boundary Commission before a small camp was built in the area in 1874 by the North-West Mounted Police. The area then grew further after the establishment of the Soo Line train, with coal mining helping to grow the area. Eventually, Roche Percee was finally incorporated in the beginning of 1909."

The Tennessee River is the largest tributary of the Ohio River.[5] It is approximately 652 miles (1,049 km) long and is located in the southeastern United States in the Tennessee Valley. The river was once popularly known as the Cherokee River, among other names, as the Cherokee people had their homelands along its banks, especially in what are now East Tennessee and northern Alabama. Additionally, its tributary, the Little Tennessee River, flows into it from Western North Carolina and northeastern Georgia, where the river also was bordered by numerous Cherokee towns.[1] Its current name is derived from the Cherokee town, Tanasi, which was located on the Tennessee side of the Appalachian Mountains

Given these paragraphs about battery storage power stations, for how long a battery storage power station can output?
A battery storage power station is a type of energy storage power station that uses a group of batteries to store electrical energy. Battery storage is the fastest responding dispatchable source of power on electric grids, and it is used to stabilise those grids, as battery storage can transition from standby to full power in under a second to deal with grid contingencies.

At full rated power, battery storage power stations are generally designed to output for up to a few hours. Battery storage can be used for short-term peak power and ancillary services, such as providing operating reserve and frequency control to minimize the chance of power outages. They are often installed at, or close to, other active or disused power stations and may share the same grid connection to reduce costs. Since battery storage plants require no deliveries of fuel, are compact compared to generating stations and have no chimneys or large cooling systems, they can be rapidly installed and placed if necessary within urban areas, close to customer load.

What is the history of the Masters Golf Tournament
The Masters was started by amateur champion Bobby Jones and investment banker Clifford Roberts.[4] After his grand slam in 1930, Jones acquired the former plant nursery and co-designed Augusta National with course architect Alister MacKenzie.[1] First played 89 years ago in 1934, the tournament is an official money event on the PGA Tour, the European Tour, and the Japan Golf Tour. The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.

The tournament has a number of traditions. Since 1949, a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless they need to be re-fitted with a new jacket).[5] The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by Ben Hogan in 1952, is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in 1963, legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included Fred McLeod, Jock Hutchinson, Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Lee Elder, and Tom Watson. Since 1960, a semi-social contest at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.

Nicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. Tiger Woods won five between 1997 and 2019. Palmer won four between 1958 and 1964. Five have won three titles at Augusta: Jimmy Demaret, Sam Snead, Gary Player, Nick Faldo, and Phil Mickelson. Player, from South Africa, was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in 1961; the second was Seve Ballesteros of Spain, the champion in 1980 and 1983.

The Augusta National course first opened 90 years ago in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed.[6]

### Instruction:
Based on the following paragraph on drinking water, is there a risk of drinking too much water during exercising?
The human body contains from 55% to 78% water, depending on body size.[90][user-generated source?] To function properly, the body requires between one and seven liters (0.22 and 1.54 imp gal; 0.26 and 1.85 U.S. gal)[citation needed] of water per day to avoid dehydration; the precise amount depends on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. Most of this is ingested through foods or beverages other than drinking straight water. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy people, though the British Dietetic Association advises that 2.5 liters of total water daily is the minimum to maintain proper hydration, including 1.8 liters (6 to 7 glasses) obtained directly from beverages.[91] Medical literature favors a lower consumption, typically 1 liter of water for an average male, excluding extra requirements due to fluid loss from exercise or warm weather.[92]
Healthy kidneys can excrete 0.8 to 1 liter of water per hour, but stress such as exercise can reduce this amount. People can drink far more water than necessary while exercising, putting them at risk of water intoxication (hyperhydration), which can be fatal.[93][94] The popular claim that ""a person should consume eight glasses of water per day"" seems to have no real basis in science.[95] Studies have shown that extra water intake, especially up to 500 milliliters (18 imp fl oz; 17 U.S. fl oz) at mealtime, was associated with weight loss.[96][97][98][99][100][101] Adequate fluid intake is helpful in preventing constipation.[102]

### Response:
","Yes, since exercise induced stress can reduce the volume of water that the kidneys can excrete, drinking too much water during exercise can result in water intoxication which can be fatal."

What is oxidation reduction potential?

### Response:
","Oxidation reduction potential or ORP is measurement for water.  A millivolt meter can measure ORP and it is a measure of the potential of water to carry or hold antioxidants.  It is not a guarantee of antioxidants in water.  One form of antioxidants in water is free floating dissolved hydrogen.  A good analogy of antioxidants in water is the following: ORP is like a big swimming pool of potential but at the moment its currently empty and dissolved hydrogen is like ball of finite size.  The larger the ORP 'swimming pool' the more dissolved hydrogen 'balls' can fit in that pool.  An ORP with a large negative value is huge swimming pool, and an OPR with a high positive value is no swimming pool.  ORP can also measure whether water is acidic or alkaline.  ORP that is negative tends more toward alkaline water, and ORP which is positive tends more towards neutral water and acidic water."

What makes a Squishmallow resellable?
Due to the demand for the toy, Squishmallows are often sold by resellers for an increased price. The average resell price for a Squishmallow depends on the size, condition, and rarity of the specific item. Some limited edition or high-demand Squishmallows are sold by resellers and collectors for hundreds or thousands of dollars. Jack the Black Cat, known for its closed white eyes and white whiskers, is one of the rarest Squishmallows sold to date. KellyToys introduced the limited edition stuffed animal on their website in 2020, where it sold out within two hours.[17] Third party websites like eBay host listings for Jack the Black Cat valued at nearly $2,000.[18] Among the many Squishmallows that are sold, some of the most popular include Connor the Cow, Malcolm the Mushroom, Archie the Axolotl, and Philippe the Frog. There are reports that resellers are harassed and doxxed by the community.[19]

### Response:

A whiteboard (also known by the terms marker board, dry-erase board, dry-wipe board, and pen-board) is a glossy, usually white surface for making non-permanent markings. Whiteboards are analogous to blackboards, but with a smoother surface allowing for rapid marking and erasing of markings on their surface. The popularity of whiteboards increased rapidly in the mid-1990s and they have become a fixture in many offices, meeting rooms, school classrooms, public events and other work environments.

The term whiteboard is also used metaphorically in reference to features of computer software applications that simulate whiteboards. Such ""virtual tech whiteboards"" allow one or more people to write or draw images on a simulated canvas. This is a common feature of many virtual meeting, collaboration, and instant messaging applications. The term whiteboard is also used to refer to interactive whiteboards.

How was Netflix able to overcome Blockbuster’s industry dominance in home video rentals?

### Response:
","Blockbuster, at its peak, was raking in $6 billion in revenues when Netflix entered the market as a disruptor with mail-in-DVD service. When Netflix arrived, Blockbuster was already a mature offering with no innovation. It had 6000 stores nationwide, and the customer service could have been better, especially with late fees. Blockbuster collected customers' $800 million in late fees in 2006 alone.

Netflix’s mail-in-DVD service offered a lower performance for the customers as they had to pick titles on their portal pre- and wait for 2 to 3 days before they arrived in their mailbox. However, disgruntled customers from Blockbuster’s late fees switched to Netflix, which was the initial trigger. At first, Netflix's beachhead audience was the dissatisfied customers from Blockbuster.

Netflix is led by Reed Hastings, a visionary who made a bet on video streaming on the internet. With scarce resources spent on technology, Reed Hastings incorporated a “Freedom and responsibility” culture within Netflix. This propelled Netflix into the new era of winning in the subscription video streaming business model. Blockbuster meanwhile had expensive operations with 6000 stores and 25000 staff, while Netflix operated with two data centers and a few warehouses with less than 500 staff. Blockbuster eventually launched its online business. However, the 2008 financial crisis and the mounting debt they incurred for their investments in their online business was too much for the company, and they eventually filed for bankruptcy."

Given this reference text, in which year was the youth novel by R.M. Ballantyne - which inspired Golding's first novel - written?
Published in 1954, Lord of the Flies was Golding's first novel. The concept arose after Golding read what he deemed to be an unrealistic portrayal of stranded children in the youth novel The Coral Island: a Tale of the Pacific Ocean (1857) by R. M. Ballantyne, which includes themes of the civilising effect of Christianity and the importance of hierarchy and leadership. Golding asked his wife, Ann, if it would ""be a good idea if I wrote a book about children on an island, children who behave in the way children really would behave?""[3] As a result, the novel contains various references to The Coral Island, such as the rescuing naval officer's description of the boys' initial attempts at civilised cooperation as a ""[j]olly good show. Like the Coral Island.""[4] Golding's three central characters (Ralph, Piggy, and Jack) have also been interpreted as caricatures of Ballantyne's Coral Island protagonists.[5]

The Boston Marathon is an annual marathon race hosted by several cities and towns in greater Boston in eastern Massachusetts, United States. It is traditionally held on Patriots' Day, the third Monday of April.[1] Begun in 1897, the event was inspired by the success of the first marathon competition in the 1896 Summer Olympics.[2] The Boston Marathon is the world's oldest annual marathon and ranks as one of the world's best-known road racing events. It is one of six World Marathon Majors. Its course runs from Hopkinton in southern Middlesex County to Copley Square in Boston.

The Boston Athletic Association (B.A.A.) has organized this event annually since 1897,[3] except for 2020 when it was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, it was held later, in October. The race has been managed by DMSE Sports, Inc., since 1988. Amateur and professional runners from all over the world compete in the Boston Marathon each year, braving the hilly Massachusetts terrain and varying weather to take part in the race.

The event attracts 500,000 spectators each year, making it New England's most widely viewed sporting event.[4] Starting with just 15 participants in 1897, the event now attracts an average of about 30,000 registered participants each year, with 30,251 people entering in 2015.[5] The Centennial Boston Marathon in 1996 established a record as the world's largest marathon with 38,708 entrants, 36,748 starters, and 35,868 finishers.[4]

What are the seven wonders of the world?
The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, also known as the Seven Wonders of the World or simply the Seven Wonders, is a list of seven notable structures present during classical antiquity. The first known list of seven wonders dates back to the 2nd–1st century BC.

While the entries have varied over the centuries, the seven traditional wonders are the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Colossus of Rhodes, the Lighthouse of Alexandria, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, the Temple of Artemis, the Statue of Zeus at Olympia, and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Using modern-day countries, two of the wonders were located in Greece, two in Turkey, two in Egypt, and one in Iraq. Of the seven wonders, only the Pyramid of Giza, which is also by far the oldest of the wonders, still remains standing, with the others being destroyed over the centuries. There is scholarly debate over the exact nature of the Hanging Gardens, and there is doubt as to whether they existed at all.

What is the meaning of ""tidal coupling""?
Nomadism is a way of life in which people don't have a permanent place to live. Instead, they move around a certain area in search of food and grazing land.

### Response:
","Tidal coupling or synchronous rotation is what causes one astronomical object's face to be fixed pointing to another, just as the Moon's visible face is always pointing to the Earth. A coupled object takes the same amount of time to rotate about its axis as it does to translate around its companion. This synchronous rotation, also known as captured rotation or synchronous rotation, causes one hemisphere to point continuously toward the companion object. Normally, only the satellite couples around a larger planet, but if the mass difference between the two bodies and the distance between them is small, both objects may have a reciprocal tidal coupling, as Pluto and Charon do."

Given this paragraph about WWII, how many fatalities happened?
""World War II or the Second World War, often abbreviated as WWII or WW2, was a global conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945. The vast majority of the world's countries, including all of the great powers, fought as part of two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. Many participants threw their economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind this total war, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and the delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war.

World War II was by far the deadliest conflict in history; it resulted in an estimated 70 to 85 million fatalities, mostly among civilians. Tens of millions died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of the Axis defeat, Germany and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.

The causes of World War II are debated, but contributing factors included the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, Spanish Civil War, Second Sino-Japanese War, Soviet–Japanese border conflicts, the rise of fascism in Europe, and European tensions in the aftermath of World War I. World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. The United Kingdom and France subsequently declared war on Germany on 3 September. Under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union had partitioned Poland and marked out their """"spheres of influence"""" across Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, in a military alliance with Italy, Japan and other countries called the Axis. Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa, and the fall of France in mid-1940, the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire, with war in the Balkans, the aerial Battle of Britain, the Blitz of the United Kingdom, and the Battle of the Atlantic. On 22 June 1941, Germany led the European Axis powers in an invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the Eastern Front, the largest land theatre of war in history.""

How often should you brush your teeth?
Oral hygiene is the practice of keeping one's mouth clean and free of disease and other problems (e.g. bad breath) by regular brushing of the teeth (dental hygiene) and cleaning between the teeth. It is important that oral hygiene be carried out on a regular basis to enable prevention of dental disease and bad breath. The most common types of dental disease are tooth decay (cavities, dental caries) and gum diseases, including gingivitis, and periodontitis.[1]
General guidelines for adults suggest brushing at least twice a day with a fluoridated toothpaste: brushing last thing at night and at least on one other occasion.[2] Cleaning between the teeth is called interdental cleaning and is as important as tooth brushing.[3] This is because a toothbrush cannot reach between the teeth and therefore only removes about 50% of plaque from the surface of the teeth.[4] There are many tools to clean between the teeth, including floss, tape and interdental brushes; it is up to each individual to choose which tool they prefer to use.

### Response:
","Oral Hygiene is important to maintain a healthy mouth free of disease.   Keeping one's mouth clean avoids problems such as bad breath as well as tooth decay, gum disease and gingivitis.  General guidelines for adults suggest brushing at least twice a day with fluoridated toothpaste.   A good strategy is to brush your teeth in the morning and before you go to bed each night."

List the name of the areas surrounding Greece and group by directions from the passage. List the results in comma separated format.
Greece,[a] officially the Hellenic Republic,[b] is a country in Southeast Europe. It is situated on the southern tip of the Balkan Peninsula, and is located at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Greece shares land borders with Albania to the northwest, North Macedonia and Bulgaria to the north, and Turkey to the northeast. The Aegean Sea lies to the east of the mainland, the Ionian Sea to the west, and the Sea of Crete and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. Greece has the longest coastline on the Mediterranean Basin, featuring thousands of islands. The country consists of nine traditional geographic regions, and has a population of approximately 10.5 million. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki and Patras.

Greece is considered the cradle of Western civilization, being the birthplace of democracy, Western philosophy, Western literature, historiography, political science, major scientific and mathematical principles, theatre and the Olympic Games. From the eighth century BC, the Greeks were organised into various independent city-states, known as poleis (singular polis), which spanned the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Philip II of Macedon united most of present-day Greece in the fourth century BC, with his son Alexander the Great rapidly conquering much of the ancient world, from the eastern Mediterranean to the North Western parts of India. The subsequent Hellenistic period saw the height of Greek culture and influence in antiquity. Greece was annexed by Rome in the second century BC, becoming an integral part of the Roman Empire and its continuation, the Byzantine Empire, which was culturally and linguistically predominantly Greek. The Greek Orthodox Church, which emerged in the first century AD, helped shape modern Greek identity and transmitted Greek traditions to the wider Orthodox world. After falling under Ottoman rule in the mid-15th century, Greece emerged as a modern nation state in 1830 following a war of independence. Over the first hundred years the kingdom of Greece sought its territorial expansion, which was mainly achieved in the early 20th century, during the Balkan Wars and up until the catastrophe of Greece's Asia Minor Campaign in 1922. The short-lived republic that followed, beset by the ramifications of civil strife, came to an end in 1936, when the imposition of a royalist dictatorship inaugurated a long period of authoritarian rule, marked by military occupation during World War II, civil war and military dictatorship. Greece achieved record economic growth from 1950 through the 1970s, allowing it to join the ranks of developed nations. Democracy was restored in 1974–75, and Greece has been a parliamentary republic ever since. The country's rich historical legacy is reflected in part by its 18 UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

Given these paragraphs about Large language models, what are relevant dimensions influencing the skill with which they accomplish tasks, and the range of tasks at which they are capable?
A large language model (LLM) is a language model consisting of a neural network with many parameters (typically billions of weights or more), trained on large quantities of unlabelled text using self-supervised learning. LLMs emerged around 2018 and perform well at a wide variety of tasks. This has shifted the focus of natural language processing research away from the previous paradigm of training specialized supervised models for specific tasks.

Properties
Though the term large language model has no formal definition, it often refers to deep learning models having a parameter count on the order of billions or more. LLMs are general purpose models which excel at a wide range of tasks, as opposed to being trained for one specific task (such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or mathematical reasoning). The skill with which they accomplish tasks, and the range of tasks at which they are capable, seems to be a function of the amount of resources (data, parameter-size, computing power) devoted to them, in a way that is not dependent on additional breakthroughs in design.

Though trained on simple tasks along the lines of predicting the next word in a sentence, neural language models with sufficient training and parameter counts are found to capture much of the syntax and semantics of human language. In addition, large language models demonstrate considerable general knowledge about the world, and are able to ""memorize"" a great quantity of facts during training.

Hallucinations
Main article: Hallucination (artificial intelligence)
In artificial intelligence in general, and in large language models in particular, a ""hallucination"" is a confident response that does not seem to be justified by the model's training data.

Emergent abilities

On a number of natural language benchmarks involving tasks such as question answering, models perform no better than random chance until they reach a certain scale (in this case, measured by training computation), at which point their performance sharply increases. These are examples of emergent abilities.
Unpredictable abilities that have been observed in large language models but that were not present in simpler models (and that were not explicitly designed into the model) are usually called ""emergent abilities"". Researchers note that such abilities ""cannot be predicted simply by extrapolating the performance of smaller models"". These abilities are discovered rather than programmed-in or designed, in some cases only after the LLM has been publicly deployed. Hundreds of emergent abilities have been described. Examples include multi-step arithmetic, taking college-level exams, identifying the intended meaning of a word, chain-of-thought prompting,[3] decoding the International Phonetic Alphabet, unscrambling a word’s letters, identifying offensive content in paragraphs of Hinglish (a combination of Hindi and English), and generating a similar English equivalent of Kiswahili proverbs.

Architecture and training
Large language models have most commonly used the transformer architecture, which, since 2018, has become the standard deep learning technique for sequential data (previously, recurrent architectures such as the LSTM were most common). LLMs are trained in an unsupervised manner on unannotated text. A left-to-right transformer is trained to maximize the probability assigned to the next word in the training data, given the previous context. Alternatively, an LLM may use a bidirectional transformer (as in the example of BERT), which assigns a probability distribution over words given access to both preceding and following context. In addition to the task of predicting the next word or ""filling in the blanks"", LLMs may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution such as Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear side-by-side in the training corpus.

The earliest LLMs were trained on corpora having on the order of billions of words. The first model in OpenAI's GPT series was trained in 2018 on BookCorpus, consisting of 985 million words. In the same year, BERT was trained on a combination of BookCorpus and English Wikipedia, totalling 3.3 billion words. In the years since then, training corpora for LLMs have increased by orders of magnitude, reaching up to hundreds of billions or trillions of tokens.

LLMs are computationally expensive to train. A 2020 study estimated the cost of training a 1.5 billion parameter model (1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than the state of the art at the time) at $1.6 million.

A 2020 analysis found that neural language models' capability (as measured by training loss) increased smoothly in a power law relationship with number of parameters, quantity of training data, and computation used for training.[11][12] These relationships were tested over a wide range of values (up to seven orders of magnitude) and no attenuation of the relationship was observed at the highest end of the range (including for network sizes up to trillions of parameters).

Application to downstream tasks
Between 2018 and 2020, the standard method for harnessing an LLM for a specific natural language processing (NLP) task was to fine tune the model with additional task-specific training. It has subsequently been found that more powerful LLMs such as GPT-3 can solve tasks without additional training via ""prompting"" techniques, in which the problem to be solved is presented to the model as a text prompt, possibly with some textual examples of similar problems and their solutions.

Fine-tuning
Main article: Fine-tuning (machine learning)
Fine-tuning is the practice of modifying an existing pretrained language model by training it (in a supervised fashion) on a specific task (e.g. sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or part-of-speech tagging). It is a form of transfer learning. It generally involves the introduction of a new set of weights connecting the final layer of the language model to the output of the downstream task. The original weights of the language model may be ""frozen"", such that only the new layer of weights connecting them to the output are learned during training. Alternatively, the original weights may receive small updates (possibly with earlier layers frozen).

Prompting
See also: Prompt engineering and Few-shot learning (natural language processing)
In the prompting paradigm, popularized by GPT-3, the problem to be solved is formulated via a text prompt, which the model must solve by providing a completion (via inference). In ""few-shot prompting"", the prompt includes a small number of examples of similar (problem, solution) pairs. For example, a sentiment analysis task of labelling the sentiment of a movie review could be prompted as follows:

Review: This movie stinks.
Sentiment: negative

Review: This movie is fantastic!
Sentiment:

If the model outputs ""positive"", then it has correctly solved the task. In zero-shot prompting, no solve examples are provided. An example of a zero-shot prompt for the same sentiment analysis task would be ""The sentiment associated with the movie review 'This movie is fantastic!' is"".

Few-shot performance of LLMs has been shown to achieve competitive results on NLP tasks, sometimes surpassing prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Examples of such NLP tasks are translation, question answering, cloze tasks, unscrambling words, and using a novel word in a sentence. The creation and optimisation of such prompts is called prompt engineering.

Instruction tuning
Instruction tuning is a form of fine-tuning designed to facilitate more natural and accurate zero-shot prompting interactions. Given a text input, a pretrained language model will generate a completion which matches the distribution of text on which it was trained. A naive language model given the prompt ""Write an essay about the main themes of Hamlet."" might provide a completion such as ""A late penalty of 10% per day will be applied to submissions received after March 17."" In instruction tuning, the language model is trained on many examples of tasks formulated as natural language instructions, along with appropriate responses. Various techniques for instruction tuning have been applied in practice. OpenAI's InstructGPT protocol involves supervised fine-tuning on a dataset of human-generated (prompt, response) pairs, followed by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), in which a reward function was learned based on a dataset of human preferences. Another technique, ""self-instruct"", fine-tunes the language model on a training set of examples which are themselves generated by an LLM (bootstrapped from a small initial set of human-generated examples).

","Combinatorial optimisation is a field of applied mathematics, combining techniques from combinatorics, linear programming, and the theory of algorithms, to solve discrete optimisation problems. It is usually used as an alias of discrete optimisation. A combinatorial optimisation problem can generally be drawn as a triple (S, f, C), where S is a given search space, f is the objective function, which should be either maximised or minimised, and C is the set of constraints that have to be fulfilled to obtain feasible solutions. The goal is to find a globally optimal solution, meaning a solution s' that belongs to S, with either the highest or lowest objective value in the case of maximisation or minimisation, each under the restriction of constraints."

Why is nitrogen gas used during the packaging of potato chips?

### Response:
","The Brits call them “crisps” for a reason. Three reasons at least for using 100% nitrogen:

Nitrogen contains no oxygen like air does which oxidizes the potatoes and promotes bacteria growth.
Nitrogen contains no water, which removes “crispness” from the chips and promotes bacteria growth.
Nitrogen inflates the bag which protects the chips, but, honestly, that could be done with air which costs less than pure nitrogen. But we know the downsides of air, don’t we?"

Using examples taken from the text give me a list of the first generation of ""skyscrapers"" located in the city of Chicago.
Early Chicago Skyscrapers is a nomination comprising nine buildings in Chicago's Loop district for inclusion on UNESCO's World Heritage Site list.Submitted by the US Department of the Interior in 2017, it is currently on the tentative list considered for nomination as a UNESCO designated World Heritage Site. Only properties that have been previously listed on a tentative list can be nominated for the World Heritage List.

These buildings were constructed in the last 20 years of the 19th century and represent the first generation of ""skyscrapers"", high-rise structures reaching up to 20 stories. Construction of these buildings employed novel approaches and technologies, such as the use of steel frames, first elevators, electric lights, and terracotta fireproofing. The architects developed a new aesthetics for the exterior of this new type of buildings. The skyscrapers listed are the Auditorium Building, Second Leiter Building, Marquette Building, Rookery Building, Monadnock Building, Old Colony Building, Fisher Building, Schlesinger & Mayer Building, and Ludington Building.

### Response:
","Early Chicago Skyscrapers is a term which describes the nine buildings in the Loop district of Chicago, Illinois in the United States.

Why should I read books?

### Response:
","Books can be our best friends. We can carry them anywhere with us and get immersed in them. Books are also a great source of knowledge and developing perspective. One can learn about new technologies, historical events, places to visit and more. Finally books also help us focus our mind on something specific for a long duration instead of jumping around to various things when browsing the internet."

### Instruction:
What are the benefits of building a large language model specific to your organization rather than using a third party vendor's model?

### Response:
","Building your own large language model (LLM) reduces security risks from data leakage, which could allow others to access your proprietary information. Building an in-house LLM also creates value internal to your organization rather than delivering that value (in the form of your data) to a third party. The answers from a custom LLM will also be more valid and specific to your organization. Finally, building your own LLM can be more cost effective than paying for each API request to a third party solution."

What is molecular biology?

### Response:
","Molecular biology is the branch of biology that seeks to understand the molecular basis of biological activity in and between cells, including biomolecular synthesis, modification, mechanisms, and interactions.[ The study of chemical and physical structure of biological macromolecules is known as molecular biology.

Molecular biology was first described as an approach focused on the underpinnings of biological phenomena - uncovering the structures of biological molecules as well as their interactions, and how these interactions explain observations of classical biology.

In 1945 the term molecular biology was used by physicist William Astbury. In 1953 Francis Crick, James Watson, Rosalind Franklin, and colleagues, working at Medical Research Council unit, Cavendish laboratory, Cambridge (now the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology), made a double helix model of DNA which changed the entire research scenario. They proposed the DNA structure based on previous research done by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins. This research then lead to finding DNA material in other microorganisms, plants and animals.

Molecular biology is not simply the study of biological molecules and their interactions; rather, it is also a collection of techniques developed since the field's genesis which have enabled scientists to learn about molecular processes.[6] In this way it has both complemented and improved biochemistry and genetics as methods (of understanding nature) that began before its advent. One notable technique which has revolutionized the field is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which was developed in 1983. PCR is a reaction which amplifies small quantities of DNA, and it is used in many applications across scientific disciplines.

The central dogma of molecular biology describes the process in which DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into protein.

Molecular biology also plays a critical role in the understanding of structures, functions, and internal controls within individual cells, all of which can be used to efficiently target new drugs, diagnose disease, and better understand cell physiology. Some clinical research and medical therapies arising from molecular biology are covered under gene therapy whereas the use of molecular biology or molecular cell biology in medicine is now referred to as molecular medicine."
