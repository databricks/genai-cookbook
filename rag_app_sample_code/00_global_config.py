# MAGIC ## Application configuration
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To begin with, we simply need to configure the following:
# MAGIC 1. `RAG_APP_NAME`: The name of the RAG application.  Used to name the app's Unity Catalog model and is prepended to the output Delta Tables + Vector Indexes
# MAGIC 2. `UC_CATALOG` & `UC_SCHEMA`: [Create a Unity Catalog](https://docs.databricks.com/en/data-governance/unity-catalog/create-catalogs.html#create-a-catalog) and a Schema where the output Delta Tables with the parsed/chunked documents and Vector Search indexes are stored
# MAGIC 3. `UC_MODEL_NAME`: Unity Catalog location to log and store the chain's model
# MAGIC 4. `VECTOR_SEARCH_ENDPOINT`: [Create a Vector Search Endpoint](https://docs.databricks.com/en/generative-ai/create-query-vector-search.html#create-a-vector-search-endpoint) to host the resulting vector index
# MAGIC 5. `SOURCE_PATH`: A [UC Volume](https://docs.databricks.com/en/connect/unity-catalog/volumes.html#create-and-work-with-volumes) that contains the source documents for your application.
# MAGIC 6. `MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_NAME`: MLflow Experiment to track all experiments for this application.  Using the same experiment allows you to track runs across Notebooks and have unified lineage and governance for your application.
# MAGIC 7. `EVALUATION_SET_FQN`: Delta Table where your evaluation set will be stored.  In the POC, we will seed the evaluation set with feedback you collect from your stakeholders.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC After finalizing your configuration, optionally run `01_validate_config` to check that all locations exist. 

# COMMAND ----------

# By default, will use the current user name to create a unique UC catalog/schema & vector search endpoint
user_email = spark.sql("SELECT current_user() as username").collect()[0].username
user_name = user_email.split("@")[0].replace(".", "").lower()[:35]

# Source location for documents
# You need to create this location and add files
